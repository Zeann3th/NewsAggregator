      "article_detailed_content": "Gaming has been a catalyst in resurrecting Web3 from a year-long winter. It\u2019s also a key force for mass adoption. Yet, the journey towards fully realizing the potential of Web3 gaming is fraught with challenges, notably the seamless integration of on-chain elements without sacrificing the core tenets of decentralization and player empowerment.\nNew users should only experience friction if necessary, and as late as possible. That\u2019s not the case with most existing Web3 games. From connecting their wallets upfront to signing transactions for verification, users face multiple hurdles before actually trying the game. These frictions contrast starkly with the vision of a seamless and accessible gaming world that fully on-chain gaming aspires to achieve.\nTitles such as Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties, though groundbreaking, fall short of being fully on-chain. Fully on-chain games store all game assets, mechanics, and states on the blockchain. This radical approach ensures unparalleled transparency, security, and player control, allowing for a truly decentralized gaming experience where players own and shape their digital destinies.\nRelated: Axie Infinity is toxic for crypto gaming\nBuilding the best game demands a functional, efficient combination of on-chain elements and the rich user experience of legacy titles.\nHolding Web3 games to Web2 standards is comparing apples to oranges. Their requirements, value propositions, and scopes differ greatly despite serving similar audiences.\nWeb3 games are meant to solve age-old problems like top-down models, lack of user control, and strong-arming by gaming corporations. That\u2019ll happen only by implementing alternative models, processes, and principles \u2014 not by emulating the outcomes achieved in Web2.\nWe can even argue that terms like \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201cseamless,\u201d and \u201chassle-free,\u201d will take on new meanings in this context, enhanced by other aspects like community orientation, real in-game value, and user-generated logic.\nTherefore, when building Web3 games, the most crucial requirement is to address novel challenges, ideally involving embracing innovative technologies and models that align with the principles of autonomy and community governance. It\u2019s about building \u201cAutonomous Worlds\u201d (AWs), a concept introduced in 2022 by Ludens \u2014 the founder of Lattice.xyz \u2014 to describe \u201ca world with a blockchain substrate.\u201d\nMoreover, new-age games must nurture and serve the expanding community of problem-aware gamers. Those who seek genuine solutions to the odds stacked against them in legacy gaming. Not mere bounty hunters and fleeting profit-mongers.\nBuilding fully on-chain games\nIronically, Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties served as pivotal catalysts in the evolution of blockchain gaming \u2014 but they weren't fully on-chain. They were experimental, niche, and heavily crypto-centric, characterized by their clunky user interfaces. Despite opening up new avenues, they weren\u2019t entirely \"Autonomous Worlds\" either. Users had little or no control over the rules and direction of the game, and only parts of the game states were on-chain.\nneed help my ship is stuck in the ░F░O░G░ pic.twitter.com/Hn6jn3NTOK\n\u2014 The Citadel (@0xCitadel) March 6, 2024\nDark Forest was the first decentralized real-time strategy game, released in 2020. Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkProofs), a cryptographic protocol, to create a \u201cfog of war\u201d in the gaming experience, this project set an example in building incomplete information games on-chain. For reference, think of games like poker, where players only see their hands and don\u2019t know what cards others have.\nThe challenge Dark Forest tackled was maintaining a publicly accessible distributed ledger without compromising the confidentiality of players' strategies \u2014 a fundamental aspect in any strategic gameplay.\nUsing zkProofs, Dark Forest maintained gameplay integrity and player privacy on a blockchain. This approach solved the critical issue of revealing sensitive game states (e.g., planet locations or attack trajectories), which is easily manageable with centralized servers but very challenging in decentralized environments. Dark Forest's solution set a precedent for real-time strategy gaming on the blockchain, providing a blueprint for future on-chain game development.\nThey even sparked the proliferation of community-oriented, bottom-up AWs: Mithraeum, Citadel, ZkHunt, and so on. Loot Project was another interesting addition to this space, letting users permissionlessly expand the IP and spawning hundreds of games, lores, etc.\nMithraeum. Source: Screenshot\nBy putting everything on-chain \u2014 from game states (assets, actions, etc.) to logic (rules of introduction, mechanisms for in-game interactions, etc.), AWs unlock flexible and resilient digital realities where users come of their own.\nGoing beyond in-game asset ownership, they incentivize players to attach greater significance to their on-chain gaming activities. More importantly, on-chain logic provides gamers with a meaningful say in what\u2019s legitimate and what\u2019s not in the game-world.\nThis is a massive departure from the status quo, where end-users are mostly passive consumers, playing at the whims and mercy of corporate publishers. Rules and norms emerge via community consensus, not the arbitrary will of external entities. And they serve grassroots interests. Players can build, contribute, monetize, and participate in ways that are impossible in Web2 games.\nRelated: Why Solana will prevail despite Ethereum ETFs\nThe empowering, skin-in-the-game nature of AWs instills a stronger desire for mastery in gamers. They\u2019re more driven to find creative solutions to solve problems and create mods and plugins to establish entirely separate economies within the game. This participatory fosters a deeper connection to the game, encouraging creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration within the community. For example, Dark Forest players have built a range of bots, plugins, and custom clients they can use to climb a leaderboard.\nAs we look to the future, the journey towards fully on-chain gaming is not without its challenges, yet the promise it holds is immense. By redefining engagement, ownership, and control within the digital realm, on-chain gaming is poised to offer experiences that more closely mirror real-world interactions and relationships. In doing so, it not only enhances the richness of virtual worlds but also establishes a new standard for what gaming can be\u2014truly immersive, empowering, and reflective of the players' desires and aspirations.\nThe principles of decentralization, player sovereignty, and community collaboration will be the guiding lights, shaping the future of gaming into an inclusive, democratic, and exciting digital frontier.\nFelix Xu is a co-founder and CEO of ARPA.

      "article_detailed_content": "Bank customers and the United States economy could lose opportunities if a poor approach is taken to regulating blockchain technology, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) vice chair Travis Hill told an audience at the Mercatus Center think tank on March 11. The United States is already at risk, Hill said, and the FDIC shares the blame for that.\nTokenization of bank deposits and other real-world assets (RWA) could make it possible to carry out financial transaction at any time with real-time settlement, Hill said. In addition, it would provide programmability of payments, making it possible to conduct intraday repurchase (repo) exchanges and improve settlement times for some bond issuances and numerous other transactions. Consumers could also benefit from using programmable payments in place of escrow.\nAmong the many open questions about tokenization, Hill mentioned the use, or not, of unified ledgers, blockchain interoperability and ownership rights as assets move along the blockchain. Furthermore:\n\u201cGlobal standards are being established, directly or indirectly, and with many non-U.S. jurisdictions actively engaged in this area, the United States risks ceding influence at this critical stage.\u201d\nProgrammability could reduce settlement risks and Know Your Customer processes, but it could also allow consumers to move their assets quickly, aggravating bank runs. An \u201coff\u201d switch is needed to prevent that, Hill said.\nSource: @FDICgov on X\nRegulatory agencies attempted in the past to set consistent policies with little luck, so \u201cinstead, the agencies established processes under which institutions must engage with their regulator on an individual basis,\u201d Hill said.\nRelated: Inspector General wants FDIC to refine crypto risk assessment process, guidance\nLooking at FDIC regulations, which treat all transactions on a blockchain \u2014 whether they involve RWA or crypto \u2014 the same, Hill found them to be cumbersome and unequally applied:\n\u201cInstitutions have spent months responding to a long stream of information requests, diverting attention away from developing new technologies and systems. [\u2026] The message being heard by the vast majority of the industry could be interpreted as don't bother trying.\u201d\nGuidance is needed from regulators, as is consistency so that deposits in any form are treated the same, Hill said. He criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which requires financial institutions to treat crypto assets differently from any other kind of asset. The definition of crypto asset used in the bulletin is broad enough to include tokenized RWA, he said.\nMagazine: Block by block: Blockchain technology is transforming the real estate market\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest news in crypto legislation and regulations.

      "article_detailed_content": "Israel\u2019s central bank will support a new Israeli shekel central bank digital currency (CBDC) that has the option of bearing interest.\nIn the March 11 announcement, the Bank of Israel outlined that its shekel CBDC will be implemented in a two-tier model, with instant, 24/7 payments, multipayment support, offline use, limitations on balances and an option for the CBDC to become interest-bearing. The central bank wrote: \n\u201cIn the area of privacy, the architecture will allow the central bank, as the system administrator, to define the types of information required for the operation, control, and monitoring of the system. However, the central bank will not have access to personally identifiable information about end users\u2019 balances and transactions.\u201d\nCurrently, commercial banks in Israel pay 4.86% interest on customers\u2019 fiat shekel deposits and savings. Under the central bank\u2019s plans, banks would be able to hold the shekel CBDC as part of their short-term liquidity buffer, which would be non-interest bearing. \n\u201cThe data structure must enable the system to comply with all of the assumptions defined in Section 2.1, including the ability to enforce holding restrictions and to apply interest,\u201d researchers wrote, adding: \u201cIn particular, in a case where the interest is dependent on the type of user and the size of the balance, there is an advantage to having a centralized database.\u201d\nIsrael has been contemplating the issuance of a digital shekel since 2021, but no concrete pilot tests have been actioned as of the time of publication. \u201cGiven the interdependence between the various components of the digital shekel system, the decisions are not final,\u201d said the Bank of Israel. \nIn April 2023, Cointelegraph reported that the country\u2019s central bank could issue a shekel CBDC if stablecoin use increases. \u201cAt this point, there are no signs of substantial adoption of stablecoins as means of payment in Israel,\u201d the central bank said at the time.\nRelated: Local Web3 community launches \u2018Crypto Aid Israel\u2019 to help displaced citizens\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

      "article_detailed_content": "Independent (indie) musicians face many challenges on their way to recognition and financial stability, often stemming from the centralized nature of Web2 platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music and SoundCloud. While these platforms initially offered promising paths to exposure, the reality has fallen short, leaving artists struggling to secure fair compensation in terms of royalties and control over their work.\nThe issue lies in the way streaming services distribute revenue: a meager portion reaches the artists themselves, with record labels often negotiating significantly higher payouts than indie musicians for their work. Spotify\u2019s reported payout per stream further exemplifies this disparity, falling within a paltry range of $0.003 to $0.005 in 2024.\nAdding insult to injury, Spotify\u2019s recent policy change throws another obstacle in the path of indie artists. In 2024, the platform will cease royalties for tracks receiving fewer than 1,000 streams within a year. While technicalities suggest these tracks will still accrue royalties, the funds will be funneled upward, often benefiting bigger artists. This 1,000-stream cliff creates a significant barrier for indie musicians attempting to break through and build a fanbase.\nOne stat you won\u2019t find in your Spotify Wrapped is how much artists are paid for all that listening on the platform.\n\nThe max possible in 2023 is $0.003 per stream. And in 2024, Spotify will stop paying anything AT ALL for 2/3 of the tracks on the platform. pic.twitter.com/OCMHsHNce5\n\u2014 United Musicians and Allied Workers (@UMAW_) November 29, 2023\nAnother major challenge for indie artists is building a loyal fanbase. The current market is saturated with countless independent artists vying for attention. Building a personal brand and effectively utilizing social media platforms can help indie musicians connect with their audience and cultivate a fanbase, but it takes time, money and effort to make it big.\nHow NFTs can help musicians\nThis is where Web3, particularly nonfungible tokens (NFTs), emerges as a solution with the potential to transform the indie music industry. Music NFTs allow artists to sell songs, albums or exclusive digital content directly to their fans. The NFT approach bypasses intermediaries like record labels and streaming platforms, allowing artists to capture a larger share of the revenue generated by their work. Unlike streaming, where earnings are based on unpredictable play counts, NFTs offer the potential for more transparent and direct income streams.\nMusic NFTs also act as a bridge between artists and their fans, fostering a sense of community and ownership. By owning an NFT, fans actively support the artist and gain access to various benefits like early access to new songs or exclusive behind-the-scenes content.\nThe limitations of current music NFTs\nWhile music NFTs already exist on several blockchains, they can only represent one digital asset, such as a single song. This restriction is highly inflexible, as musicians typically work with multiple songs packaged as an album or playlist.\nThe current music NFTs are permanently static, lacking the capacity for updates or changes. Musicians desire the ability to evolve and modify their music and copyright terms over time, enhancing fan engagement by offering a continuous stream of fresh content.\nAlthough music NFTs hold great promise for fostering deeper connections with fan bases, this potential hinges on one critical factor \u2014 the ability to update the information embedded in the NFT itself.\nIntroducing dynamic Data NFTs\nItheum Protocol, an omni-chain data ownership infrastructure layer , aims to overcome these limitations by allowing musicians to develop and update their content through its Music Data NFT technology.\nAt the heart of the Itheum Protocol lies Data NFT technology, which allows musicians to transform static or dynamic data assets into NFTs. These NFTs function as transferable licenses, granting ownership and control over sharing or trading access rights to the data. Data NFTs empower creators to tokenize their data, similar to other NFT assets, but with the added flexibility of managing access rights.\nUnlike traditional NFTs that represent static assets, Music Data NFTs can be updated by artists, allowing for evolving content. This dynamic capability has the potential to enhance fan engagement, offering features like unlocking additional content upon interaction. Moreover, Music Data NFTs give artists greater control over distribution and royalty structures.\nVerified fans who own Data NFTs can also establish direct communication with artists, creating access opportunities for exclusive content such as unreleased music or merchandise. This connection could strengthen the bond between musicians and their fanbase.\nCointelegraph Accelerator participant Itheum envisions Music Data NFTs operating seamlessly across various blockchains. The envisioned interoperability enables artists to access diverse NFT ecosystems, potentially building fanbases and extending their exposure to a broader audience across various blockchain communities.\nKey features of Data NFTs. Source: Itheum Protocol\nGiving the power to musicians and fans\nMusicians can showcase their Music Data NFTs on NF.Tunes, a Web3 music portal built on Itheum Protocol\u2019s technology. The platform serves as a space for artists to exhibit their music Data NFTs, allowing fans to explore and listen to new music while engaging with artist communities.\nWith its Music Data NFTs, Itheum paves the way for a more artist-centric future in the music industry. By addressing the limitations of the current NFT models, Itheum offers a glimpse into a future where indie musicians not only navigate the labyrinthine world of music but thrive in it.\nAre you an indie musician who wants to use Music Data NFTs?

I think the institutions are trying as hard as they can not to let that happen,\u201d he said.\nAccording to his brother, Aaron, the big differentiator between this and previous bull runs is that spot ETFs have allowed Bitcoin to cross the chasm between early adopters and the early majority, referencing the lifecycle of technology adoption. \n\u201cWall Street is in for real this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a big differentiator.\u201d \nAt the same time, they said the bulk of retail investors have not entered the market yet, which seems to suggest that we are still in a relatively early stage of the bull market.\n\u201cRetail largely isn\u2019t here yet based on the social engagement, on Google Trends,\u201d Austin said. \nTo find out more about Altcoin Daily\u2019s outlook on the current bull market, check out the full interview on Cointelegraph\u2019s YouTube channel \u2014 and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!",

This latest move, made through its Strategic Innovation Lab, sets the stage for Ubisoft to contribute to the XPLA network beyond principal validation duties.\nAccording to a press release from XPLA, Ubisoft will \u201cactively participate in governance proposal decisions\u201d as part of the partnership. \nBlockchain\nXPLA is a Tendermint-based, layer-1, open-source blockchain developed to foster the transition from Web2 to Web3 gaming. Its mainnet was launched in August 2022 with the stated core goal of empowering players in a \u201cplay to own\u201d gaming paradigm.\nSome of the most popular intellectual properties with games on the XPLA blockchain include The Walking Dead: All-Stars and Summoners War: Chronicles.\nPer a blog post from XPLA, its latest partnership is a growth marker for the network:\n\u201cThe addition of Ubisoft, a global gaming company, to the XPLA family is just the beginning! We eagerly anticipate more validators joining our ecosystem, enhancing the security and stability of our network.\u201d\nGaming\nUbisoft, based in Rennes, France, is among the world\u2019s largest gaming companies. Its games have won myriad awards and sold a combined total of somewhere around 800 million titles. With a market capitalization of $2.75 billion as of the time of publication, it\u2019s the second largest in Europe, behind only Poland\u2019s CD Projekt Red ($2.99 billion).\nThe company was among the earliest gaming firms to invest in Web3 and blockchain technology. Back in 2021, it published a manifesto laying out its plans in the blockchain and Web3 spaces with heavy emphasis on player agency and ownership.\nAs Cointelegraph reported in October 2021, Ubisoft is also a major investor in Animoca Brands, a Hong Kong-based blockchain games developer. \nBlockchain gaming continues to rise in popularity as the Web3 space begins to fill out. While it still hasn\u2019t reached its early promises of decentralizing gaming assets at scale and revolutionizing the role of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in the public perception, the steady entrance of major gaming outfits such as Ubisoft and Square-Enix bodes well for the sector.\nRelated: Square Enix will modify organizational structure to support blockchain, Web3, AI in 2024\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Nifty Newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest NFT headlines.

      "article_detailed_content": "Major stablecoin operator Tether continues to expand its USDT stablecoin across various blockchain networks, entering a strategic collaboration with the Celo network.\nTether (USDT) on Celo, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible layer-1 network designed for fast and low-cost payments.\nAnnouncing the news to Cointelegraph on March 11, Tether noted that the new integration brings a range of benefits to USDT, including \u201cnotably low, sub-cent transaction fees\u201d hovering around $0.001, enabling feasible microtransactions.\n\u201cOne of Celo\u2019s core features since launching in April 2020 was its design for fast, low-cost payments worldwide,\u201d a source close to Celo told Cointelegraph. \u201cIndirectly, as an L2, there is a value sharing happening with Ethereum that\u2019s not happening today as an L1,\u201d a spokesperson said, adding:\n\u201cIn transitioning to an Ethereum L2, gas fees would stay low, critical to achieving global prosperity and core to the Celo community mission.\u201d\nUSDT will join an array of stable assets available on the Celo platform, including Mento\u2019s eXOF, which tracks the CFA franc, and the cREAL, which tracks the Brazilian real. The use cases for stable assets on Celo include remittances, savings, lending and cross-border payments.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Tether USDT to the Celo ecosystem, which is fast becoming a leader in stablecoins and real-world assets,\u201d Celo co-founder and foundation president Rene Reinsberg said.\n\u201cWith Tether USDT soon available on Celo, users have even more options for fast, low-cost payments and access to robust stablecoin use cases that benefit everyday users around the world,\u201d Reinsberg noted.\nA Tether representative declined to say when the first batch of USDT will be issued and go live on the Celo blockchain.\nRelated: Tether launches recovery tool to migrate USDT between blockchains\nUSDT\u2019s major rival, the Circle-issued USD Coin (USDC), announced a native launch on the Celo blockchain in January 2024 as well. Circle said the first USDC became available on Celo on Feb. 22.\nCelo-based USDT will join 14 blockchains currently supported by Tether, including Tron, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and Omni. Tron and Ethereum are the two largest blockchains for USDT at the time of writing, accounting for 50% and 45% of all issued USDT, respectively, according to Tether Transparency.\nThe news comes amid the crypto community increasingly complaining about high fees on the Ethereum network as Ether (ETH) prices pass $4,000. Skyrocketing ETH fees have also impacted Ethereum-based USDT, as ERC-20 Tether USDT requires ETH gas fees to complete transactions.\nDespite Celo being an EVM-compatible network, there is no dependency on Ethereum in terms of network fees, according to a source close to Celo. \u201cFor example, if Ethereum fees go up, it doesn\u2019t mean L2 fees, given certain architectural choices, go up in the same way or at all even,\u201d the person noted.\nMagazine: The DeFi bots pumping Solana\u2019s stablecoin volume\nExchange or buy USDT\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

      "article_detailed_content": "Imagine a future where organizations operate not under individuals\u2019 control but by a community\u2019s collective will. Decisions are made collaboratively in an environment where the power is distributed among members, not concentrated in a central authority. This concept, once confined to the realm of science fiction, is now taking shape in the form of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\nDAOs are internet-based organizations fueled by blockchain technology. They function through smart contracts, self-executing code that automates decision-making based on established rules. Ownership and voting rights are often linked to crypto tokens, empowering members to actively shape the DAO\u2019s trajectory. This structure upholds transparency as all transactions and decisions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, accessible for public scrutiny.\nThe challenges around DAOs\nBut as with any disruptive innovation, DAOs come with their own set of challenges, raising a critical question: can they truly revolutionize governance, or are they destined to remain a captivating experiment?\nOne of the most significant challenges facing DAOs is the potential for large tokenholders, known as whales, to influence voting outcomes in their favor. Due to their extensive holdings, whales can manipulate governance outcomes, undermining the collective decision-making process and jeopardizing the fairness and legitimacy of the DAO. According to a research paper, voting power in DAO governance systems is unfair and highly centralized, with fewer than 10 addresses having full control over most DAOs. The study shows that for crypto platforms Compound, Fei and Uniswap, the community delegate vote share is low at about 10% or less.\nThe centralization issue in the voting process is further exacerbated by Sybil attacks, where individuals impersonate multiple voters to skew outcomes using the ease of creating multiple accounts. These attacks can erode trust and hinder the legitimacy of a DAO\u2019s governance.\nWhile some participants in DAOs may be aligned with collective interests and long-term goals, investors will inevitably be driven solely by quick profits, disregarding a project\u2019s sustainability and future. The intrinsic importance of tradeable governance tokens in DAO operations makes aligning financial incentives and community interests challenging, particularly in optimizing a project\u2019s growth potential over time.\nRecognition of diverse contributions\nSecure identity verification measures and a transparent governance system can solve the problems within DAOs. AirDAO, a community-governed layer-1 blockchain, recognizes the solution and aims to make decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible, fair and user-friendly for everyone.\nBuilt on its own blockchain network -AMB-NET- AirDAO offers a product suite to simplify complex financial operations. The suite includes cross-chain bridging to Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain along with a staking platform, a multichain network explorer and FirepotSwap \u2014 a native decentralized exchange (DEX) developed in partnership with Firepot Finance.\nUnderstanding the challenges of governance manipulation and multiple account creation, AirDAO implemented solutions to foster a fairer and more inclusive decision-making process:\nFacial verification: Through a partnership with Fractal ID, a provider of Web3 identity solutions, AirDAO links wallets to users using facial verification technology. The integration enables the creation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that verify identities without requiring the disclosure of personal information or compromising user anonymity. Facial verification reduces the ability to create multiple accounts, ensures each vote is from a unique participant and promotes transparency and accountability.\nThe issuance of the AirDAO\u2019s governance soulbound token (SBT), AMB, is also based on the user\u2019s facial recognition biometric data verified by Fractal ID.\nImpact-based governance: AirDAO\u2019s system rewards users with soulbound tokens (SBTs) based on their contributions to the platform, such as providing liquidity or participating in governance discussions. SBTs determine an individual\u2019s voting power, giving a stronger voice to those who actively contribute to the project\u2019s success.\nAirDAO rewards the community for contributing to its ecosystem with impact-based SBTs. Source: AirDAO\nAirDAO recognizes that its success relies on the contributions of a diverse community. Whether users validate transactions, contribute their skills or champion AirDAO as a Governor or Ambassador, their efforts will be crowned with governance SBTs that reflect users\u2019 benefits to the ecosystem.\nA vision for decentralization\nAirDAO\u2019s Governance Working Group (GWG), comprised of around 30 community members with expertise in various fields, underlines the platform\u2019s commitment to community governance.\nAirDAO\u2019s vision is to complete decentralization and become a fully community-governed project that fosters collective decision-making within the DeFi space. If successful, AirDAO\u2019s potential to address key challenges in DAO governance could pave the way for a more equitable and trustworthy future for DAOs and the wider DeFi ecosystem.\nLearn more about AirDAO Governance Platform\nJoin support Telegram group for AirDAO governors\n#Blockchain\n#Security\n#Decentralization\n#Identity\n#DAO\n#DeFi\nDisclaimer.

It surged 430% five months later, from $11,500 to $61,300 by mid-March 2021.\nIn doing so, it smashed the previous all-time high of $19,665 on Dec. 16, 2017.\nBitcoin\u2019s change in price between May 11, 2020 and March 15, 2021. Source: CoinGecko\nAnalysts have primarily attributed this to spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have caused a radical change in Bitcoin\u2019s supply and demand dynamic, according to Jaran Mellerud, a founder and chief strategist at Hashlab Mining, who recently spoke with Cointelegraph.\nSpot Bitcoin ETF issuers are scooping up 2,450 BTC each day while only 900 BTC are mined, Mellerud noted.\n\u201cThis number will fall to 450 BTC post-halving in late April [where the ETFs will be] sweeping up BTC at a rate five times higher than BTC\u2019s post-halving supply growth. This huge imbalance between supply and demand will lead to a continuous but volatile upward grind of the BTC price.\u201d\nMellerud comments on Bitcoin\u2019s supply and demand imbalance.

Source: Ethereum Research\nThis validation code leverages ERC-4337 account abstraction \u2014 the underlying technology of smart contract wallets \u2014 to prevent private keys from being displayed while signing transactions in the future, rendering these accounts immune from a quantum attack.\nRelated: Ethereum leans into rollup-centric future as Dencun hard fork looms\nAccording to Buterin, users who have never approved a transaction from an Ethereum wallet are \u201calready safe\u201d from any potential quantum-related exploit, as only the wallet address has ever been made publicly available.\nHe also added that the infrastructure needed to implement such as hard fork \u201ccould in principle start to be built tomorrow.\u201d\nThe advent of quantum computing has been a long-feared inflection point for the crypto industry, as a computer capable of breaking blockchain encryption could see once-untouchable user funds stolen in large volumes and at rapid rates.\nHowever, most computer scientists and developers believe that quantum computing is still a ways off, with Google and IBM engineers estimating that quantum computing won\u2019t be sufficiently developed until 2029 at the earliest.\nMagazine: Google to fix diversity-borked Gemini AI, ChatGPT goes insane: AI Eye\nExchange or buy ETH\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

      "article_detailed_content": "Local cryptocurrency stakeholders have lamented the current ban on Binance naira operations in Nigeria, stating it will affect the livelihoods of many Nigerians and could increase youth unemployment in the country.\nIn separate interviews with Cointelegraph, local crypto stakeholders said the delisting of Nigerian naira-related services from Binance will lead to the rise of new crypto exchanges, which will fill the vacuum created by Binance\u2019s exit by complying with local regulations.\nNathaniel Luz, the CEO of Flincap \u2014 a liquidity platform for crypto exchanges \u2014 said that several Nigerian traders who make a living from trading peer-to-peer on Binance are now affected. However, Luz said that some are trading on WhatsApp and Telegram groups.\nAccording to the chief marketing officer of Flincap, Oladotun Wilfred Akangbe, the continuing uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulation in Nigeria and the decision to halt Binance operations can undermine the confidence of many people in the space. He added that it could lead to massive fear, uncertainty and doubt in Nigeria\u2019s crypto space.\nIn an official statement on its website, Binance said it would automatically convert naira balances to Tether (USDT) from March 8 at 8:00 am UTC and cease support for naira deposits from March 5 at 2:00 pm.\nWithdrawals have not been allowed since March 8 at 6:00 am, and the conversion rate is 1 USDT for 1,515.13 naira. Binance\u2019s peer-to-peer platform delisted all naira trading pairs in late February.\nRelated: Binance temporarily suspends Solana network withdrawals, citing \u2018increased volume\u2019\nOn Feb. 27, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria argued that crypto exchanges in Nigeria were suspected of handling illicit transactions, pointing to \u201csuspicious flows\u201d of funds at Binance.\nAs the suspicions of Binance\u2019s alleged illicit operations in Nigeria intensified, the Nigerian House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes called Binance CEO Richard Teng to appear before the committee before March 4.\nIn 2023, Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission stated that Binance Nigeria wasn\u2019t registered or regulated by it, making its operations in Nigeria illegal. In December 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria reversed its stance on crypto assets, advising banks to ignore the previous ban on crypto transactions.\nMagazine: The DeFi bots pumping Solana\u2019s stablecoin volume\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

      "article_detailed_content": "MakerDAO, the organization responsible for the development of the Maker (MKR) token, has approved an \u201cExecutive Vote\u201d to introduce temporary fee adjustments to strengthen the protocol due to heightened market volatility and bullish sentiment resulting in a reduction in reserves for its Dai (DAI) stablecoin.\nThe suggestion comes in response to a rapid decrease in the Dai supply from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the last seven days, as outlined in the proposal from BA Labs, a member of Maker\u2019s Stability Advisory Council.\nScreenshot of MakerDAO executive vote announcement on X. Source: MakerDAO\nIn the proposal, MakerDAO intends to expedite the approval process for a stablecoin stability measure if users choose to redeem a portion of the $1.1 billion in real-world assets (RWA) available on the protocol. Despite Dai being overcollateralized, using RWA vehicles as collateral poses potential liquidity issues if Dai\u2019s selling continues.\n The proposal reads:\n\u201cLiquid stablecoin reserves and reserves deployed to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure generated by the potential bullish market sentiment. The issue lies in the liquidity crunch inherent in the exposure toward stablecoins deployed through RWAs.\u201d \nAlthough Maker DAO\u2019s ecosystem is currently stable, it deems it necessary to anticipate potentially unpredictable user actions. The proposed measures include changes to Maker Vaults, the SparkLend DAI Borrow Rate, the Peg Stability Module (PSM), the Dai Savings Rate and the Governance Security Module (GSM) Pause Delay.\nRelated: Wyoming passes law granting DAOs legal status\nThe adjustments include raising the stability fees on different collateral assets registered on the platform from 15% to 17.25%. In addition, it plans to increase the SparkLend DAI Borrow annual percentage yield from the current 6.7% to 16%. The slate of changes was approved to go into effect from March 10 at 7:55 pm UTC.\nMakerDAO also plans to adjust the PSM to provide a cooldown for debt ceiling increases to drop from 24 to 12 hours. Other measures that will be implemented include incrementing the Dai Savings Rate to 15% and the GSM Pause Delay from 48 hours to 16 hours for swifter implementation of future adjustments.\nWhile these adjustments are temporary, there is no automatic process for reverting the fees. GFX Labs, a blockchain research and development company, expressed on the proposal\u2019s discussion page that the changes were in the right direction but raised concerns about their magnitude, fearing potential market dislocations and disruptions.\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?
