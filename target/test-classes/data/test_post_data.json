[{"article_title":"Latest Ruling on SEC Lawsuit for Gemini and Genesis Earn Program","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Amanda Shinoy"},"article_detailed_content":"Gemini and Genesis were charged with a case by the SEC in the Southern District of New York, and the latest hearing occurred on Wednesday, March 13. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission said that Gemini and Genesis were engaged in the sale of unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program. A federal judge has approved the allegations, enough to bring a company to the witness box. Both firms were allowed to move forward in the latest hearing, but the two defendants\u2019 motions were denied. The SEC Lawsuit On March 13, Edgardo Ramos released the New York District Court ruling. It had released a 32-page detailed order that denied the motions by Genesis and Gemini to dismiss or disapprove of the SEC\u2019s lawsuit. The SEC initiated the lawsuit in January 2023. It claimed that the Gemini Earn program was a cryptocurrency yield-bearing product. Gemini offered the product, and Genesis managed it. Moreover, the product involved the sale and offering of unregistered securities. Edgardo Ramos emphasized that the program wrongly appeared to meet the criteria of an investment contract according to the Howey test. It determines what constitutes security. The test determines the constituents of security. Genesis was especially highlighted for not segregating pooled assets on its balance sheet, and it also lent these funds to institutional borrowers at its discretion. This move made customers\u2019 profit expectations dependent on Genesis\u2019 efforts. Moreover, the court found that it was reasonable to believe that agreements underpinning Gemini\u2019s Earn program could be classified as notes, a type of debt security that mandates the repayment of loans with interest. \u201cAt this stage, under both tests, the court finds that the complaint plausibly alleges that defendants offered and sold unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program,\u201d stated Judge Ramos. The ruling does not guarantee a court judgment in favor of the SEC. Still, it will also allow the regulatory body to proceed with its case, requiring the collection of multiple pieces of evidence. Development in the case The developments in the case follow a backdrop of challenges for Genesis and Gemini, including Genesis\u2019 bankruptcy filing after the SEC\u2019s lawsuit and subsequent agreement to a $21 million settlement with the SEC noted in a bankruptcy court filing the previous month. In November 2022, 340,000 customers and $900 million in assets under management were boasted because of the controversy surrounding the Gemini Earn program. The controversy intensified after FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, which led to market turmoil. This change in market forces led Genesis to halt withdrawals from Gemini Earn, citing liquidity issues. To resolve customer grievances, Gemini agreed in February to return $1.1 Billion to Gemini Earn customers via a settlement in the Genesis bankruptcy proceedings, coordinated with New York\u2019s financial regulator. In May 2023, Gemini and Genisis filed motions to dismiss the case against them. Additionally, subsequent alternative motions to strike the SEC\u2019s request for permanent injunctive relief and disgorgement against both firms. However, both were denied, and it was ruled that the case would be allowed to proceed in the Southern District Court.","article_summary":"Gemini and Genesis were charged with a case by the SEC in the Southern District of New York, and the latest hearing occurred on Wednesday, March 13.

However, amidst this fluctuation, Furrever Token (FURR) stands out with its presale achieving remarkable success, signaling a new chapter in the meme coin landscape. Dogecoin (DOGE) Faces Volatility but Looks Somewhat Resilient Dogecoin (DOGE) has encountered a recent downturn, with its current price hovering around $0.1595, reflecting a 3% decline over the past week. This dip is not uncommon for meme coins like DOGE, which are known for their inherent volatility in the market. Despite this setback, many analysts hold optimistic outlooks for DOGE\u2019s future, particularly as they anticipate a potential resurgence coinciding with the rallying trends of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). As meme coins often experience sharp fluctuations in value, the recent decline in DOGE\u2019s price is not unexpected. Such volatility is inherent to the nature of these assets, characterized by rapid shifts in market sentiment and speculative trading activity. Despite the current downturn, analysts remain hopeful that DOGE will regain momentum once BTC and ETH resume their upward trajectories. This sentiment is rooted in the enduring popularity and strong community support behind DOGE, factors that have historically contributed to its resilience amidst market fluctuations. Looking ahead, investors and analysts alike are keeping a close eye on DOGE\u2019s movements, anticipating potential shifts in response to broader market trends. While short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term outlook for DOGE remains positive, driven by factors such as its widespread adoption and community-driven initiatives. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, DOGE\u2019s ability to weather market volatility and adapt to changing conditions will likely play a crucial role in shaping its future trajectory. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dipped a Bit but Analysts Are Quite Hopeful Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00002883, reflecting a 1% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 15% decline over the past week. As with many meme coins, SHIB\u2019s price volatility is par for the course in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the recent downtrend, SHIB appears to be undergoing a corrective phase, aligning with broader market movements. The minor dip observed in SHIB\u2019s price can be attributed to the temporary pause in the rallying trends of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which have exerted influence over the broader cryptocurrency market. However, analysts maintain a bullish outlook on SHIB\u2019s recovery prospects, citing its resilient nature and strong community support as key factors. While short-term price fluctuations may unsettle some investors, many analysts view them as opportunities to capitalize on buying opportunities. As SHIB corrects its price and navigates the current market conditions, investors are encouraged to consider purchasing the dip and exercising patience. With analysts projecting a potential rebound in the near future, SHIB\u2019s long-term prospects remain promising amidst the broader landscape of meme coins and cryptocurrency assets.

A crypto investment firm, Paradigm, concluded a poll commissioned among a large share of U.S. voters who hold cryptos and are not very happy with the current financial system. The survey was conducted between February 28 and March 4 and presented its results on Thursday, March 14. Donald Trump is the U.S. presidential candidate and is getting favoritism from voters who own cryptocurrencies, as per the data recorded from a poll commissioned by crypto investment firm Paradigm. Details of the Poll Out of the total crypto holders, 48% intend to cast ballots for former President Donald Trump, and 39% posted in favor of current President Joe Biden. Public Opinion Strategies has conducted an online poll, the results of which are shared. The poll indicated a 3.5% margin of error, and the gap could be reversed as undecided voters can decide on either and reverse the expected trend. The poll gathered the opinions of 1,000 voters. Out of the total, 7% of respondents hold more than $1,000 worth of cryptocurrencies, and 19% have purchased some crypto assets. The respondents were asked which political party they believed would be able to tackle the issues surrounding crypto. Some of the voters picked neither. Paradigm\u2019s Justin Slaughter and Dominique Littlle posted a blog entry describing the poll\u2019s results, \u201cLarge numbers of voters are looking for policymakers who can boldly light a path forward on crypto policy.\u201d Looking at the development of other products in the industry, more than 10% of the people who have polled said they have either bought a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) (6%) or are going to (6%). It could further demonstrate that the recent approval of the bitcoin spot ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission is not only drawing the eyes of institutional investors. The presidential election is just a few months away. However, the primaries have already gathered sufficient support to make Biden and Trump the expected nominees of the two most prominent parties. Other polls on the general election show that both of these prominent candidates are running neck to neck. Trump is enjoying a slight edge over other nominees. Why is Trump enjoying a higher edge over other candidates? Trump is getting favored by crypto investors because of his open acceptance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and also for releasing his own collections. Moreover, he has also addressed the growing popularity of Bitcoin. Trump has been addressing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2019. He has taken a clear stance on cryptocurrencies and the regulations surrounding them on his multiple election commissions at various locations. Donald Trump is receiving elevated preference amid the surge in value, trading in its all-time high range. His party is also getting popular as the political party with the most support for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, other political parties are getting less trust from crypto investors for their anti-crypto policies. Trump\u2019s stance against CBDC is also helping it become the favorite choice.","article_summary":"Paradigm has conducted a survey to know who is the preferred presidential candidate among the crypto community.

The social volume chart displays the change in awareness and the popularity of Sandbox crypto among the users. Social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook act as a direct medium for crypto like SAND to spread its reach and popularity among users. The above data shows that Sandbox crypto gained traction among users in December 2023 and January 2024 and witnessed a massive rise in popularity among social media users. However, SAND crypto seemed to lose its social volume in February, which also impacted the price negatively, and it dropped. However, recent data shows a rising curve in the Sandbox crypto social volume in the last week of February and March 2024, which may have a positive impact on the price in the forthcoming sessions. Developers Activity Vs Developers Activity Contributors Count Analysis Furthermore, the development activity reflects the activity level in the form of undergoing projects and developments in the Sandbox crypto. Developers\u2019 activity is increasing, with ongoing developments underway in the SAND asset and the increasing demand for blockchain-based solutions, possibly due to the growing popularity. On Chain- The Transaction Volume Ratio of Sandbox Crypto in Daily Profit to Loss Daily on-chain transaction volume in profit of SAND, loss, and the ratio are metrics that measure the amount and proportion of Sandbox assets that are moved on the blockchain and are either in profit or in loss, contingent on their acquisition cost. The daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss ratio for Sandbox is 0.622<1. Daily On-chain transaction volume in profit(SAND) is \u2013 6.58 Million Daily On-chain transaction volume in loss(SAND) is \u2013 10.59 Million These metrics highlight the following aspects of the Sandbox crypto: Since the volume in loss is high and the ratio is below 1 due to the recent dip observed in the price, it means that most holders might be in a negative position due to the recent dip in price and Sandbox crypto\u2019s sentiment and behavior may be more likely to hold or buy more. Similarly, it highlights that related to its supply dynamics and price pressure on SAND, a higher amount of SAND crypto assets are locked or illiquid, generating upward pressure on the price. In the same way, it also exhibits the trend and momentum of SAND, that the volume in loss is advancing, and the ratio is falling. It illustrates that SAND crypto is facing a correction scenario and is gradually losing momentum as more holders are becoming unprofitable. Total Supply in Profits and Percent of Supply in Profit of Sandbox Evaluation The percentage of Total Supply in profit measures market hype in SAND crypto, which is at 68.511. It measures the percent of total supply in profit earned for a given asset as the ratio between the total supply in profit and the total circulation of the Sandbox asset. Moreover, the total supply in profit is 2.23 billion, and it shows the overall amount of SAND assets bought at a lower price than the current price of Sandbox. Is Sandbox Crypto About to Launch Up to $1.0 Mark? The SAND price structure showed a wonderful rally in its price earlier and made a high of $0.8000. Then, it plunged in recent sessions and showed signs of sustenance by showing the sellers\u2019 rejection at the support level. However, the Sandbox crypto has revealed a sign of sustenance on a crucial level of around $0.6500 on the chart, and the asset is exhibiting bullish strength and rising capacity from the dynamically active support levels, as it holds above major 20-day and 50-day EMA band\u2019s. Furthermore, the SAND crypto asset is showing bullish signs, and it is capable of growing further. It has performed well in the past month and quarter by 42.44% and 31.40%, indicating a solid uptrend. At press time, the Sandbox crypto is experiencing a decline of 2.80% in the last 24 hours. It is currently trading at $0.6650 and has been showing a dip up to the nearest support level. Therefore, if the demand rises from this level, the SAND asset price could bounce back, and the next goal for the price is to reach $1.00, and in-between resistance would be at $0.8000. Another possibility would be that if the SAND crypto price fails to stay above the $0.6500 level, it could decline further. Summary SAND saw increased popularity on social media in December 2023 and January 2024 but experienced a decline in February. The recent uptick in social volume in late February and March 2024 could positively influence its price. Moreover, there\u2019s a rise in development activities for Sandbox, indicating a growing interest in blockchain solutions, which may also affect SAND. SAND had a significant rally, reaching a high of $0.8000 before dropping. It\u2019s showing signs of stability around the $0.6500 support level, with bullish indicators from the 20 and 50-day EMA bands. Therefore, if demand increases, SAND could aim for a rebound to $1.00, with immediate resistance at $0.8000. Conversely, further declines could occur if it fails to maintain the $0.6500 level. This analysis suggests that while SAND is facing some challenges, there is potential for recovery if the positive social and development trends continue.

Avalanche has not stopped rising and has increased by 40% in the last 30 days.

The enigmatic individual has amassed a staggering 52,996 Bitcoin, worth over $3.5 billion, making them the 14th-largest holder of the digital currency. On March 15, the whale purchased at least 1,000 Bitcoin, which accounted for 52% of the total 1,907 BTC bought by the top 10 Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), sparking speculation about the true identity of Mr. 100. Mr. 100 Consistently Receives Bitcoin Interestingly, the wallet associated with Mr. 100 has been consistently receiving Bitcoin since November 2022, around the time of the FTX exchange collapse. What\u2019s more, the wallet has been adding approximately 100 BTC on a daily basis since February 14. Larger Bitcoin transfers from a secondary wallet address have also been observed, with this secondary address accumulating tranches of 100 BTC since 2019. This suggests that Mr. 100 has been accumulating Bitcoin for quite some time. While the exact identity of Mr. 100 remains unknown, several theories have emerged. Some speculate that the whale could be a Hong Kong financial institution pre-seeding for ETFs, the Qatar Investment Authority, other Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds, a cold wallet associated with the South Korean Upbit exchange, or even an unidentified address belonging to a tech billionaire. What sets Mr. 100 apart is their relentless accumulation of Bitcoin, regardless of its price fluctuations. Notably, on March 12, when Bitcoin was trading above the $72,000 mark, Mr. 100 added a staggering 400 BTC to their holdings. This unwavering accumulation spree has propelled them to become the 14th-largest BTC holder, according to data from Bitinfocharts. Does Mr. 100 Wallet Belong to Upbit Exchange? Interestingly, blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence has tagged the Mr. 100 wallet as a cold wallet belonging to the Upbit cryptocurrency exchange. The firm\u2019s analysis suggests that the wallet is associated with a VASP-type service, and the incoming transactions are traced back to Upbit. Crystal Intelligence, another analytics team, confirms that the wallet\u2019s outflows have been directed to an Upbit hot wallet. Most of these transactions involve significant amounts, with some transfers reaching as high as 3,000 BTC. This evidence has led to the hypothesis that Mr. 100 could indeed be linked to Upbit. The movement of 100 BTC at regular intervals may be Upbit\u2019s unique method of managing their cold and hot wallet assets, as suggested by pseudonymous on-chain analyst Defioasis. Furthermore, it has been noted that a South Korean entity has been accumulating large amounts of Bitcoin, adding weight to the theory that Mr. 100\u2019s activities are connected to Upbit. It is worth noting that the US government is the largest holder of Bitcoin (BTC), acquiring approximately 200,000 coins (worth around $5 billion) through seizures related to criminal activities. The digital assets were seized from cybercriminals and darknet markets and are securely stored offline in encrypted hardware wallets controlled by various federal agencies, including the Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

US Senators Urge SEC to Halt Approvals for Crypto ETFs Amid Concerns Two US senators have called on SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to stop endorsing new cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), highlighting the risks of fraud and manipulation especially in cryptos beyond Bitcoin. They emphasize Bitcoin\u2019s relative stability compared to other cryptocurrencies and suggest the SEC\u2019s focus should remain on ensuring investor protection, particularly for those less familiar with the crypto market.

The popularity of Bitcoin ETFs could be impacted by these developments, prompting investors to reconsider their capital allocation in the crypto space, with potential implications for Solana\u2019s market positioning. Solana Price Prediction Solana (SOL/USD)\u2019s pivot point stands at around $188.69 with resistance levels are identified progressively at $201.35, $214.81, and $227.15, indicating potential hurdles in Solana\u2019s upward trajectory. Conversely, support levels situated below the pivot\u2014$170.07, $158.56, and $149.35\u2014outline critical zones that could cushion further declines. Solana Price Prediction The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 74, signaling a potentially overbought condition that might cap further gains in the near term. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $159.00 corroborates the asset\u2019s bullish momentum, highlighting a substantial upward trend. However, a fall below the pivot point of $188.69 could trigger a significant sell-off, targeting lower support levels. In conclusion, Solana exhibits a strong bullish posture above its pivot point of $188.69. The technical setup suggests robust upward momentum, but with caution advised due to the high RSI reading.

The controversy revolves around the auction of an Ethereum NFT featuring the iconic photo of Achi, the dog who became the face of the popular Dogwifhat meme. The saga began when a South Korean Instagram user, claiming to be the owner of Achi, announced their intention to auction an NFT of the original photo that sparked the viral meme. The user, who had consistently posted pictures of Achi wearing various woven outfits over the past five years, revealed their plans to celebrate the dog\u2019s fame. The NFT auction, hosted on the Ethereum NFT platform Foundation, is set to conclude on Monday, with the current bid standing at a staggering 50 ETH, equivalent to over $182,000. Community Hits Against Decision to Partner with Feisty DAO However, the choice to partner with Feisty DAO, an online community experienced in acquiring and fractionalizing Shiba Inu-related NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, sparked a wave of discontent among members of the WIF community and other Solana users. Many expressed their disappointment that Achi\u2019s parents didn\u2019t collaborate with the WIF team on Solana for the NFT drop. @NFDtoken raises Achi to 50 ETH pic.twitter.com/yV6kdTzvws \u2014 Foundation (@foundation) March 15, 2024 The backlash escalated to the point where Achi\u2019s owners felt compelled to publicly address the criticisms. \u201cPlease don\u2019t insult [Achi] and us,\u201d the owners wrote in a pinned comment on the Instagram post. \u201cYou have no reason to blame us. Please cheer for us.\u201d Interestingly, Achi\u2019s owner had previously attempted to work with Solana users, but the experience turned sour. Following the success of WIF, another meme coin called ACHI emerged with the support and endorsement of Achi\u2019s parents. However, the creators of ACHI allegedly abandoned the project shortly after its launch, leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of Achi\u2019s parents. Consequently, they decided to collaborate with Feisty DAO, a proven entity in the NFT space, to ensure a smoother and more secure auction process. Solana Community Made Little Effort to Contact WIF Owners While some members of the WIF community expressed frustration over the lack of coordination between Achi\u2019s parents and the meme coin community, it appears that little effort was made by the community to establish contact with the family behind the dog that propelled their token to a multi-billion dollar valuation. Despite the astronomical success of WIF, Achi\u2019s parents claimed to have never heard from anyone in the WIF community until recently when they attempted to reach out. Mihir, a member of the WIF community involved in the fundraising campaign to display Achi\u2019s face on the LED screen-covered Sphere arena in Las Vegas, admitted that he was unaware of Achi\u2019s owners until last week. However, he acknowledged that they deserved recognition and some share of the spoils generated by WIF, which currently boasts a market capitalization exceeding $3 billion. hi im owner of this dog.

The SOL/BTC pair\u2019s 32.45% climb signifies a growing investor shift towards Solana. Solana gains momentum from meme coin activity, potentially enhancing its market value. The evident shift towards Solana, driven by a quest for alternatives offering stability and innovation, marks a notable confidence boost in its ecosystem. Coupled with the meme coin frenzy within Solana\u2019s platform, these factors contribute to its increasing appeal and potential for further appreciation. Jupiter\u2019s Success on Solana Bolsters DeFi and Meme Coin Ecosystem Jupiter, a prominent DeFi project within the Solana ecosystem, has showcased impressive performance by surpassing Uniswap V3 in data processing volume. Experiencing a 67% increase since March 6, Jupiter\u2019s resilience shines through, especially with the introduction of its Value-Average (Beta) feature. Solana-based Jupiter posts hefty returns amidst meme coin rally \u2013 by @FXstreetNewshttps://t.co/ZGRxxpnzVp #Solana #CryptoCurrencies \u2014 FXStreet Crypto (@FXScrypto) March 15, 2024 This feature\u2019s success illustrates the platform\u2019s robustness, even amid initial price volatility post-launch. Jupiter surpasses Uniswap V3, showcasing Solana\u2019s DeFi prowess. Meme coin launches, like WEN, thrive on Solana\u2019s LFG Launchpad, indicating rising market confidence. Jupiter\u2019s valuation hits $1.27 billion, underlining growing trust in Solana\u2019s ecosystem. The surge in meme coins, including Bonk (BONK) and Dogwifhat (WIF), alongside Jupiter\u2019s achievements, highlight the expanding allure of Solana\u2019s ecosystem. This expansion not only elevates Jupiter but also enhances Solana\u2019s reputation as a burgeoning hub for DeFi and meme coin activities. The escalating trust and investment in projects like Jupiter signal a bright future for Solana, potentially attracting more users and investors, thereby elevating SOL\u2019s value in the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading in the $68,000s, down about 3.5% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), meanwhile, was last down about 4.2% over the same period and trading near $3,700. Both cryptos continue to trade with 30-day gains of over 30%, thanks mostly to huge spot Bitcoin ETF demand. But the ETF buyers were strong enough to hold up the market on Friday. More traders started taking profit in the latter half of the week thanks to the macro backdrop turning into a headwind. The DXY and US yields have pushed up this week as macro traders downsized bets on Fed rate cuts in wake of the latest CPI and PPI inflation figures. Some think that $74,000 may have been the pre-halving peak for Bitcoin. If the blue-chip markets are going to spend the next few weeks consolidating/falling, on-chain shitcoin markets all of a sudden become more attractive. On-chain markets refer to the market for digital assets that have been issued directly on top an existing blockchain. For example, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. These tokens can then be traded on decentralized exchanges, and also perhaps on centralized exchanges if they get big enough. They are often referred to as shitcoin markets because virtually anyone can issue a token at any time. As a result, these on-chain markets are replete with scams and pump-and-dump schemes. Here are a few of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be monitoring. Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXScreener MindAI ($MDAI) An AI shitcoin called MindAI ($MDAI) is up 6,753% in the past 24 hours, as per DEXScreener. That makes it the top crypto gainer today on Ethereum. Its market cap was last around $1.2 million, with just over $250,000 in locked liquidity. Potential investors should be very cautious of this coin though, given five concerning aspects to its smart contract. These include; a modifiable tax, pausable transfers, a 5% buy and sell tax and a whitelist function. COCO ($COCO) A shitcoin called Coco is up 1,800% in the past 24 hours, as per DEXScreener, making it a top crypto gainer today. Its market cap was last $3 million, with $274,000 in locked liquidity. It also has no smart contract issues. But even if the token doesn\u2019t look like a scam, shitcoins are all still very risky. The token is probably still a pump-and-dump scam. There is no such thing as zero risk in the shitcoin market. Crypto Alternatives to Consider Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy. An innocent-looking project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower. A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is getting involved in crypto presales. The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price. These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing. While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales\u2014unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision\u2014savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more. With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market. Here are 14 of the presale projects with the highest potential.

Here are some top performers that traders will be watching and could be the best crypto to buy today. Best Crypto to Buy Today Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter (JUP), Solana\u2019s biggest decentralized exchange, is pumping on Friday, having rallied 23.5% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. The token just hit fresh record highs above $1.2, giving it a market cap of $1.6 billion. It\u2019s fully diluted market cap is $12.17 billion. That\u2019s about $1 billion lower than Uniswap\u2019s fully diluted market cap, the most well-established of the DEXs. For reference, Uniswap\u2019s circulating market cap was last around $7.8 billion. The cryptocurrency hit a market cap $22.6 billion in 2021, so could easily 3x from here. Jupiter, as the Solana ecosystem leader, could see even larger gains. That\u2019s why it ranks as potentially the best crypto to buy today. Conflux (CFX) Conflux (CFX) is one of the top performers today, up 18.5% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. CFX has its sights set on challenging the early 2023 highs in the $0.49 area. If it can break above here, a quick surge towards late-2021 highs around $0.84 is on the cards. The prospect of near-term 2x upside means CFX could easily be the best crypto to buy today. Solana (SOL) In fitting with the pump in the token of its largest DEX, Solana (SOL) is also up big on Friday. SOL was last higher by about 7% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap. Last above $180, SOL is bearing down on its 2021 highs $260 region. Another 50% rally from current levels is easily possible for the token, ranking it as potentially the best crypto to buy today. Crypto Alternatives to Consider All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make solid gains. While the future is always uncertain in crypto, these names could be among the best crypto to buy today. However, those looking for a better probability of near-term gains should consider an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy\u2014getting involved in crypto presales. Presales offer investors a routine to get involved in a project at its very early stages, and thus potentially make returns of as much as 100x. If investors can identify projects with solid foundation, the risk/reward of their investment is very good. Analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time examining new presale projects.

The $5SCAPE token is currently priced at $0.00187 but will eventually list at a 434.76% price premium ($0.01) to this opening Stage 1 presale price. When Stage 1 finishes in two days\u2019 time, the presale price rises by 14.97% to $0.00215 in Stage 2. Eighty percent of the total token supply is available for purchase in the presale. The excitement around the project is shown by the size of the community on social media. 5thScape\u2019s Discord server already has more than 5,400 members, Telegram 16,588, X/Twitter 9,569 and 1,000-plus on its YouTube channel Tokenization to play a major role in the future of VR 5thScape believes that tokenization will play a major role in the future of VR/AR, and its $5SCAPE token is central to its vision. Users will be able to stake $5SCAPE to earn rewards and unlock a wealth of utility-rich features. A dynamic staking pool will be in part funded by player subscriptions and participation in virtual experiences. As more players are onboarded it grows the liquidity pool of the ecosystem to provide the basis for attractive and rewarding annual percentage yield from staking activities.For gamers, $5SCAPE is the universal currency for unlocking products and services in a seamless transactional environment, such as buying and trading in-game assets and access to premium content.On the other hand, for developers $5SCAPE tokens can be earned for building games for the platform and participation in the 5thScape Developer center.The initial product offering includes an impressive array of games, from MMA Cage Contest to soccer VR sporting fun Immersive Kickoff, racing game Thrust Hunter and Archery Master, an adventure game where you follow in the footsteps of a legendary archer. Interested parties can join the waitlist for all the games today. 5thScape chooses Ethereum for its superior technology and vibrant community 5thScape runs on the Ethereum network and will make use of the Skale Network Layer 2 technology to enable the scaling necessary for gaming and other virtual world activities.This is a smart choice. Transaction costs for Layer 2 technologies that run on top of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain are coming down following the Dencun upgrade, so ecosystems like 5thScape\u2019s will be beneficiaries.But with VR there is much more than just gaming. Virtual reality technology provides a platform for commerce that will break down the boundaries between industries and magnify the value potential of each. From movies to education, there are revolutionary opportunities open to those companies and projects that can harness the technology in a way that makes it appealing and accessible for all.The team at 5thScape has thought through how to overcome the barriers to adoption by developing its own hardware and through the innovative use of blockchain-based software. Tokenization plus VR Ultra headset and Swiftscape VR chair set 5thScape apart To work well, virtual reality and augmented reality need great hardware too. So the team at 5thScape will develop the VR Ultra headset and the Swiftscape VR chair in order to maximize comfort and ergonomics to deliver an immersive experience with precise motion tracking and intuitive controls. For all the power and technological innovation (and expense) of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro, much of that can be for naught if the experience of wearing and using the headset is so uncomfortable it limits the engagement with the device and enjoyment.The efforts of Meta in this field have certainly in many ways been pioneering \u2013 or at least the companies it has acquired have been. Meta\u2019s family of Quest headsets has helped to create a bridgehead for VR while Apple\u2019s mixed reality approach has literally opened the eyes of many to the possibilities, if not the wallets. VR is a chance for crypto-native agile tech companies to blossom But neither Meta nor Apple, or the other big tech companies, have shown any inclination to leverage the proven benefits of crypto as the foundation for a trustless economy that facilitates players\u2019 value interactions. That means nimble tech-savvy crypto-first innovators like 5thScape can carve out a niche for themselves and establish a competitive advantage.The funds being raised in the presale will enable the project to complete the development and manufacture of its hardware and build out the decentralized network infrastructure. 5thScape is audited by Coinsult and no major issues have been found with its code. Also, the project is fully KYC\u2019d by SolidProof; the team passed the KYC verification process on January 3, 2024. Also encouraging for potential investors, a link to CEO Anoj Kumar\u2019s LinkedIn is provided on the website, as are those of the rest of the leadership team.An active wallets widget on the homepage shows that there is purchasing activity from countries all over the world, such as Germany, Australia, the United States and Japan, to name a few. $5SPACE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB or card.

This annual observance, established in 1987, emphasizes the profound contributions women have made to society. Diversity Drives Web3 Growth Monica Talán, Founder and Contributor at Spanish-language web3 platform CryptoConexión, told Cryptonews that raising awareness for women in web3 is not just about achieving gender balance. Rather, Talán believes that highlighting women in the web3 sector will expand the field\u2019s talent pool, leading to fresh perspectives and new approaches. \u201cThis will create more equitable economic opportunities, build inclusive communities, and ensure that the future of technology reflects and serves the needs of all,\u201d said Talán. This is critical, as 2023 data suggests that women hold about 26% of all jobs in the crypto industry. Statistics further show that only about 6% of the top leadership roles are held by women, with 94% of CEOs being male. According to Talán, women make up 47% of CryptoConexión\u2019s audience. She explained that by shifting the perspective from \u201cbelieving women must adapt to web3\u201d to \u201cunderstanding that web3 must evolve to embrace women\u201d has helped with the platform\u2019s diversity. Talán explained that CryptoConexión spotlighted 60 Latinas contributing to the web3 sector at the start of Women\u2019s History Month this year. \u201cThis list also included newcomers,\u201d said Talán. \u201cThis effort highlights the importance of representation, aiming to inspire more Latinas to join web3 and create a more inclusive, diverse digital future.\u201d Sandy Carter, COO at web3 domain platform Unstoppable Domains, told Cryptonews that women in the crypto sector have indeed innovated in unique ways. Carter shared that Unstoppable hosted a space on the X platform focused on \u201cthe power of tokenization and women\u201d on March 8 \u2013 International Women\u2019s Day. \u201cWe had guests like Dr Anino Emuwa, who founded 100 Women Davos, and The Africa Women CEO Network,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also had the Director from Boss Beauties who worked on the Mattel Barbie and Boss Beauty NFT project.\u201d Honored to be part of @UnstoppableWow3's initiative to empower women in #Web3 and #AI this International Women's Day.

Kim Currier, Head of Marketing at the Decentraland Foundation, told Cryptonews that from March 26-29, Decentraland will showcase the art of talented women during its second annual \u201cArt Week\u201d and \u201cMESHfair.\u201d \u201cMESHfair is a unique opportunity for artists to explore their creativity in a virtual environment,\u201d said Currier. Currier added that women artists will represent 16 of the 32 international artists selected to show new works during MESHfair. Image of MeshFAIR 2023. Source: MeshFAIR Artist and web3 producer Bay Backner founded MESHfair. Backner told Cryptonews that MESHfair acts as a way to connect artists working in the 3D file format for virtual reality (VR) with galleries and collectors. \u201cDespite widespread interest in VR, works in this format are still underrepresented in both traditional art fairs and influential NFT collections,\u201d said Backner. Backner added that 13.7% of living artists represented by galleries in Europe and North America are women. \u201cOf the 100 most expensive works ever sold, none have been made by a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there is still a long way to go towards gender equality in-real life art.\u201d Unfortunately, Backner believes that a similar gender gap is opening within the VR sector. This may be due to a lack of women-led Metaverse companies. According to McKinsey, only 10% of the virtual world or metaverse companies that gained funding during the 2017-2022 crypto boom were led by women. \u201cSo unless we work on discoverability here \u2013 sharing the work of women entrepreneurs and creatives in VR \u2013 we\u2019ll see the same tired old narratives being repeated,\u201d remarked Backner. With this in mind, Backner explained that MESHfair is important for discoverability. \u201cIt supports the small, but growing community of creators in immersive web3 technology. And every artist in this space right now is making history,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re defining a new artistic medium. It\u2019s therefore especially important that women artists are a documented and discoverable part of this conversation.\u201d A female artist by the name of \u201cJaneDAO\u201d told Cryptonews that displaying her work during MESHfair and Women\u2019s History Month provides a platform to inspire through sharing and creating. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to highlight the diverse creativity and insights women bring to these fields, reinforcing that art communicates universally powerful messages,\u201d she said. \u201cMy involvement not only showcases my contributions but also shines a light on the broader impact of women in this space, sparking important conversations about our shaping role in the future of tech and art.\u201d Image created by JaneDAO. Source: MeshFAIR Women in Web3 Continue to be Highlighted Even as Women\u2019s History Month comes to an end, women-focused initiatives will continue in hopes of encouraging women\u2019s participation in web3. Talán recognizes that the blockchain sector often presents a hurdle for women. She suggests focusing on simplifying web3 concepts and platforms, thus making the sector more approachable, as a key factor in changing the current dynamic. \u201cThe technical jargon, lack of easy-to-use platforms, and fast pace can be intimidating, especially in a field historically dominated by men,\u201d said Talán. \u201cDespite these challenges, significant progress is being made through dedicated ongoing efforts to onboard women into web3.\u201d For example, Talán explained that initiatives like SheFi, Unstoppable Women of web3, HER DAO, Black Women Blockchain Council, and the Association for Women in Crypto are key in demystifying the space. Each of these platforms offers continued education, resources, and community support. \u201cIn Latin America, \u2018WAGMI LATAM\u2019s\u2019 collaboration with communities like Cripto Curiosas, WomenBiz, WEDAO LATAM, WARMI, Mujeres en Crypto and Metagals have shown us the importance of creating local and regional inclusive environments,\u201d added Talán. Backner further noted that she will be hosting upcoming projects geared toward women this year. \u201cMy two upcoming projects are Decentraland Gaming Week (June 2024) which will support diverse creators to build interactive web3 games, and The Censored Art Show (Sept 2024) which will support digital artists impacted by censorship or shadowbanning on social media and other platforms,\u201d she said. Backner pointed out that censorship in particular is an issue that disproportionately affects women and minority digital artists. \u201cThis is especially the case if artists use their own bodies within their works,\u201d she said. Additionally, Carter shared that Unstoppable will continue its commitment to increasing women\u2019s involvement in web3 and tech in general. \u201cWe plan to expand our educational initiatives, offering more workshops, courses, and mentorship programs tailored for women,\u201d she said. \u201cNetworking events and safe spaces for discussions will continue to be a priority, ensuring women feel supported and connected.\u201d The post Web3 Community Celebrates Women\u2019s History Month in The Metaverse and Beyond appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_summary":"March has seen several web3 initiatives to recognize and spotlight women\u2019s achievements in celebration of Women\u2019s History Month.

Formal audits have become something of a blockchain industry standard, though their success at preventing hacks is far from foolproof. With AI, however, there\u2019s no telling whether it will strengthen smart contacts or their attackers the most, and the balance of its benefits may oscillate over time. The absolute volume of stolen DeFi funds dropped from $3.1 billion in 2022 to $1.1 billion in 2023, with the number of incidents also falling from 273 to 172. Using Artificial Intelligence For Romance Scams Beyond its impact on DeFi, artificial intelligence could have worrying implications for romance scams, also known as \u201cpig butchering\u201d scams. These scams begin with seemingly innocent contact, evolving into a fabricated relationship that the scammer then exploits for financial gain. \u201cThat is an area where a large language model that has infinite patience and is quite creative could be used to devastating effect by illicit actors,\u201d Jardine noted. Romance scammers in crypto nearly doubled their revenue last year compared to 2022, despite a decline in total scam volume from $6.5 billion to $4.6 billion. The average size of a romance payment is $4,593, though the average victim likely paid far more since such scams often involve multiple payments. As a share of all crypto transactions, illicit activity fell to just 0.34% of blockchain activity in 2023.

BTC began Friday\u2019s session above $71,000 before selling off sharply during Asian trading session. Having dropped to as low as $65,500 the Bitcoin price abruptly rallied back to $70,500 during US trading hours. It was last trading around $68,000, with leveraged futures positions worth $200 million having been wiped out, as per coinglass.com. This marked the most punishing day for the bulls since March 4, when long positions worth $244 million were liquidated. Since printing fresh record highs near $74,000 on Thursday, Bitcoin has lost bullish momentum. Profit-takers appear to have taken control of the market despite still elevated demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Profits At Absurd Levels, On-Chain Analysis Reveals As per CryptoCon, a 30-day moving average of a widely followed on-chain metric called the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio is at \u201cabsurd\u201d levels. When #Bitcoin profits get high, investors get ancy to sell. ETF inflows don't change that.

But it does suggest that investors sitting on big profits are likely getting \u201cantsy to sell\u201d. At current levels of around $68,000, the Bitcoin price is up over 60% year-to-date. Massive spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have been the main driver of the rally. And they have been accelerating recently. As per a JP Morgan research note, weekly inflows were the largest this week since their January launch. ❖ Bitcoin ETF weekly inflows the largest since launch: JPMorgan In a note covering cryptocurrency markets, JPMorgan said that Bitcoin ETF inflows were at their largest since the launch this week.

That\u2019s despite the cryptocurrency hitting a new all-time before its April halving event, rather than after.

In past Bitcoin bull markets, the price commonly reversed around 30% lower from local highs. As recently as January, Bitcoin dipped from the at the time yearly high of around $49,000 to as low as $38,500. That suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s latest pullback potentially has legs. A retest of $50,000 isn\u2019t out of the question, based on historical comparisons. But ETFs may have changed the game. Major institutional investors entering the Bitcoin market for the first time, with the knowledge of its volatility but also potential upside, are likely to be less price sensitive than past cohorts of Bitcoin investors. They are also likely to have a \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d mentality that may help cushion BTC price declines. Any BTC price dips now may struggle to extend beyond 10-15%. That suggests $60,000 could be a near-term price floor. The Bitcoin Price could dip to the low $60,000s, but could then fly higher towards $100,000. Source: TradingView $74,000 could easily be the pre-halving high. But that could set the stage for a breakout to fresh record levels later in the year and a challenge of $100,000.

In the announcement, the Nasdaq-listed mining company mentioned that the mining plant is in Garden City, Texas. The second quarter of 2024 is the expected date of completion for the deal. Applied Digital Announces $87.3 Million Deal Some stated modifications to the acquisition agreement could see Marathon Digital Holdings pay a gross purchase price of $97.3 million. Applied Digital CEO Wes Cummins stated that this acquisition would bolster and equip the company with more financial resources. He also mentioned that this transaction would strengthen the foundation for long-term expansion and operational superiority. It will ultimately help Applied Digital concentrate on constructing HPC data centers, making it a purposeful pivot. Bloomberg reported that Marathon intends to purchase more mining sites in preparation for Bitcoin\u2019s halving event. The facility was built in 2023. Before this acquisition, Marathon served as a hosting client and had earlier used the site for a hosting agreement. Marathon will remain a hosting client at Applied Digital\u2019s North Dakota data center even after acquiring the Texas facility. Applied Digital also reiterated its commitment to improve and grow its HPC (high-performance computing) potential. The company also announced a collaboration with Together AI earlier this week. The partnership will see Together AI use Applied Digital\u2019s Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) for its operations. Many companies in the Bitcoin mining industry are now diversifying into the generative AI industry. Joining them is the Nasdaq-listed mining company, which is now set to also experiment with generative AI technologies. Marathon Digital\u2019s BitCoin Mining Exploits In late February, Marathon reported a self-mining hash rate of 28.7 exahashes per second (EH/s). With Bitcoin\u2019s next halving scheduled for April 20, the block reward is expected to decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. To strengthen its position for this, Marathon has strategically bolstered its financial resources. As of January 31, Marathon possessed over $1 billion in unrestricted cash and bitcoin combined. Financial projections indicate this will propel the company\u2019s hash rate to a projected 50 EH/s by the end of 2025. Additionally, Marathon has made major moves to expand its mining capacity. In January, the company acquired two mining sites in Nebraska and Texas for approximately $179 million (390 MW). This latest acquisition of Applied Digital\u2019s Texas Bitcoin mining facility further solidifies Marathon\u2019s role as a major player in the digital asset mining industry.

Specifically, Bitcoin\u2019s allocation is 3.7 times greater than that of gold. Additionally, they pointed out a net inflow of $9 billion into Bitcoin ETFs since their inception, which offsets outflows from Grayscale. Crypto Market Surges 40% as Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attract $10 Billion Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director at JPMorgan, revealed in a Friday X post that, when adjusted for volatility, Bitcoin allocation in investor portfolios now exceeds gold by 3.7 times. ❖ Bitcoin has already surpassed gold in investor portfolio allocation: JPMorgan JPMorgan managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said that, when adjusting for volatility, Bitcoin's allocation in investor portfolios has already outpaced that of gold. Specifically, the flagship\u2026 \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) March 15, 2024 The analyst highlighted the accelerated inflows of over $10 billion into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since their approval in January and claimed the potential BTC ETF market size could reach $62 billion, using gold as a benchmark. Another report from JPM Securities predicts that the spot Bitcoin ETF market could expand to as much as $220 billion in the next two to three years, projecting a substantial impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price due to increased capital inflows. The approval of BTC ETFs has already positively affected the crypto market. In the past month, the total market capitalization has soared by nearly 40% to $2.2 trillion. Bitcoin and Ethereum were the primary drivers, increasing by 45% and 47% respectively. Altcoins also benefited, experiencing double-digit gains, alongside further growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a notable increase in net sales, reaching $6.1 billion in February compared to $1.5 billion in January. On top of this, BTC surged by 31% in a month, reaching an all-time high of over $73,800 \u2013 a rise that coincided with inflows into spot BTC ETFs. Crypto mining stocks mirrored this trend, also reaching new record highs in February. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Expected to Grow: Analyst Projections See $62 Billion Market Within 3 Years Early this month, JPMorgan analysts estimated that only 7% ($230 billion) of the $3.3 trillion global investment in gold is held in funds, with the remaining portion stored in bars and coins. Drawing a parallel with the gold market, analysts applied a volatility ratio of 3.7 to project a potential size of $62 billion for the spot BTC ETF market within the next two to three years. This figure, however, might primarily reflect a shift of existing investments from other instruments towards ETFs rather than entirely new capital entering the market. Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs (excluding Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) have already attracted $19 billion in cumulative inflows, representing nearly half of the $36 billion rotational shift anticipated by JPMorgan for the entirety of 2024. Accounting for the $10 billion outflow from GBTC, net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs remain at an impressive $9 billion. Notably, net sales for spot BTC ETFs also saw a significant climb, reaching $6.1 billion in February, compared to $1.5 billion in January. The largest daily inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETFs hit a peak of over $1 billion on March 12, with analysts speculating that this figure could rise further once outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF cease. Bears can't win this game until spot #Bitcoin ETF inflow stops. Last week, spot ETFs saw netflows of +30K BTC. Known entities like exchanges and miners hold around 3M BTC, including 1.5M BTC by US entities.

Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto-analytic firm CryptoQuant, foresees this development as fuel for increased demand. After a prolonged crypto winter lasting nearly three years, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has acted as a catalyst for BTC\u2019s renewed positive price action, propelling it beyond the all-time high of the last bull cycle near $69,000. This has also opened the doors to institutional adoption, led by the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock.

The commission has given big tech an April 3 deadline to provide documents and information to its requests. The European Commission issued the official request to big technological companies including Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Google Search, Bing, Snapchat, and YouTube. European Commission Questions Big Techs over Generative AI\u2019s Hazards According to Bloomberg, this was conveyed in a formal request for information (RFI). The commission asked the companies to provide further information about hazards posed by generative AI. This is because the big tech companies allow users to create and spread content using the technology. The EU is most concerned about the precautions to mitigate the risks of generative AI to election voters, believing that the spread of viral deepfakes and automated service manipulation can impact voters\u2019 perceptions. There is now proposed legislation requiring gen AI companies to share details of their training data in the US, the EU and the UK. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a strong move in the right direction.

This decision follows the EU\u2019s recent e-commerce and online governance regulations \u2014 the Digital Services Act (DSA). This act classified eight platforms as Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs). In this light, it has mandated VLOPs to assess and manage systemic risks in addition to following other outlined guidelines. Meanwhile, election security is another area of concern that the commission is looking into as it seeks answers to the impact of generative AI on election processes. Other concerns include gender-based violence, distribution of illicit content, defense of fundamental rights, minors, as well as mental health. EU Moves Towards Election Security Rules The European Commission has been actively looking into the impact of AI on voters, even as the use of AI increases across all fields. A recent study showed the capacity of AI to spread misinformation among voters, for example. The EU is already counting down to March 27 to finalize election security regulations. The European body has been requesting feedback on election security statutes including by public consultations. This recent RFI to the big tech companies is considered a crucial request that will aid the creation of the EU\u2019s election security policy. Once created, the policy will help combat lingering election security challenges \u2013 including misinformation among voters.

This change in operation became effective on March 15 under Binance\u2019s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, Richard Teng, who assumed the role four months ago. Binance Labs Severs Ties, Maintains Branding A disclaimer announcing the split was published on the website saying, \u201cBinance Labs is an independent venture and not part of the Binance Group nor is it involved in any of the businesses operated by the Binance Group (including but not limited to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange).\u201d Following the effect of this change in operation, personnel at Binance Labs now operate under separate employment agreements from Binance exchange staff. This is in line with the arrangements that are effective at the Binance-backed blockchain network, BNB Chain. In an unexpected move, #Binance has spun off its venture capital arm, Binance Labs, into an independent entity valued at $10 billion. This strategic decision aims to enhance operational efficiency and growth under the leadership of CEO Richard Teng. Despite the separation,\u2026 \u2014 Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) March 15, 2024 Investment Director at Binance Labs, Alex Odagiu noted that they are no longer affiliated with the Binance group as well. He said this while clarifying that the venture capital entity would continue to use the Binance brand under a licensing agreement. Binance Labs has invested in over 250 projects since it launched. There are many companies in its portfolio that have been impacted by this transition into an independent firm. Some are industry giants like PancakeSwap, Polygon, Sky Mavis, and Curve DAO. Aptos Labs, LayerZero, and The Sandbox are some of the other companies involved. In February, Binance Labs invested in Babylon, a Bitcoin staking protocol that introduced the concept of native Bitcoin staking. The investment enables users to stake their Bitcoins on Proof-of-Stake blockchains and earn yields without relying on third-party custody. This bridges services, or token wrapping mechanisms. The unfolding events at Binance have been on the crypto community\u2019s radar since a November settlement with US authorities. The authorities charged Binance $4.3 billion and demanded that founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao step down. Despite its newfound independence, Binance Labs\u2019 core operations are expected to stay unaffected, with an emphasis on finding and investing in promising crypto projects. Venture Capital Trend Among Crypto Exchanges In 2018, Yi He, who heads Binance Labs and co-founded Binance alongside Zhao launched the venture capital division. As a venture capital and incubator, Binance Labs uses funds from the exchange\u2019s profits to back early-stage crypto projects. The splitting of these two entities does not appear to be a cause for major concern within the Binance ecosystem. Binance still holds the largest market share of centralized exchanges (CEXs), accounting for about 50% of global trading volume. The Binance native token, BNB, has experienced a slight decline since the news broke, however. At the time of reporting, BNB was trading at $584.31, representing a decrease of 2.81%. Aside from Binance, popular exchanges in the crypto industry, such as Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken have also established venture capital businesses. Coinbase Ventures was the second-most active investor in the crypto sector in 2023, according to data from PitchBook. Odagiu admitted that in Binance Lab\u2019s case, the transition will not have much impact on the company.

Sponge V1 made its debut during the bear market of May 2023, a fair launch token that instantly captivated meme coin virality due to its nostalgic and catchy namesake. In a dramatic climb, the first SPONGE token exploded to become on of the biggest meme coin launches of the year \u2013 hitting an all-time high market cap of over $100M and generating a community of more than 13,000 holders (and an additional 30,000 followers on social media). Much of these major price gains were fuelled by listings on more than 10 centralized exchanges, including LBank, Toobit, CoinW, BTCEX, Poloniex, MEXC, Gate.io, Bitget, BitKan, and BitMart. And this is why crypto whales are now betting big on SPONGE V2. Sponge V2 was not a traditional launch, to acquire this new token \u2013 early holders had two options \u2013 either buying SPONGE V1 and then staking it through the Sponge website, or, staking already held SPONGE V1. The SPONGE V2 airdrop saw tokens distributed based upon the quantity and length of time V1 tokens were staked. But the hype behind SPONGE V2 doesn\u2019t stop at the network migration it also seeks to deliver Play-to-Earn (P2E) utility to the Sponge ecosystem. SPONGE V2 Play-2-Earn Promise Could Supercharge Ecosystem The Sponge V2 team is developing a bespoke Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, bringing an exciting new utility to the token. Users will have the opportunity to earn $SPONGEV2 tokens by playing the game and ranking on the leaderboard. The game will feature both free and paid versions, allowing users to play for fun or use $SPONGEV2 tokens to purchase game credits for additional in-game earnings. SPONGE V2 Price Analysis: As SPONGE V2 Climbs To $1M Market Cap \u2013 Could It Repeat 100X? At the time of writing, SPONGE V2 is currently trading at a market price of $0.003087 (representing a 24-hour change of -7.14%). This comes as price continues to wrestle with a minor -26% localized retracement move after rising to establish a new early-stage all-time high at $0.004240 on March 9. Now in consolidation, SPONGE V2 has established a well-defended lower support zone between $0.0027 and $0.0031 over the past week \u2013 priming price action for its next leg-up. Upside movements are now targeting a pushback above higher supper at $0.00365 as buy-pressure remains dominant over the past 24-hours representing 59% of transactions. Overall, price analysis leaves SPONGE V2 in a bullish ascendant trading channel in the weekend, with price primed for a bounce ahead of major exchange listings following a successful consolidation. Still representing a fantastic entry at $1.1m \u2013 if crypto whales are right \u2013 this project could undertake as much as a 100x return from current levels (based on historical market caps). The Bottom Line As Sponge V2 heads towards major exchange listings, crypto whales are rushing to accumulate in anticipation of major gains, bringing a new chapter to the already remarkable history of SPONGE token. The team\u2019s commitment to utility, staking, and a P2E game makes Sponge V2 a project to watch closely.

As yet, there is no substantial evidence tying the Emir of Qatar or the state\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), to a giant Bitcoin investment, although rumors have tended that way since December. Still, there are only a few explanations for the mysterious case of the \u201cMr 100,\u201d and in any case, one thing is clear: there is some hefty whale movement around Bitcoin between the successful launch of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January and the upcoming halving on April 19, a quadrennial event that halves miners\u2019 Bitcoin revenue and thereby the new supply.

Broadly speaking, all leading meme coins share the same fate today, with market leaders Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and PEPE posting similar losses. Crypto\u2019s novelty coin sector is bearing the brunt of a broader market downturn that has today shaved 6% from market leader Bitcoin (BTC) which was trading at all-time highs earlier yesterday, but now sells at $68,118. Nearest contender Ethereum (ETH) also shed 5% overnight and changes hands at $3,711.54. Crypto has been doing well for most of the year-to-date off the back of hype around 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs the SEC approved for trading on January 10. The ETFs have been very successful. So far they have collectively netted $12 billion, helping Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $73,737.94 yesterday. On Tuesday, the ETFs took in $1 billion in inflows, with BlackRock\u2019s accounting for the $848 million bulk of it. However the release that day of last month\u2019s hot US inflation readings appear to have dampened enthusiasm for riskier assets this weekend. Over on WIF\u2019s trading chart we can see a gradual rally from the end of February that starts to get volatile around a week into March. The sudden upward momentum on Tuesday March 12 was very bullish but it fizzled out by Thursday. Given WIF\u2019s Relative Strength Index (RSI) of about 50, it\u2019s not likely to decline unless Bitcoin does. In any case, WIF will find strong support at $2. Source: TradingView WIF Memes Offer Less Utility Than VR Gaming Tokens WIF is pure meme stock, which makes it a volatile allocation for any portfolio. Meme coins are highly whimsical in nature and their pricing often exaggerates market trends. For instance, when Bitcoin was rallying last week, meme coins were rallying even harder. Today, when Bitcoin and Ethereum are posting losses, leading meme coins are posting heavier ones. Investors who want to support the altcoin sector should really limit their exposure to altcoins. Since their value is dictated by their viral appeal and trendiness rather than their underlying protocol, a sudden loss of interest could be disastrous for holders. Blockchain proponents believe that the future of gaming will incorporate blockchain tech to handle and record payments. Not only will blockchain be more integrated in gaming, it will also be more present in the wider web. Advocates of the idea refer to this iteration of the internet as Web 3. Another technology that will drive future innovations in gaming and the web is virtual reality (VR). With that in mind, it would seem that the crypto projects that are most ahead of the curve are VR gaming projects like 5th Scape ($5SCAPE).

Our upcoming article focuses on top altcoins and their potential to revolutionize finance.

BlastUP Presale: A Beacon of Predictability in the Volatile Crypto Space Buying presale tokens may be a good idea, as they are immune to market\u2019s wild swings with their price pinned to a certain level.

Currently, the token\u2019s price is 45% lower than its future listing price, so now is the most opportune moment to join the presale. >> Don\u2019t Miss Out!

Supply of BlastUP Tokens is Limited \u2013 Secure Your Spot in the BlastUP Launch! << NEAR Protocol Token\u2019s Strong Performance Opens Bullish and Bearish Scenarios The recent remarkable performance of the NEAR Protocol token presents intriguing possibilities. Given the rising trajectory, a bullish scenario could possibly see it pushing past the $9.11 resistance to peak higher. The AI conference tie-in suggests strong potential for sustained upward movement. However, market volatility remains an ever-present risk, especially if enthusiasm wanes post-conference. On a more conservative note, the current market price of $7.16 is robust but there is potential for fallbacks. NEAR might find itself testing its nearest support level at $2.97 if bearish trends kick in. Long-term, the 100-day simple moving average of $3.60 indicates a stable middle ground, highlighting the resilience of NEAR even amid fickle market fluctuations. Optimism Price Analysis: Possible Price Rebounds and Risks Optimism is currently trading at $3.70 with nearby support and resistance levels at $2.95 and $4.32 respectively. The Possible adoption of the Arbitrum upgrade potentially positions Optimism for swift rebounds. A strategic break above the nearest resistance level might project a rally towards the second resistance level at $4.95. The 10-day moving average points to $4.42 as another plausible target in the short term. On the other hand, observing the 100-day moving average at $3.41, we can gather that Optimism has been consolidating around this region. The somewhat neutral stance across the RSI and Stochastic RSI Fast indicators, alongside the MACD\u2019s sell recommendation, hints at wavering momentum. Thus, potential hindrances in the upcoming Dencun upgrade could lead to the price retesting lower support levels. The first potential drop targets could be around the nearest support at $2.95 and then possibly at $2.20 if the bearish environment persists. Conclusion In conclusion, while NEAR Protocol and Optimism show noteworthy potential, BlastUP emerges as a uniquely promising initiative. Its concept as the first launchpad on the Blast ecosystem and subsequent success are strong indicators of its potential. The significantly high funding and growing community emphasizes the support and belief in its mission. Although all altcoins offer investment opportunities, BlastUP\u2019s strategic growth sets it apart as an altcoin with substantial prospective impact on the future of digital finance.

The Buzz Explained","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Guest User"},"article_detailed_content":"The upcoming NFTFN presale has the community watching closely. This isn\u2019t just about another NFT project entering the space; it\u2019s about a platform set to address enduring challenges in the NFT market. With a proposed solution that leverages the mechanics of traditional finance in a decentralized environment, NFTFN\u2019s presale is drawing attention not for its hype but for the potential solutions it offers to real issues faced by traders and collectors alike. The NFTFN Proposition NFTFN\u2019s foundation is its order-book-based NFT Perpetual Decentralized Exchange, or DEX. Traditional exchanges utilize order books, lists of open buy and sell orders at various price points, offering transparency and price discovery mechanisms that are currently lacking in the NFT space. By applying this model to NFT trading, NFTFN promises to provide a clear view of market demand and price trends, a significant departure from the opaqueness typically associated with NFT markets. Solving the Market\u2019s Pain Points The NFT market, while burgeoning, is not without its entry barriers. High-value NFT collections often come with a steep price tag, locking out average investors. NFTFN tackles this by introducing an NFT floor-price index through its SuperNova (SNV) product, granting exposure to Blue-Chip NFT collections without the need to manage individual assets. This index allows for hedging, a common practice in other asset classes to manage risk, which has been notably absent in the NFT space until now. >> Be Among the FIRST! Get the Exclusive Perks From NFTFN Presale << Core Features NFTFN\u2019s approach integrates the following key features: Synthetic Exposure: By providing synthetic exposure to Blue-Chip NFTs, it allows investors to speculate on the value of high-end collections without owning the actual NFTs. Leverage and Margin Trading: Traders can utilize up to 10x leverage, amplifying their trading capital and potential returns. Diversification: The platform\u2019s indexes offer a diversified investment in multiple NFTs, spreading risk and reducing the impact of volatility. Transparency: With an order-book system, all bids and offers are visible, bringing a level of transparency to the NFT market that more closely aligns with traditional financial exchanges. Accessibility: NFTFN lowers the entry barrier to investing in top-tier NFTs, making the market more inclusive. How It Works The functionality of NFTFN relies on the NFT floor-price index, where traders can long or short based on their market predictions. The order-book DEX ensures that traders have a real-time view of the market, enabling informed decision-making. Moreover, the introduction of funding payments helps keep the index price in alignment with the market price, which is crucial for maintaining market stability. Backed by Industry Players A project\u2019s credibility is often underscored by the caliber of its backers. NFTFN has secured the confidence of notable industry partners such as Google (Cloud Partner), Opensea, BitsCrunch, NFT Bank (Pricing Partners), WOW Earn (Wallets), Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon (Blockchain Partners). These partnerships are not only a vote of confidence but also bring substantial expertise and resources to the platform. Conclusion As the presale looms, the anticipation is palpable. What sets NFTFN apart is its pragmatic approach to enriching the NFT ecosystem with proven financial mechanisms. It doesn\u2019t rely on hyperbole; instead, it brings a thoughtful solution to the table. The success of the presale will ultimately depend on market sentiment, but with its unique proposition and strong backing, NFTFN is poised to be a notable event in the NFT market. About NFTFN NFTFN is the go-to platform for perpetual trading of diverse assets like Blue-Chip NFTs, Crypto, and Real-World Assets. With a minimum investment of just $10, users can easily take long or short positions on their chosen asset class, catering to traders of all levels.

Many investors are on the lookout for alternative cryptocurrencies with the potential to generate exponential returns soon. When it comes to cryptocurrency, one thing is certain: meme coins are king! Seven of the top ten best-performing cryptocurrencies for a month in a row have been meme coins and BEFE is one of them. The growing cryptocurrency BEFE coin is getting a lot of attention, and some are predicting that an investment as small as $100 may produce a million dollars during the upcoming bull market. This is happening at the same time as interest in meme currencies is on the rise, since they give people a way to be successful that doesn\u2019t require working for someone else. Rolling the BEFE Price Dice BEFE\u2019s market performance has been phenomenal. The price of BEFE is $0.0004932 right now, March 15, 2024, and has dropped by 4.4% in the last 24 hours. This is the perfect time to buy the dip. Also, the coin has gained 17.03% in value over the last 30 days, and it\u2019s expected to hit new highs soon.

Right now, the plan is pretty easy to understand. It looks like a strong upward trend based on its technical charts and RSI values.

Now is the time to turn your spare change into crypto wealth with BEFE.

This change aligns with Vision 2030, aiming to meet the job market\u2019s demands. A recent report by Colliers, a global professional services firm, sheds light on this significant shift. The Kingdom is setting its sights on industries like artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and tourism. It\u2019s an indication of a new era of economic diversification and job creation for Saudi nationals. Education and market needs The job space in Saudi Arabia is driven by the Kingdom\u2019s strategic push towards Saudization and economic diversification. Traditional degrees are making way for specialized fields such as robotic sciences and nuclear energy. Colliers highlights a growing need for higher education institutions to adapt to these market changes. As the country invests heavily in tourism, creating thousands of jobs, the education sector must advance to supply skilled professionals. This transition aims to bridge the current gap between graduates\u2019 skills and the real-world requirements of employers. With nearly 2 million Saudis enrolled in higher education, the focus is now on steering students towards sectors with high job potential. Despite the high enrollment, there\u2019s a noticeable misalignment with market needs. This is noticed in fields like hospitality and renewable energy. The government\u2019s Saudization initiative mandates increasing the percentage of the Saudi workforce in tourism. This is due to a push to host 130 million tourists annually by 2030. Efforts are underway to establish dedicated hospitality academies and introduce tourism-related programs in universities. This educational change is not just about creating jobs but ensuring that Saudis are well-prepared to excel in these roles. Saudi Arabia expands education The transition also opens doors for the private sector to play a larger role in education. It\u2019s encouraging the establishment of branch campuses of international universities in Saudi Arabia. This move balances public and private educational offerings. All Saudis will have a variety of educational options, regardless of their financial background. Having a transparent and stable regulatory environment is crucial for attracting private investment in the education sector, ensuring quality education for all.

Ordinals Price History ORDI, the first-ever BRC-20 token, debuted on the Bitcoin network, marking a significant moment in cryptocurrency history. This event highlighted the innovative Ordinals Protocol, developed by software engineer Casey Rodarmor in early 2023. Binance, a major cryptocurrency exchange, added Ordinals (ORDI) to its listings on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there was widespread confusion, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding played a role in ORDI\u2019s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. According to Coinmarketcap, ORDI\u2019s journey began in May 2023, with an initial trading price of $25.3466. Following this, the coin experienced a downturn, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI\u2019s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. The coin peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17.

This capability has paved the way for a new realm of digital assets, such as NFTs, to flourish directly on the Bitcoin network. ORDI vs the Ordinals Protocol ORDI and the Ordinals Protocol, while sharing the Bitcoin blockchain as their platform, serve distinct purposes and are underpinned by different technological foundations. The Ordinals Protocol enhances satoshis with multifaceted data embedding capabilities, transforming them into versatile digital assets. In contrast, the ORDI token represents a unique digital asset within this enriched environment, aligning with the BRC-20 Token Standard. This interplay has sparked renewed interest in Bitcoin\u2019s potential beyond its conventional role. ORDI\u2019s Unique Appeal The rapid rise in ORDI\u2019s popularity can be attributed to its novel approach and distinct features. It notably expands the spectrum of digital assets on the Bitcoin network by enabling the transformation of text and visuals into NFTs and tokens. However, as a newcomer in the digital currency sphere, ORDI navigates challenges such as market volatility and the necessity for advanced support infrastructure. Mirroring Bitcoin\u2019s capped supply, ORDI maintains a limited supply of 21 million tokens. Its acquisition process is designed for easy access, requiring basic digital tools, identification, and a payment method. Major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and OKX, have embraced ORDI, enhancing its reach and accessibility. Conclusion According to various predictions, the Ordinals (ORDI) token outlook from 2024 to 2033 is quite optimistic. By 2027, the ORDI is projected to attain a maximum value of $368.63, with its lowest expected price being $313.97 and an average trading price hovering around $325.05. Looking further ahead to 2033, an even more ambitious forecast suggests that ORDI could reach a maximum of $3774, maintaining a minimum price of $3216 and averaging approximately $3305. These predictions indicate a strong growth potential for the Ordinals token over the coming decade. However, it\u2019s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and unpredictable, so these forecasts should be viewed cautiously and balanced against wider market trends and expert analyses. Note that the predictions are not investment advice; seek independent professional consultation for investments.","article_summary":"Ordinals Price Prediction 2024-2033 In the swiftly evolving landscape of blockchain technology, the Ordinals protocol has carved out a unique niche, sparking widespread interest and speculation about its future market performance.

If a wallet has a single component that\u2014when lost or stolen\u2014can lead to a permanent loss of funds, then it\u2019s simply too dangerous to consider. Nobody wants to keep significant wealth teetering on the edge of catastrophe. Individual bitcoin holders have numerous tools available that can help reduce the risk of loss or theft. In a previous article, we covered some of these tools, highlighting modifications commonly applied to singlesig wallets. However, we also explained why these approaches fall short of removing single points of failure entirely. For a business, government, or other institution that wants to secure a bitcoin treasury, eliminating single points of failure is not just a nice-to-have, but a prerequisite. The only custody models worth considering for these entities are ones that include a threshold requirement in order to access funds. A threshold requirement describes a structure that involves multiple, separately secured components, where a subset of those components are needed to approve any withdrawal. This is the only way of achieving institutional-grade security, with single points of failure eliminated completely. In this article, we\u2019ll cover how to apply threshold security using three different methods: script multisig, Shamir\u2019s secret sharing (SSS), and multi-party computation (MPC). We\u2019ll also dive into the tradeoffs associated with each approach, and how an institution can choose the best setup to meet their needs.

If you aren\u2019t sure what script multisig is, we recommend checking out our earlier article dedicated to explaining how multisig wallets work and what they\u2019re used for. As a quick review, a multisignature wallet involves multiple private keys, and can be configured so that a specific number (threshold) of those private keys are required to sign any transaction. The signatures can be produced at different times and locations, allowing each key to remain physically separated. Once a threshold number of signatures have been produced, they can be combined into a single bitcoin transaction capable of spending the funds. A 2-of-3 script multisig quorum, where a threshold of two unique signatures from two keys are required for withdrawals. This relatively simple way of creating a threshold requirement is highly effective at removing all single points of failure. As long as the spending threshold is greater than one but less than the total number of keys, then any single key can become lost, stolen or destroyed without bitcoin becoming unrecoverable. The remaining keys could sign a recovery transaction moving funds to a fresh multisig setup. Satoshi Nakamoto laid the groundwork for multisig when bitcoin was first released, anticipating that it could be a popular mechanism for securing funds. However, it wasn\u2019t until the P2SH softfork in 2012 that multisig started to become a widely used tool. Multisig has since proven itself as a battle-tested security model for more than a decade, across several different address types. What is Shamir\u2019s secret sharing? Shamir\u2019s secret sharing (SSS) is a secret sharing algorithm that was developed by renowned cryptographer Adi Shamir in 1979. It can be used as another way of introducing a threshold requirement for protecting bitcoin. SSS allows users to split a key into several distributed \u201cshares,\u201d with only a certain threshold of the shares needed to reassemble the key. This can be used to design quorums like 2-of-3 or 3-of-5, similar to multisig. A 2-of-3 SSS arrangement, where any two shares, represented by the colored shapes, can reassemble the key to a singlesig wallet. The key can produce the single signature needed to withdraw funds. However, this approach still leads to single points of failure at certain instances during its lifecycle. One example is when the key is initially split up into SSS shares. This operation is usually done on a single device at a single time and place. If an attacker compromises that device, the key generation process or the share creation process, they\u2019ve compromised the key. Another example is whenever the user needs to reassemble the key to sign a transaction. A threshold number of shares must be brought together, once again on a single device at a single time and place, which an attacker could exploit. A fairly simple and widely used method of implementing SSS technology for cryptocurrency custody is through the Shamir backup, developed by Satoshi Labs in 2017. It can be found as an option in certain Trezor hardware wallet models.

MPC, or multi-party computation, is a subfield of cryptography that traces back to the 1970s. The goal of MPC is to allow multiple participants to jointly perform a computation, while each participant\u2019s contribution to the computation is not revealed to the rest of the group and therefore can remain private. This allows for multiple parties to collaborate in various contexts without needing to trust each other. When applied to bitcoin custody, MPC involves distributed \u201cshares,\u201d similar to SSS. However, unlike SSS, the shares are not split from a private key nor used to rebuild a private key. Instead, multiple parties compute a single signature directly from a threshold of their shares. A 2-of-3 MPC arrangement, where any two shares, represented by the colored shapes, can produce a signature directly without assembling a key first. Unlike SSS, MPC does not necessitate a single point of failure. MPC shares can be generated separately from one another, and they never need to be brought together to operate the wallet. Information produced from a share can be communicated to the other participants, without the share itself being revealed. Since bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have primarily used a signature system based on ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), MPC had to be adapted for this context. The first practical threshold protocols for ECDSA were published in 2018. [GG18, LNR18] What are the trade-offs between threshold models? With three different threshold security models to choose from, the next step is understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each option. Tradeoffs with multisig Script multisig is a standardized way of achieving threshold security, native to the bitcoin protocol. The structure is considered relatively simple and robust. The barrier to entry is also small\u2014if a bitcoin user knows how to operate a singlesig wallet, then it\u2019s not a large leap to learn how to set up and use a multisig wallet. When a multisig wallet is initialized, the addresses produced for receiving bitcoin into the wallet have the threshold requirement built into them. Once a multisig address has been funded, the bitcoin is protected by an immutable contract that has essentially been written into the blockchain itself. The only way to alter the contract (such as changing the access control policy, adjusting which keys are protecting the bitcoin) is to move the bitcoin to a new address that was built with a different contract. For multiple parties who are collaborating to secure bitcoin, this ground-level immutable contract mechanism can provide the highest degree of reassurance that the money is secured according to how all parties have intended. If anything were to be fundamentally changed, it would become obvious to everyone by the occurrence of a public transaction, and the keys that approved the change would be known. This is why collaborative custody providers such as Unchained rely on script multisig for our products. However, deploying contracts publicly on the blockchain comes with tradeoffs. As bitcoin is spent out of a multisig address, the access control policy for that address must be permanently published on the blockchain. Observers can then see the details of the multisig quorum that was being used. Although the remaining funds can be easily migrated to a new address going forward, the fact that past security arrangements are exposed isn\u2019t ideal. Additionally, needing to move bitcoin from one address to another in order to adjust the access control policy means that transaction fees are always involved with the process (and the larger the quorum, the more expensive it will be). For entities that value custodying altcoins, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, script multisig can pose more of a challenge than the other two methods of threshold security. This is because a multisig threshold quorum is imposed on the blockchain level, and different cryptocurrencies use different blockchains. Many cryptocurrencies don\u2019t even support a native, robust multisig implementation at all. Meanwhile, SSS and MPC enforce threshold quorums at the key level, and look like singlesig transactions publicly. Since almost all cryptocurrencies support a similar standard for singlesig custody (the same key can be used across most cryptocurrencies), this allows SSS and MPC to be more cross-chain compatible. Tradeoffs with Shamir\u2019s secret sharing SSS offers another way of designing a threshold requirement based on relatively simple and battle-tested cryptography. For the purposes of cryptocurrency custody, SSS also has a widely deployed method with a low barrier to entry (Shamir backup). Once someone has experience using a conventional singlesig wallet, it isn\u2019t a huge leap to use a Trezor to set up a wallet with a Shamir backup. Unlike multisig, SSS operates completely outside of public-facing addresses and transactions on the blockchain. Instead, the threshold requirement is decided by how the private key is split into shares. This means that splitting a key into shares and later reassembling them can be done in private, so that only the people participating in the bitcoin custody arrangement are aware that SSS is being used. In addition to privacy advantages, keeping the threshold structure outside of the blockchain also means that SSS transactions won\u2019t lead to increased fees, and it can be used to secure many different cryptocurrencies. Although most cryptocurrencies have their own unique blockchains, they can all share the same private key as an access point, and that key can in turn be split up using SSS. The biggest disadvantage to SSS has already been mentioned above\u2014the private key must exist in one place at one time, before it is first split into shares, and also when the shares are recombined for the purposes of approving a withdrawal. These vulnerabilities create temporary single points of failure, meaning that SSS by itself doesn\u2019t offer truly institutional-grade security, unlike multisig or MPC. Additionally, SSS doesn\u2019t natively offer a method for adjusting the access control policy. Once a private key is split into a quorum of shares, those shares will always maintain the ability to reproduce that key. If a group is securing a treasury together using SSS and a member of the group leaves, revoking permissions for that individual in a secure manner can pose a challenge. Remaining members of the group could reassemble the key and then split it into new shares, but the old shares would need to be verifiably destroyed. Otherwise, the funds would need to be sent to an entirely new wallet protected by a different key. Tradeoffs with MPC Much like SSS, MPC enforces the threshold requirement at the key-level instead of the blockchain-level. This unlocks similar advantages, such as granting a higher capacity for privacy, avoiding increased transaction fees, and allowing for one MPC custody structure to be used across many different cryptocurrencies. Importantly, MPC manages to avoid the temporary single points of failure that come with using SSS. By using a different cryptographic method, the key shares can exist separately from the moment the wallet is first created, and even remain separate while signing withdrawal transactions. Most MPC implementations also include a native method of adjusting the access control policy (creating a new quorum of shares) without having to send funds to a new wallet address. However, MPC for threshold ECDSA is considered very complex cryptography, and there is not an agreed-upon standard for using it. There are many different protocols, with the first two being developed independently in 2018 by Gennaro and Goldfeder [GG18] and Lindell et al. [LNR18]. Since then, we\u2019ve also seen protocols from Doerner et al. [DKLs19], Castagnos et al. [CCL+20], Damgård et al. [DJM+20], Canetti et al. [CMP20], Gągol et al. [GKSS20], Gennaro and Goldfeder [GG20], Canetti et al. [CGG+21], Abram et al. [ANO+21], Doerner et al. [DKLs23], and perhaps others. While the newer protocols tend to make certain improvements upon the older ones, they may have had less opportunity for peer-review, audit, and other testing. The higher level of complexity involved with MPC creates a widened attack surface. With additional components and procedures, there is more room for error and potential security vulnerabilities. Evidence of serious security flaws, including full private key extraction attacks, has already presented itself more than once, affecting some of the threshold ECDSA protocols listed above. Examples include: AS20 vulnerabilities, September 2020, affecting GG18 implementations Alpha-Rays vulnerabilities, December 2021, affecting GG18 and GG20 TSSHOCK vulnerabilities, August 2023, affecting GG18, GG20, and CGG+21 BitForge vulnerabilities, August 2023, affecting GG18 and GG20 \u201cCryptography needs to pass the test of time to attain longevity, and these new protocols clearly didn\u2019t pass the test of time[\u2026] this research was not ready for implementation or widespread adoption. From my perspective, implementing and productizing such recent research is quite dangerous.\u201d \u2014 Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet, December 2021 response to Alpha-Rays \u200d\u201c[MPC is] more complicated, more to get wrong. Advanced crypto protocols are fragile in the detail and in the implementation. I'd feel more confident in multisig, which is super simple and rock solid.\u201d \u2014 Post by renowned cryptographer Adam Back, January 2023 MPC is also limited by who can realistically use it in the first place. As previously mentioned, threshold ECDSA is very complicated. For the average individual, there are no tools available to safely or easily set up MPC independently. While some businesses offer collaborative custody MPC wallets that are fairly easy to use, those businesses offer no easy way for users to recover funds if the business disappears (or no way at all, in which case they are a single point of failure). Because script multisig is a simple and open standard, businesses who provide collaborative custody solutions using multisig can offer open-source and easy-to-use recovery tools. This creates a straightforward avenue for clients to recover their funds even if the collaborative multisig business were no longer available to assist. Which model is best? As we just covered, there are numerous tradeoffs between using multisig, SSS, and MPC. They can be arranged in a chart for a visual comparison: This chart demonstrates the strengths (blue) and weaknesses (red) for each method of implementing threshold security. Gray could be a strength or weakness depending on one\u2019s perspective. If a business specializes in the custody of many different cryptocurrencies, they might be motivated to hire a team of professionals to carefully set up an MPC custody model. However, if a business or individual were looking for a simple and reliable way to secure bitcoin for the long term, using script multisig and accepting the privacy tradeoffs might be preferable. SSS is rarely used by itself due to its inability to enforce institutional-grade threshold requirements at all times. Combining models for collaborative custody While multisig, SSS, and MPC are often thought of as competing security models, it\u2019s possible to incorporate more than one of them into an overall custody structure. As previously described, SSS and MPC allow a threshold of key shares to produce a signature for a transaction. If the signature was for spending funds out of a singlesig wallet, then nothing else would be required to complete the transaction. However, if instead the signature was for spending funds out of a multisig wallet, additional signatures from other keys could also be needed. A 2-of-3 multisig structure, where one possible signature could be produced from a normal key, another possible signature could be produced from a key that is reassembled from 2-of-3 SSS shares, and another possible signature could be produced directly from 2-of-3 MPC shares. While this combination of techniques may sound unnecessary and cumbersome, there are indeed some contexts where it makes practical sense. With the rise in popularity of key agents and multi-institution custody, there is a growing number of specialty businesses that are commissioned by individuals and institutions to secure one of the keys to a multisig wallet. These distributed key agents can help reduce custodial risk. But how should a key agent secure that single key which they are responsible for? SSS or MPC can be a strategy to minimize or remove single points of failure from this duty. A corporate key agent can design a system where several different officers within the business each hold key shares, and therefore a signature can only be produced upon agreement from a threshold of those officers. Additionally, if an attack were to occur during an SSS reassembly, or an MPC implementation ends up suffering from a new key extraction vulnerability like the ones listed earlier, then no customer funds are immediately at risk. The key agent would have time to react and address the issue, while the bitcoin remains protected by the broader multisig wallet. Using script multisig to create a threshold requirement as a foundational immutable contract, and then commissioning professional key agents to each protect a multisig key using their own SSS or MPC threshold, is far and away the safest method for an institution to keep bitcoin secured for the long-term. New capabilities with Taproot In November of 2021, the Taproot soft-fork occurred, adding new tools into the bitcoin ecosystem. Some of these tools impact the future of institutional-grade bitcoin custody, by allowing for certain improvements and optionalities. Schnorr signatures: The Schnorr signature algorithm is now available in bitcoin as an alternative to ECDSA. Using MPC on top of Schnorr leads to threshold security schemes that are far less complicated, and therefore also provide higher confidence in their security, compared to the ECDSA protocols mentioned earlier. FROST is the leading Schnorr threshold signature protocol, while MuSig2 is also available specifically for N-of-N quorums. Both of these signature schemes are on the path to becoming standardized tools across the bitcoin industry, and they are expected to make MPC available for regular individuals, with a user experience similar to script multisig. Script type privacy: Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) addresses are a new address type that allow script multisig bitcoin addresses to appear identical to the addresses being used for singlesig wallets. This provides a significant privacy improvement, because it means that the bitcoin address itself doesn\u2019t provide any clues about its owner\u2019s security model, such as whether or not they might be using script multisig. Multiple spending paths: P2TR addresses also have the ability to contain multiple spending paths built into them. This can create new ways of structuring threshold security for institutional-grade custody, as described in BIP 342 (rationale, section 5). For example, a user could create an N-of-N script multisig spending path for every combination of keys that can spend funds. Rather than build a 2-of-3 quorum with keys A, B, and C, a similar outcome can be achieved with three separate 2-of-2 quorums as possible spending paths\u2014one with keys A and B, one with keys A and C, and one with keys B and C. This strategy can increase privacy, because only the spending path that ends up getting used will be revealed. A similar concept can be applied to MPC key share quorums, allowing MuSig2 to be utilized for thresholds. These Taproot tools are relatively new, and their adoption is still in the early stages. Many bitcoin softwares and services don\u2019t yet offer full support for what Taproot has to offer. It\u2019s also worth noting that most altcoins don\u2019t have these tools natively available. Final thoughts A growing number of institutions are becoming interested in securing a bitcoin treasury, and they require effective solutions. Avoiding single points of failure and minimizing counterparty risk are paramount considerations. The best way to meet these criteria is by leveraging a multisig structure, where keys can be distributed among various enterprise key agents, none of whom will have unilateral control over the bitcoin. Each key agent can use SSS or MPC to add extra threshold protection for their particular key. Unchained has pioneered an enterprise custody network, built for institutional clients who want to set up an arrangement like this. It\u2019s easy to use and customizable, so that each client gets to choose whether they\u2019d like to hold a controlling number of keys themselves, or just a single key, or leave the responsibility of securing keys entirely up to the several, independent enterprise key agents.

Ordinals have been a polarizing phenomenon for most every subcommunity in Bitcoin \u2014 except for miners. The meteoric rise of the new Bitcoin-native NFT standard dominated discourse for months as Ordinals flooded blockspace and buoyed transaction fees to multiyear highs. According to critics, these transactions are, at worst, an attack on Bitcoin that tainted the sanctity of scarce blockspace; at best, they are shitcoins, the play-things of gamblers that belong on casino chains like Ethereum. Well, miners don\u2019t give a shit if they\u2019re shitcoins. They give a shit about making money, and Ordinals gave them a revenue boost at a time when mining income was at one of its lowest points ever. So many miners have embraced \u2014 or at the least, are ambivalent about \u2014 Ordinals/inscriptions, since they received a much-needed boost to Bitcoin mining profitability when many miners were nearly breakeven or unprofitable. Hashprice is a measure of the USD (or BTC) amount miners can expect to earn from a unit of hashrate (for example, at $80/PH/day, a miner with 1 petahash of mining rigs \u2014 roughly 10 new-gen ASICs like the S19j Pro, for example \u2014 can earn $80 per day). Given their positive impact on hashprice, Ordinals, a darkhorse technical advancement that few could have predicted last year, have found themselves at the center of discussions regarding Bitcoin mining economics, discussions that are more germane with each block that pulls us closer to Bitcoin\u2019s fourth block subsidy halving. Click the image above to subscribe! I\u2019m not writing this to proselytize anyone into becoming an Ordinals enjoooyer. I, for one, don\u2019t really understand the appeal. But I do think that they\u2019re important in the context of Bitcoin\u2019s ever-dwindling block subsidy, so they\u2019re worth studying to understand how they affect blockspace and mining economics \u2014 and what developments like them might mean in a future where miners subsist solely on transaction fees. WTF is an Ordinal, Anyway? In NFT parlance, folks use Ordinal and inscription interchangeably, but the individual terms refer to two different aspects of the NFT standard. An inscription is a piece of art or digital media, while an Ordinal is technically the number prescribed to an inscription to mark its place in the grand scheme of all other inscriptions. Another way to view it is that the inscription itself is the NFT, while the Ordinal is the number used to identify an individual inscription. The data for each inscription lives in the Segregated Witness section of a transaction. As such, unlike other NFT standards, the actual art, digital media, or data is uploaded directly to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Since the inscriptions are fully on-chain, you could argue that they are the purest form of NFT available as they benefit from the blockchain\u2019s immutability. Not All Inscriptions Are Created Equal When you understand that inscriptions are actual on-chain data, you can appreciate some of the critiques and concerns from detractors; if a bunch of NFT degens are inscribing monkey JPEGs and dickbutts and God-knows-what-else on-chain, then this crowds out economic (and potentially necessary) transactions. This concern was aggravated by the fact that the arbitrary data for each inscription benefits from a transaction fee discount. As a scalability measure, Bitcoin\u2019s Segregated Witness upgrade modified the transaction structure so that the witness data for a private key signature and public key was moved from the transaction hash field to another part of the block. Bitcoin discounts SegWit data, so it requires fewer satoshis per byte in transaction fees to transact. The arbitrary data for an inscription lives in the SegWit field of a transaction, so it\u2019s entitled to the SegWit discount. Cue the pitchforks. This discount is why, despite the first wave of image-based inscriptions clogging block space in February/March/April, transaction fees did not meaningfully increase; block sizes swelled when trendsetting inscribers flushed the blockchain with thousands of JPEGs for the first inscriptions collections, but these all benefited from SegWit\u2019s 4-to-1 data discount versus normal transactions. Perhaps intuitively, it wasn\u2019t until less data-heavy, text-based inscriptions from BRC-20 tokens became the most popular inscription type that transaction fees soared. So-called BRC-20s (a nod to Ethereum\u2019s own ERC-20 token standard) are a loose form of token. I say loose because they are really just Ordinals in a series defined by Bitcoin\u2019s OP_CODE function, where each \u201ctoken\u201d is itself an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token\u2019s place in the specific BRC-20 series. It goes like this: Someone (God only knows who) publishes an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token series\u2019 max supply, ticker, and the minting limit per transaction. Once publicized, anyone with the technical know-how can mint tokens in the series. These OP_CODE transactions do not benefit from SegWit\u2019s data discount, so they cost a pretty penny more than image-based inscriptions. But they also have a feature that image inscriptions don\u2019t: the minting function, which brings Ethereum NFT-esque incentives to collecting these inscriptions. Ethereum NFT series typically have minting contracts where anyone can create new NFTs in the series by interacting with the contract. This is part of \u2014 if not the entire \u2014 appeal. Minting an NFT is like opening up a digital pack of Pokémon/baseball/Magic: The Gathering cards \u2014 maybe there\u2019s a rare card in this next one! And while there isn\u2019t necessarily the opportunity to mint a rare BRC-20 (because they are all the same), there\u2019s the chance to mint a bunch of NFTs in a hot new series. Why anyone cares about having ORDI/CUMY/RATS #1 or #100 or whatever, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps it\u2019s the greatest expression of the greater fool theory yet in Bitcoin. But the fact is, they do, and the minting incentives for BRC-20s precipitated the largest wave of Bitcoin transaction activity ever. Through a combination of fee wars and the fact that these NFTs don\u2019t benefit from the SegWit discount, BRC-20s have catered a veritable fee feast for Bitcoin miners, but not exactly in the way you might think. Quantifying Transaction Fee Collateral Damage The bulk of transaction fee increases in 2023 has not come directly from fees associated with Ordinals; it has come from indirect fee pressure on other transactions. Per data from independent analyst Data Always\u2019 Dune dashboard, as of November 12, 2023, miners have raked in $70.3 million fees from Ordinals. Seems bigly, but it\u2019s only 19.4% of the $368.2 million in transaction fees that miners have earned in total since inscriptions debuted on December 14, 2022. To put this into further perspective, there have been 40.2 million inscription transactions, which equates to 30% of all transaction volume since December 14. So inscriptions have accounted for one-third of transaction volume over the last year but only one-fifth of all fees. As for the other fees, many of them are the result of indirect fee pressure from inscriptions \u2014 that is, fees that do not come directly from inscriptions themselves, but from the pressure that inscriptions exert on the average transaction fee needed to clear a Bitcoin transaction in a reasonable time frame. Galaxy Digital Research examines this dynamic in a report titled \u201cBitcoin Inscriptions & Ordinals: A Maturing Ecosystem\u201d. Rampant inscription activity congests the mempool. This is particularly true during BRC-20 minting events, as the first-come-first-mint incentivizes bidding wars as inscribers gun to be the first to mint a series. This raises the floor for average transaction fees and, as Galaxy Digital Research points out, precipitates transaction fee \u201coverpayment\u201d from various transactors. They define overpayment as any fee in a block that is greater than that block\u2019s median transaction fee. For normal transactions, this overpayment could come from transaction fee estimators in wallets or on exchanges or from general user ignorance regarding transaction fee structure and dynamics. Some users may also need to expedite transactions for any number of reasons, leading to overpayment. For inscription transactions, Galaxy Digital Research says that \u201cvoluntary overpayment\u201d was commonplace during times of high activity and popular inscription mints. This chart quantifies overpayment for inscription transactions and all other transactions to demonstrate the dynamics Galaxy Digital Research outlines in their report. When Bitcoin\u2019s mempool became backlogged in April and May \u2014 the hottest time frame for inscription activity so far \u2014 a majority of the transaction fees during this time actually came from user overpayment for financial transactions, not inscriptions themselves. These users could probably make it easier on themselves by not using built-in transaction fee estimators with their wallets and exchanges. Blessing and a Curse Inscriptions are a blessing and a curse. They\u2019re a godsend for miners, but they can be a pain in the ass for other Bitcoiners, particularly those who have to send transactions on the network every day. That said, blockspace is an open market. So I don\u2019t have to like Ordinals to recognize that it\u2019s not my place to police someone else\u2019s spending. Nor is it my place to censor a transaction that pays for blockspace on the f(r)ee market. That\u2019s part of the point of a permissionless blockchain, after all: to make transactions other people don\u2019t want you to make.

The company intends to use the proceeds to acquire more Bitcoin, as per their recent press release, following a strategy it has pursued since 2020. MicroStrategy announced it had priced the 0.875% convertible senior notes due 2031 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. The notes will be sold at 100% of the principal amount with an annual interest rate of 0.875%, payable semiannually. After March 2028, the company can redeem the notes in cash at 100% of the principal plus accrued interest if certain conditions are met. Holders can require MicroStrategy to repurchase the notes at 100% of the principal amount plus interest on September 15, 2028, or upon certain events constituting a fundamental change. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of MicroStrategy's class A common stock, or a combination of both at the company's discretion. MicroStrategy estimates the net proceeds of the offering will be approximately $515 million after fees and expenses. Led by founder and CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has been aggressive in its bitcoin accumulation strategy. The company now holds more than 200,000 bitcoins worth over $13 billion at press time. Saylor has said he aims to position MicroStrategy as the world's first \"Bitcoin development company,\" though details on the proposal have been scant. In the past, MicroStrategy has released alpha applications, such as a tool for allowing businesses to reward employees using Bitcoin lightning payments. As a publicly traded company using its balance sheet to acquire bitcoin at scale, MicroStrategy's plans illustrate growing corporate interest in Bitcoin as an emerging asset class and treasury asset, one that can hedge against debasement and inflation.","article_summary":"MicroStrategy has upsized its planned convertible senior notes offering to $525 million in order to purchase more Bitcoin.","creation_date":"Fri, 15 Mar 2024 12:44:05 GMT","associated_tags":["Business"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-increases-loan-525-million-buy-bitcoin","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine"},{"article_title":"Your financial plan may be riskier without bitcoin ","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Jessy Gilger"},"article_detailed_content":"This article originally appeared in the Sound Advisory blog.

If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation, that He exists.\u201d - Blaise Pascal Blaise Pascal only lived to age 39 but became world-famous for many contributions in the fields of mathematics, physics, and theology. The above quote encapsulates Pascal\u2019s wager\u2014a philosophical argument for the Christian belief in the existence of God. The argument's conclusion states that a rational person should live as though God exists. Even if the probability is low, the reward is worth the risk. Pascal\u2019s wager as a justification for bitcoin? Yes, I\u2019m aware of the fallacies: false dichotomy, appeal to emotion, begging the question, etc. That is not the point. The point is that binary outcomes instigate extreme results, and the game theory of money suggests that it\u2019s a winner-take-all game. The Pascalian investor: A rational approach to bitcoin Humanity\u2019s adoption of \u201cthe best money over time\u201d mimics a series of binary outcomes\u2014A/B tests. Throughout history, inferior forms of money have faded as better alternatives emerged (see India\u2019s failed transition to a gold standard). And if bitcoin is trying to be the premier money of the future, it will either succeed or it won\u2019t. \u201cIf you ain\u2019t first, you\u2019re last.\u201d -Ricky Bobby, Talladega Nights, on which monies succeed over time. So, we can look at bitcoin success similarly to Pascal\u2019s wager\u2014let\u2019s call it Satoshi\u2019s wager. The translated points would go something like this: If you own bitcoin early and it becomes a globally valuable money, you gain immensely. 😀 If you own bitcoin and it fails, you\u2019ve lost that value. 😢 If you don\u2019t own bitcoin and it goes to zero, no pain and no gain. 😐 If you don\u2019t own bitcoin and it succeeds, you will have missed out on the significant financial revolution of our lifetimes and fall comparatively behind. 😡 If bitcoin is successful, it will be worth far more than it is today and have a massive impact on your financial future. If it fails, the losses are only limited to your exposure. The most that you could lose is the money that you invested. It is hypothetically possible that bitcoin could be worth 100x more than it is today, but it can only possibly lose 1x its value as it goes to zero. The concept we\u2019re discussing here is asymmetric upside - significant gains with relatively limited downside. In other words, the potential rewards of the investment outweigh the potential risks. Bitcoin offers an asymmetric upside that makes it a wise investment for most portfolios. Even a small allocation provides potential protection against extreme currency debasement. Salt, gasoline, and insurance \u201cDon\u2019t over salt your steak, pour too much gas on the fire, or buy too much insurance.\u201d A little bit goes a long way, and you can easily overdo it. The same applies when looking at bitcoin in the context of a financial plan. Bitcoin\u2019s asymmetric upside gives it \u201cinsurance-like\u201d qualities, and that insurance pays off very well in times of money printing. This was exemplified in 2020 when bitcoin's value increased over 300% in response to pandemic money printing, far outpacing stocks, gold, and bonds. Bitcoin offers a similar asymmetric upside today. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it resistant to inflationary debasement. In contrast, the dollar's purchasing power consistently declines through unrestrained money printing. History has shown that societies prefer money that is hard to inflate. If recent rampant inflation is uncontainable and the dollar system falters, bitcoin is well-positioned as a successor. This global monetary A/B test is still early, but given their respective sizes, a little bitcoin can go a long way. If it succeeds, early adopters will benefit enormously compared to latecomers. Of course, there are no guarantees, but the potential reward justifies reasonable exposure despite the risks. Let\u2019s imagine Nervous Nancy, an extremely conservative investor. She wants to invest but also take the least risk possible. She invests 100% of her money in short-term cash equivalents (short-term treasuries, money markets, CDs, maybe some cash in the coffee can). With this investment allocation, she\u2019s nearly certain to get her initial investment back and receive a modest amount of interest as a gain. However, she has no guarantees that the investment returned to her will purchase the same amount as it used to. Inflation and money printing cause each dollar to be able to purchase less and less over time. Depending on the severity of the inflation, it might not buy anything at all. In other words, she didn\u2019t lose any dollars, but the dollar lost purchasing power. Now, let\u2019s salt her portfolio with bitcoin. 99% short-term treasuries. 1% bitcoin. With a 1% allocation, if bitcoin goes to zero overnight, she\u2019ll have only lost a penny on the dollar, and her treasury interest will quickly fill the gap. Not at all catastrophic to her financial future. However, if the hypothetical hyperinflationary scenario from above plays out and bitcoin grows 100x in purchasing power, she\u2019s saved everything. Metaphorically, her entire dollar house burned down, and \u201cbitcoin insurance\u201d made her whole. Powerful. A little bitcoin salt goes a long way. (When protecting against the existing system, it\u2019s important to remember that you need to get your bitcoin out of the system. Keeping bitcoin on an exchange or with a counterparty will do you no good if that entity fails. If you view bitcoin as insurance, it\u2019s essential to keep your bitcoin in cold storage and hold your keys. Otherwise, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s insurance.) When all you have a hammer, everything looks like a\u2026 A construction joke: There are only three rules to construction: 1.) Always use the right tool for the job! 2.) A hammer is always the right tool! 3.) Anything can be a hammer! Yeah. That\u2019s what I thought, too. Slightly funny and mostly useless. But if you spend enough time swinging a hammer, you\u2019ll eventually realize it can be more than it first appears. Not everything is a nail. A hammer can tear down walls, break concrete, tap objects into place, and wiggle other things out. A hammer can create and destroy; it builds tall towers and humbles novice fingers. The use cases expand with the skill of the carpenter. Like hammers, bitcoin is a monetary tool. And a 1-5% allocator to the asset typically sees a \u201cspeculative insurance\u201d use case - valid. Bitcoin is speculative insurance, but it is not only speculative insurance. People invest and save in bitcoin for many different reasons. I\u2019ve seen people use bitcoin to pursue all of the following use cases: Hedging against a financial collapse (speculative insurance) Saving for family and future (long-term general savings and safety net) Growing a downpayment for a house (medium-term specific savings) Shooting for the moon in a manner equivalent to winning the lottery (gambling) Opting out of government-run, bank-controlled financial systems (financial optionality) Making a quick buck (short-term trading) Escaping a hostile country (wealth evacuation) Locking away wealth that can\u2019t be confiscated (wealth preservation) As a means to influence opinions and gain followers (social status) Fix the money and fix the world (mission and purpose) Keep this in mind when taking other people\u2019s financial advice. They are often playing a different game than you. They have different goals, upbringings, worldviews, family dynamics, and circumstances. Even though they might use the same hammer as you, it could be for a completely different job. Wrapping Up A massive allocation to bitcoin may seem crazy to some people, yet perfectly reasonable to others. The same goes for having a 1% allocation. But, given today\u2019s macroeconomic environment and bitcoin\u2019s trajectory, I find very few use cases where 0% bitcoin makes sense. By not owning bitcoin, you implicitly say that you are 100% certain it will fail and go to zero. Given its 14-year history so far, I\u2019d recommend reducing your confidence. Nobody is 100% right forever. A little salt goes a long way. Your financial plan may be riskier without bitcoin. Diversify accordingly. \u201cWe must learn our limits. We are all something, but none of us are everything.\u201d - Blaise Pascal. Contact Office: (208)-254-0142 408 South Eagle Rd.

By receiving an official blessing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an institutional investing barrier has been lifted. With this barrier gone, financial advisors, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies and retail investors can now receive Bitcoin exposure without hassling with direct custodianship. More importantly, a taint has been scrubbed off from Bitcoin, previously likened to \u201ctulip mania\u201d, \u201crat poison\u201d, or \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d. Following the unprecedented domino of crypto bankruptcies throughout 2022, Bitcoin price reverted to November 2020 level of $15.7k by the end of that year. After that great FUD reservoir was drained, Bitcoin slowly recovered during 2023 and entered 2024 at $45k level, first visited in February 2021. With the 4th Bitcoin halving ahead in April, and with ETFs setting new market dynamics, what should Bitcoin investors expect next? To determine that, one must understand how Bitcoin ETFs elevated BTC trading volume, effectively stabilizing Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility. Understanding Bitcoin ETFs and Market Dynamics Bitcoin itself represents the democratization of money. Not beholden to central authority like the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network of miners and algorithmically determined monetary policy ensures that its limited 21 million coin supply can\u2019t be tampered with. For BTC investors, this means they can be exposed to an asset that is not on an inherent trajectory of devaluation, which is in stark contrast to all existing fiat currencies in the world. This is the foundation for Bitcoin\u2019s perception of value. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) present another democratization pathway. The purpose of ETFs is to track an asset\u2019s price, represented by shares, and enable trading throughout the day unlike actively managed mutual funds. The ETFs\u2019 passive price tracking ensures lower fees, making it an accessible investment vehicle. Of course, it would be up to Bitcoin custodians like Coinbase to enact sufficient cloud security to instill investor confidence. In the ETF universe, Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated high demand for a decentralized asset that is resistant to centralized dilution. Altogether in the last 15 days, they have resulted in $29.3 billion trading volume against $14.9 billion pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC (GBTC). Image credit: Bloomberg Intelligence via James Seyffart This is not surprising. As Bitcoin price moved up due to Bitcoin ETF hype, 88% of all Bitcoin holders entered the profit zone in December 2023, eventually reaching 90% in February. In turn, GBTC investors were cashing out, placing a downward pressure worth $5.6 billion on Bitcoin price. Moreover, GBTC investors took advantage of lower fees from the newly approved Bitcoin ETFs, shifting funds from GBTC\u2019s relatively high 1.50% fee. At the end of the day, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the volume winner at 0.12% fee, which will go up to 0.25% after a 12-month waiver period. To place this in the context of the wider ETF universe, IBIT and FBTC managed to outpace iShares Climate Conscious & Transition MSCI USA ETF (USCL), launched in June 2023, within a month of trading. Image credit: Bloomberg Intelligence via Eric Balchunas This is particularly indicative given that Bitcoin\u2019s history is one of attacks coming from the sustainability direction. It bears reminding that Bitcoin price fell 12%, in May 2021, shortly after Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla no longer accepts BTC payments precisely due to eco concerns. During January, IBIT and FBTC found themselves at 8th and 10th place respectively as ETFs with the largest net asset inflows, headed by iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to Morning Star report. With daily ~10,000 BTC streaming into ETFs, this represents a greatly lopsided demand over ~900 BTC mined per day. Moving forward, as the GBTC outflow pressure wanes and inflow trend increases, the steady stream of funds into Bitcoin ETFs is poised to stabilize BTC price. The Mechanism of Stabilization With 90% of Bitcoin holders entering the profit zone, highest since October 2021, selloff pressures can come from many sources, institutional, miner and retail. The higher inflow trend in Bitcoin ETFs is the bulwark against it, especially heading into another hype event - 4th Bitcoin halving. Higher trading volumes generate higher liquidity, smoothing out price movements. That\u2019s because larger volumes between both buyers and sellers absorb temporary imbalances. During January, CoinShares\u2019 report showed $1.4 billion of Bitcoin inflows, together with $7.2 billion from newly issued US-based funds, against the GBTC outflows of $5.6 billion. At $1.4 billion, Bitcoin represents 96% of total flows in the US. Image credit: CoinShares In the meantime, large financial institutions are setting new liquidity baselines. As of February 6th, Fidelity Canada set up 1% Bitcoin allocation within its All-in-One Conservative ETF Fund. Given its \u201cconservative\u201d moniker, this signals even greater percentage allocations in future non-conservative funds. Ultimately, if Bitcoin taps into 1% of the $749.2 trillion market pool of various asset classes, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap could grow to $7.4 trillion, bringing Bitcoin price to $400k. Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap is within $0.85 - $0.9 billion range. Image credit: Blockware Solutions Given that Bitcoin ETFs provide a consistent and transparent market price reference point, large aggregated trades reduce market impact on potential selloffs coming from miners. This is visible from FalconX Research, showing a great uptick in daily aggregate volumes, previously from average 5% heading into the 10 - 13% range. In other words, the new Bitcoin ETF-induced market regime is reducing overall market volatility. So far, Bitcoin miners have been the main price-suppressing driver on the other side of the liquidity equation. In Bitfinex\u2019s latest weekly on-chain report, miner wallets were responsible for 10,200 BTC in outflows. This matches the aforementioned ~10,000 BTC inflows in Bitcoin ETFs, resulting in relatively stable price levels. As miners reinvest and upgrade mining rigs ahead of the 4th halving, another stabilizing mechanism could come into play - options. Although the SEC is yet to approve options on spot-traded BTC ETFs, this development will further expand ETF liquidity. After all, the greater spectrum of investing strategies revolving around hedging increases liquidity on both sides of the trade. As a forward-looking metric, implied volatility in options trading gauges market sentiment. But the greater market maturity that we will inevitably see following the introduction of BTC ETFs, we\u2019re more likely to see a more stabilized pricing of options and derivative contracts in general. Analyzing Inflows and Market Sentiment As of February 9th, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) holds 468,786 BTC. Over the last week, the BTC price went up 8.6% to $46.2k. Concurrent with the previous forecast, this means that BTC dumping is likely to spread out over multiple rallies ahead of the 4th halving and beyond. By latest numbers provided by Farside Investors, as of February 8th, Bitcoin ETFs have racked up $403 million inflows, totaling to $2.1 billion. GBTC outflows totaled $6.3 billion. Image credit: Farside Investors From January 11th to February 8th, GBTC outflows have steadily decreased. Within the first week, they averaged $492 million. In the second week, GBTC outflows averaged $313 million, ending in $115 million on average during the third week. Source: Farside Investors, image credit: Bitcoin Magazine On a weekly basis, this represents a 36% reduction on sell pressure from week one to two, and 63% reduction from week two to three. As GBTC FUD unfolded up to February 9th, crypto fear & greed index elevated to \u201cgreed\u201d at 72 points. This represents a revisit to January 12th, at 71 points, just a few days after Bitcoin ETF approvals. Looking ahead, it bears noticing that Bitcoin price is reliant on global liquidity. After all, it was the Fed\u2019s interest rate hiking cycle in March 2022 that caused the avalanche of crypto bankruptcies, culminating in the FTX collapse. Current fed fund futures project the end of that cycle either in May or in June. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that the Federal Reserve will veer off the money printing course. And at such occasions, Bitcoin price followed suit. M2 money supply measures how much money is available in an economy. Image credit: LookIntoBitcoin.com Considering the insurmountable national debt of $34 trillion, while the federal spending keeps outpacing revenue, Bitcoin is positioning itself as a safe haven asset. One that waits for capital inflows into its limited 21 million coin supply. Historical Context and Future Implications As a similar safe haven asset, Gold Bullion Securities (GBS) launched as the first gold ETF in March 2003 on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Next year, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) launched on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Within a week from November 18th, 2004, GLD\u2019s total net assets rose up from $114,920,000 to $1,456,602,906. By the end of December, this decreased to $1,327,960,347. To reach BlackRock\u2019s IBIT market value of $3.5 billion, it took GLD up to November 22nd 2005. Although not inflation-adjusted, this indicates Bitcoin\u2019s superior market sentiment compared to gold. Bitcoin is digital, yet it is grounded in a proof-of-work mining network spanning the globe. Its digital nature translates to portability which can not be said of gold. The USG showcased this point when President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102 in 1933 for citizens to sell their gold bullions. Likewise, new gold veins are frequently discovered which dampens its limited supply status in contrast to Bitcoin. In addition to these fundamentals, Bitcoin ETF options are yet to materialize. Nonetheless, Standard Chartered analysts project $50 to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Moreover, large companies are yet to follow MicroStrategy\u2019s lead by effectively converting shares sales into a depreciating asset. Even 1% BTC allocations across mutual funds are poised to skyrocket BTC price. Case in point, Advisors Preferred Trust set up a 15% range allocation into indirect Bitcoin exposure via futures contracts and BTC ETFs. Conclusion After 15 years of doubt and aspersions, Bitcoin has reached the apex of credibility. The first wave of believers in sound money ensured that the blockchain version of it is not lost in the bin of coding history. On the back of their confidence, up until now, Bitcoin investors constituted the second wave. The Bitcoin ETF milestone represents the third wave exposure milestone. Central banks around the world continue to erode confidence in money, as governments cannot help themselves but to indulge in spending. With so much noise introduced into the exchange of value, Bitcoin represents a return to the sound money root. Its saving grace is digital, but also physical proof-of-work as energy. Barring extreme USG action to sabotage institutional exposure, Bitcoin could even overtake gold as a traditional safe haven asset. This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.

The judge promised to provide detailed reasons for his decision at a later date. The trial unfolded amidst ongoing legal battles between Wright and COPA, with Wright issuing a settlement offer to the alliance and other involved parties.

However, COPA rejected the offer, emphasizing that it would imply acceptance of Wright's self-proclaimed identity as Satoshi Nakamoto.

In a recent interview, Back explained his bullish perspective on Bitcoin's potential. \"I think it's kind of overdue already,\" he said about Bitcoin reaching a six-figure valuation. \"Bitcoin has been performing quite well, and many new applications like Strike have come online, providing easy user interfaces. The fundamentals and price have diverged somewhat, so I think the price will catch up.\" Back doubled down on his $100,000 prediction in a post on X saying, \"I think the reason things are muted is that $100k seems way overdue, for a few years now. There's not much bull market euphoria as the $1-5k green candles scroll by. Just tick tock $100k.\" Back's comments come after Bitcoin rallied in 2023 following a brutal bitcoin winter in 2022. The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January has since reignited interest in the asset class.

When talking about fiat currencies, debasement traditionally refers to the practice of reducing the precious metal content in coins while keeping their nominal value the same, thereby diluting the coin\u2019s intrinsic worth. In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency \u2014 such as when central banks increase the supply of money, in the process lowering the nominal value of each unit. UNDERSTANDING DEBASEMENT Before paper money and coins made of cheap metals like nickel, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver. These were the most sought after metals of the time, giving them value beyond government decree. Debasement was a common practice to save on precious metals and use them in a mix of lower-value metals instead. This practice of mixing the precious metals with a lower-quality metal means authorities could create additional coins with the same face value, expanding the money supply for a fraction of the cost compared to coins with more gold and silver content. Today, coins and notes don't have inherent worth, they are simply tokens that represent value. This means debasement relies on supply: i.e. how many coins or notes the issuing body allows to circulate. Debasement went through different processes and methods over time; therefore, we can define old and new methods. TRADITIONAL METHOD Coin clipping, sweating, and plugging were the most common debasement processes used until the introduction of paper money. Such methods were employed both by malicious actors that counterfeited coins and by authorities that increased the number of coins in circulation. Clipping involves \u201cshaving\u201d the coins\u2019 edges to remove some of the metal. As with sweating, the resulting clipped bits would be collected and used to make new counterfeit coins. Sweating involves shaking coins vigorously in a bag until the edges of the coins come off and lay at the bottom. The pieces are then collected and used to create new coins. Plugging was a way of punching a hole out of the coin\u2019s middle area with the rest of the coin hammered together to close the gap. It could also be sawn in half with a plug of metal extracted from the interior. After filling the hole with a cheaper metal, the two halves would be fused again. MODERN-DAY METHODS Money supply increase is the modern method used by governments to debase the currency. By printing more money, governments get more funds to spend but it results in inflation for its citizens. Currency can be debased by increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, or implementing other measures that encourage inflation; they\u2019re all \u201cgood\u201d ways of reducing the value of a currency. WHY IS MONEY DEBASED? Governments debase their currency so that they can spend without raising further taxes. Debasing money to fund wars was an effective way of increasing the money supply to engage in expensive conflicts without affecting people\u2019s finances \u2014 or so it is believed. Whether by traditional debasement or modern money printing, money supply increases have short-sighted benefits in boosting the economy. But in the long term, it leads to inflation and financial crises. The effects of this are felt most acutely by those in society who do not own hard assets that might counter the loss in the currency\u2019s value. Currency debasement could also occur by malicious actors who introduce counterfeit coins to an economy, but the consequence of being caught can in some countries lead to a death sentence. \u201cInflation is legal counterfeiting, Counterfeiting is illegal inflation.\u201d - Robert Breedlove Governments can take some measures to mitigate risks associated with money debasement and prevent unstable and weak economies, for example by controlling the money supply and interest rates within a specific range, managing spending, and avoiding excessive borrowing. Any economic reform that promotes productivity and attracts foreign investments helps maintain confidence in the currency and prevent money debasement. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES The Roman Empire The first example of currency debasement dates back to the Roman Empire under emperor Nero around 60 A.D. Nero reduced the silver content in the denarius coins from 100% to 90% during his tenure. Emperor Vespasian and his son Titus had enormous expenditures via post-civil war reconstruction projects like the building of the Colosseum, compensation to the victims of the Vesuvius eruption, and the Great Fire of Rome in 64 A.D. The chosen means to survive the financial crisis was to reduce the silver content of the \u201cdenarius\u201d from 94% to 90%. Titus\u2019 brother and successor, Domitian, saw enough value in \u201chard money\u201d and the stability of a credible money supply that he increased the silver content of the denarius back to 98% \u2014 a decision he had to revert when another war broke out, and inflation was looming again across the empire. This process gradually continued until the silver content measured just 5% in the following centuries. The Empire began to experience severe financial crises and inflation as the money continued to be devalued \u2014 particularly during the 3rd century A.D., sometimes referred to as the \u201cCrisis of the Third Century.\u201d During this period, spanning from about A.D. 235 to A.D. 284, Romans demanded higher wages and an increase in the price of the goods they were selling to face currency depreciation. The era was marked by political instability, external pressures from barbarian invasions, and internal issues such as economic decline and plague. It was only when Emperor Diocletian and later Constantine took various measures, including introducing new coinage and implementing price controls, that the Roman economy began to stabilize. However, these events highlighted the vulnerabilities of the once-mighty Roman economic system. Read More >> Hard To Soft Money: The Hyperinflation Of The Roman Empire OTTOMAN EMPIRE During the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman official monetary unit, the akçe, was a silver coin that went through consistent debasement from 0.85 grams contained in a coin in the 15th century down to 0.048 grams in the 19th century. The measure to lower the intrinsic value of the coinage was taken to make more coins and increase the money supply. New currencies, the kuruş in 1688 and then the lira in 1844, gradually replaced the original official akçe due to its continuous debasement. HENRY VIII Under Henry VIII, England needed more money, so his chancellor started to debase the coins using cheaper metals like copper in the mix to make more coins for a more affordable cost. At the end of his reign, the silver content of the coins went down from 92.5% to only 25% as a way to make more money and fund the heavy military expenses the current European war was demanding. WEIMAR REPUBLIC During the Weimar Republic of the 1920s, the German government met its war and post-war financial obligations by printing more money. The measure reduced the mark\u2019s value from around eight marks per dollar to 184. By 1922, the mark had depreciated to 7,350, eventually collapsing in a painful hyperinflation when it reached 4.2 trillion marks per USD. History offers us poignant reminders of the perils of monetary expansion. These once-powerful empires all serve as cautionary tales for the modern fiat system. As these empires expanded their money supply, devaluing their currencies, they were, in many ways, like the proverbial lobster in boiling water. The temperature \u2014 or in this case, the rate of monetary debasement \u2014 increased so gradually that they failed to recognize the impending danger until it was too late. Just as a lobster doesn't appear to realize it\u2019s being boiled alive if the water\u2019s temperature rises slowly, these empires didn\u2019t grasp the full extent of their economic vulnerabilities until their systems became untenable. The gradual erosion of their monetary value was not just an economic issue; it was a symptom of deeper systemic problems, signaling the waning strength of once-mighty empires. DEBASEMENT IN THE MODERN ERA The dissolution of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s marked a pivotal moment in global economic history. Established in the mid-20th century, the Bretton Woods system had loosely tethered major world currencies to the U.S. dollar, which itself was backed by gold, ensuring a degree of economic stability and predictability. However, its dissolution effectively untethered money from its golden roots. This shift granted central bankers and politicians greater flexibility and discretion in monetary policy, allowing for more aggressive interventions in economies. While this newfound freedom offered tools to address short-term economic challenges, it also opened the door to misuse and a gradual weakening of the economy. In the wake of this monumental change, the US has experienced significant alterations in its monetary policy and money supply. By 2023, the monetary base had surged to 5.6 trillion dollars, representing an approximate 69-fold growth from its level of 81.2 billion dollars in 1971. As we reflect on the modern era and the significant changes in U.S. monetary policy, it\u2019s crucial to heed these historical lessons. Continuous debasement and unchecked monetary expansion can only go on for so long before the system reaches a breaking point. EFFECTS OF DEBASEMENT Currency debasement can have several significant effects on an economy, varying in magnitude depending on the extent of debasement and the underlying economic conditions. Here are some of the most impactful consequences that currency debasement can generate over the long term. Higher inflation rates Higher inflation rates are the most immediate and impactful effects of currency debasement. As the currency\u2019s value decreases, it takes more units to purchase the same goods and services, eroding the purchasing power of money. Increasing Interest Rates Central banks may respond to currency debasement and rising inflation by increasing interest rates, which can impact borrowing costs, business investments, and consumer spending patterns. Deteriorating the Value of Savings Currency debasement can deteriorate the value of savings held in the domestic currency. This is particularly detrimental to individuals with fixed-income assets, such as retirees who rely on pensions or interest income. More Expensive Imports A debased currency can make imports more expensive, potentially leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers reliant on foreign goods. However, it may also make exports more competitive internationally, as foreign buyers can purchase domestic goods at a lower price. Undermining Public Confidence in the Economy Continuous currency debasement can undermine public confidence in the domestic currency and the government\u2019s ability to manage the economy effectively. This loss of trust may further exacerbate economic instability and even hyperinflation. SOLUTION TO DEBASEMENT The solution to debasement lies in the reintroduction of sound money \u2014 money whose supply cannot be easily manipulated. While many nostalgically yearn for a return to the gold standard, which was arguably superior to contemporary systems, it is not the ultimate solution. The reason lies in the centralization of gold by central banks. Should we revert to a gold standard, history would likely repeat itself, leading to confiscation and the debasement of currencies once again. Put simply, if a currency can be debased, it will be. How Bitcoin Avoids Debasement Bitcoin offers a permanent solution to this issue. Its supply is capped at 21 million, a number that is hard-coded and safeguarded by proof-of-work mining and a decentralized network of nodes. Thanks to its decentralized nature, no single entity or government can control Bitcoin\u2019s issuance or governance. Furthermore, its inherent scarcity makes it resilient to the inflationary pressures that are typically seen with traditional fiat currencies. As a distributed system, Bitcoin users can ensure that the supply never deviates from the predetermined supply cap by running the software that downloads and validates the entire transactional ledger. By verifying every transaction in Bitcoin\u2019s history, where every coin came from and where it went, users can be absolutely sure that the supply has not been debased and no coins were created that should not have been. Full node software like this for Bitcoin is essentially a counterfeiting detection machine that anyone can run. It guarantees the supply is intact, that coins being spent were properly authorized, and no funny business is happening. Any Bitcoin wallet software can also ensure that no one can restrict your access to your own money. In times of economic uncertainty, or when central banks engage in extensive money printing, investors often turn to assets like gold and bitcoin for their store-of-value properties. As time progresses, there\u2019s potential for people to recognize Bitcoin not just as a store of value, but as the next evolution of money.","article_summary":"Bitcoin has been touted as the solution to monetary debasement, but what is debasement really, and where does it come from?

Using only the first four letters of the BIP39 seed words, a 12-word seed phrase can be stored in a mere 48 nucleotides of DNA. (For comparison, the average gene is several thousand nucleotides long, and the complete human genome contains over 3 billion nucleotides). Any genetics graduate student could, in just a few days, turn my seed word sequence into an actual strand of DNA and insert that DNA into E. coli or some other suitable host for storage (and propagation) inside a living organism. DNA is just one modality for storing and transmitting information. There are numerous other ways to do so and once information is widely distributed it is nearly impossible to extinguish, which is why it will be impossible to stop Bitcoin on a global scale with regulation, legislation, or even violence. The mere fact that you can store a bitcoin private key in DNA demonstrates the futility of attempting to ban Bitcoin. Once unleashed, information is hard to contain. But why is information so hard to contain? Perhaps because information is a fundamental entity of the universe. For centuries scientists thought the universe was made only of matter and energy. Today, we know it is made of matter, energy, and information. Information can be stored in matter and transmitted using energy, but information itself is neither. Einstein showed us that matter and energy are interchangeable (E=mc2) but in toto cannot be created nor destroyed. By contrast, information can be created and destroyed, but neither is easy. And once information is created and widely distributed, it is increasingly difficult to destroy. The Parts of Information Information is meant to be sent and received between two or more parties. It is done with a purpose by the sender and is meant to spur action in the receiver. There are five hierarchical components to information: Fidelity Syntax (code or grammar) Semantics (meaning) Pragmatics (action) Apobetics (purpose) Fidelity Fidelity is the lowest element of information, but it is absolutely necessary for successful transmission. It was once a major issue for cell phone and internet communication. Remember the \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d commercial? With technical advancements, low fidelity eventually became high fidelity (which weirdly became wireless fidelity, or Wi-Fi). Generally, we are not concerned with fidelity unless it is lacking. (Can you hear me now?) The Code and Language Syntax refers to the code or grammar used for transmitting information. A code is a set of symbols that represent temporally or spatially interconnectable bits of information. That is, symbols can be strung together in time or space to achieve the next level of information (semantics). The symbols used can vary tremendously. They include, among other things, the letters that make up an alphabet, hand gestures (e.g., American Sign Language), musical notes (e.g., those old modem connections and touch tone phones), or the nucleotides in DNA and RNA. The number of symbols used can vary, as well. Most alphabets use 20-35 letters, the nucleotide code uses four chemicals (abbreviated A, U, C, and G), and the binary code employed by computers has just two symbols (0 and 1) representing the on and off states. The number and type of symbols employed are not selected randomly. For instance, they may be determined by the mode of transmission or to meet a specific need (Table 1). Table 1: Symbols may be chosen for mode of transmission or to meet a specific need. A common code is essential for information to be successfully communicated. That is, the code must be known to both the sender and the receiver. Also, because the code is not itself the information but merely the purveyor of information, any particular code can be translated to any other code. For example, written human languages can be translated from one to another: Go tell it on the mountain\u2026 Va le dire sur la montagne\u2026 Ve a contario en la montaña\u2026 The above phrase can also be translated, using human eyes, brain, and mouth, from symbols on a page into sound waves (acoustic symbols) in the air, which can be picked up by a microphone and converted to electrical signals in wires and then to radio waves transmitted through space to be picked up by an antenna on the space station, turned back into electrical signals, and then converted by a speaker back into sound waves to be heard by the ears of another human. In the ears of our human astronaut, the signal is converted from waves of air to waves of fluid in the cochlea and then to electrical nerve impulses carried to the brain to be interpreted by neurons. In the brain, those neurons somehow make sense of the original string of symbols, which brings us to the next level of information: semantics or meaning. Semantics, Pragmatics, and Apobetics Semantics is the meaning or intent of a message (a string of symbols). The allocation of meaning to symbols is a mental process. This doesn\u2019t happen at the machine level but at the human level. When you read a book, you are not interested in fidelity (unless it is lacking) or syntax (unless the grammar is horrible or it\u2019s a language you do not understand). Instead, you are interested in the meaning conveyed by the message, i.e., the semantics. Although computers can store and transmit information with ease, and can even perform logic operations via transistors, they cannot meaningfully interpret information the way a human can. Do raspberry pi nodes, hardware wallets, or ASICs understand Bitcoin the way a human does? I think not. The aim of meaningful communication is to prompt some action in the recipient. This aim for action represents the pragmatic level of information. The reason the sender wishes to prompt this response is the purpose of the information, which is the apobetic level of information. These highest levels of information require genuine intelligence on both parties, even a will. Whether or not computers can ever possess a will remains to be seen. \u201cGo tell it on the mountain\u2026\u201d is a string of symbols (code) that create a meaningful message (semantics) with the sender expecting (apobetics) some response from the receiver (pragmatics). The message can only be received if transmitted adequately (good fidelity). Bitcoin as Information Bitcoin (the program) is computer code written in a particular coding language. From the software to the blockchain to the key pairs of wallets, bitcoin is information. This information can be stored, transmitted, and replicated in flash drives, printed books, or DNA molecules. Because it is now so widely dispersed, it is virtually impossible at this point to destroy. Politicians and bankers may not like it, but the genie is out of the bottle and cannot be stopped now. As they say, you cannot ban Bitcoin, you can only ban yourself from using Bitcoin. Fidelity and syntax are the operational parts of information. Semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics are the higher levels of information concerned with the purpose and response of intelligent beings based on the meaning of the message. In Bitcoin, fidelity \u2013 or clarity of transmission \u2013 is achieved by the internet (and has even been accomplished by HAM radio) connecting a network of nodes, miners, and wallets. The syntax of Bitcoin consists of the coding languages used to write and execute Bitcoin Core and related software on those devices. The meaning, or semantics, of Bitcoin is a perfectly scarce, immutable, digital token. The highest purposes of Bitcoin \u2013 the pragmatics and apobetics \u2013 are demonstrated in the users that run miners, nodes, and wallets who are motivated and seeking to secure their wealth from theft, either by robbery or debasement. The internet is now a mature and high-fidelity communication system. It cannot be destroyed without simultaneously destroying humanity as we know it. The computer codes and languages utilized by Bitcoin are sufficiently distributed such that eliminating them is essentially impossible. But even if you could somehow destroy the fidelity and syntax of the network, the idea of Bitcoin \u2013 the semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics \u2013 is too widely distributed to defeat. At this point, it has found its way into the minds of millions of people around the globe. Perhaps you could destroy the internet and every last hard drive holding the blockchain and every last computer running Bitcoin, but you would have to hunt down every last Bitcoiner to eradicate the idea of Bitcoin. And who knows, due to the ungovernable actions of some mad scientist, you might have to hunt down all the E. coli, too. This is a guest post by Daniel Howell.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Bitcoin has had another period of intense and record-breaking success, spurred on both by positive developments in international business and by increasingly large commitments from the spheres of traditional finance. It\u2019s truly stunning how well Bitcoin has been performing throughout the first quarter of 2024. The year began with Bitcoin\u2019s valuation crossing the $40k mark, and March 1 saw a persistent hover around $60k. Now, however, Bitcoin has gone up to $72k, the highest valuation in its entire history. Although we still are not quite at the level where \u201cdigital gold\u201d is more valuable than gold itself, we have even reached a new milestone: by market cap, Bitcoin is currently a more valuable commodity than silver. Considering the immense role that silver has played in global currency for thousands of years, this is certainly a milestone to remember. This period of success has been especially noteworthy for the continued confidence it\u2019s been enjoying from some of the largest financial institutions in the world. On March 10, for example, it was reported that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager and prominent issuer of the Bitcoin spot ETF, had finally acquired enough bitcoin that it surpassed even the holdings of MicroStrategy. Considering that its board chairman, Michael Saylor, is such a Bitcoin evangelist, this development seemed especially huge. It was an even bigger surprise, however, when Saylor announced that he was buying enough to reclaim its leading position the very next day. Less than 24 hours passed between this original announcement and MicroStrategy\u2019s purchase of 12k bitcoin, and this purchase took place when Bitcoin was already enjoying a price point over $70k. This purchase put MicroStrategy at the head of nearly every other private bitcoin stockpile, from all publicly traded miners to several major exchanges and ETF issuers. It\u2019s a stunning display of confidence in Bitcoin that anyone is prepared to make such major investments at a time when it\u2019s never been more expensive. It seems that the mood in these companies is that the all-time highs of today will seem like a paltry sum in just a few years. Analysts from ETF issuer Bitwise, for example, were confident enough in their prediction that corporate entities representing trillions of dollars would begin ramping up investments that Bitwise\u2019s Chief Investment Officer released an official memo on the subject. Claiming \u201cserious due diligence\u201d conversations with everyone from hedge funds to massive corporations, the memo predicts that Q2 will see even more massive inflows than the first three months of the year. This just leaves us with one question: Where does this kind of confidence come from? The center of the issue seems to be the runaway success of the Bitcoin ETF and, in particular, BlackRock\u2019s dominating position over the main issuers. Initially, it struggled with Grayscale, which had several natural advantages: it was a Bitcoin-native company with a massive stockpile, it was a real leader in the legal battle to actually get SEC approval, its GBTC was a previously-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, and it had other tricks up its sleeve. Nevertheless, BlackRock is the ETF that reached $10 billion faster than any other in history, shooting ahead of all other Bitcoin competitors and indeed all ETFs in general. Much of this revenue came from users fleeing GBTC\u2019s high fees, and it seems like a confident industry leader today. Its success has even matured to the international stage, as Mudrex, a crypto investment platform based in India, is opening up BlackRock ETF sales to institutional and private investors in a country with more than 1 billion people. This kind of success from BlackRock in particular has also led some of its competitors to change up their tactical approach. VanEck, for example, made an announcement on March 11 that they were waiving all fees on their Bitcoin ETF for an entire year. This will only continue so long as their VanEck Bitcoin Trust is under $1.5 billion, but the fees after this window will still be some of the lowest available. Grayscale, for its part, is also seeking to address the problem of high fees by spinning off a \u201cmini-version\u201d of its ETF, offering fractions of Bitcoin for a fraction of GBTC\u2019s fees. It seems that BlackRock\u2019s competitors are not yet willing to concede a market with such tremendous growth potential. However, although the ETF market has been especially hot lately, that is not the only reason to believe that Bitcoin\u2019s doing so well. ABC News, for example, credits some positive developments from the United Kingdom as a major factor in Bitcoin\u2019s price jump. Britain has previously been considered a particularly hostile regulatory environment for Bitcoin, especially the ETF, trailing behind both Western Europe and most of the Anglosphere in official Bitcoin approval. It was quite a surprise, then, when the London Stock Exchange (LSE) released a new factsheet on exchange-traded notes (ETNs), deciding that this type of financial instrument would be offered on their platform. ETNs do differ substantially from ETFs, even those like the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has no direct link to Bitcoin itself. ETNs are a type of debt security and do not even include the proviso that the issuer actually holds the bitcoin in question. Still, they are directly tied to the value of Bitcoin and offer investors a way to gain exposure to the world\u2019s leading digital asset. Considering that these ETNs are subject to the stringent rules that govern securities, it\u2019s particularly interesting that the LSE has suddenly changed its tune on Bitcoin-related financial products. In other words, it seems that the sea change in legal Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States has undeniably changed the calculus for businesses worldwide. With all these billions flowing into the Bitcoin ETF, even an unfriendly regulator like Great Britain must join in the bonanza if it wishes to maintain relevance as a leading hub of global finance. These are just a few of the developments that have occurred in the world of Bitcoin, as the intersection between decentralized currency and traditional finance has become both broader and deeper. Looking forward, there are still plenty of upcoming events, like the halving predicted in April, to keep propelling the hype forward. It may be difficult to predict exactly where the next major development and price jump will come from, but right now it looks as if there is a growing faith coming from some true financial giants. Bitcoin has come an incredibly long way since the days of its total pariah status, and now there\u2019s well over a trillion dollars in the market. With growth like that, it\u2019s an easy win to keep betting on Bitcoin.","article_summary":"Bitcoin tops out price records again between major ETF inflows and new offerings in the UK.

This one: Ariel Aguilar and La Bitcoineta European Edition at BTC Prague. That car is the Bitcoineta European Edition, and the cheerful guy is Ariel Aguilar. Ariel is part of the European Bitcoineta team, and has previously driven another similar car in Argentina. In fact, there are currently five cars around the world that carry the name Bitcoineta (in some cases preceded with the Spanish definite article \u201cLa\u201d). Argentina: the original La Bitcoineta The story of Bitcoinetas begins with the birth of 'La Bitcoineta' in Argentina, back in 2017. Inspired by the vibrancy of the South American Bitcoin community, the original Bitcoineta was conceived after an annual Latin American Conference (Labitconf), where the visionaries behind it recognized a unique opportunity to promote Bitcoin education in remote areas. Armed with a bright orange Bitcoin-themed exterior and a mission to bridge the gap in financial literacy, La Bitcoineta embarked on a journey to bring awareness of Bitcoin's potential benefits to villages and towns that often remained untouched by mainstream financial education initiatives. Operated by a team of dedicated volunteers, it was more than just a car; it was a symbol of hope and empowerment for those living on the fringes of financial inclusion. The concept drawing for La Bitcoineta from December 2017. Ariel was part of that initial Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and spent weeks on the road when the car became a reality. The original dream to bring bitcoin education even to remote areas within Argentina and other South American countries came true, and the La Bitcoineta team took part in dozens of local bitcoin meetups in the subsequent years. The original La Bitcoineta from Argentina. One major hiccup came in late 2018, when the car was crashed into while parked in Puerto Madryn. The car was pretty much destroyed, but since the team was possessed by a honey badger spirit, nothing could stop them from keeping true to their mission. It is a testament to the determination and resilience of the Argentinian team that the car was quickly restored and returned on its orange-pilling quest soon after. Argentinian Bitcoineta after a major accident (no-one got hurt); the car was restored shortly after. Over the more than 5 years that the Argentinian Bitcoineta has been running, it has traveled more than 80,000 kilometers - and as we\u2019ll see further, it inspired multiple similar initiatives around the world. Follow La Bitcoineta\u2019s journey: Twitter: https://twitter.com/labitcoineta Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bitcoineta/ El Salvador: Bitcoin Beach In early 2021, the president of El Salvador passed the Bitcoin Law, making bitcoin legal tender in the country. The Labitconf team decided to celebrate this major step forward in bitcoin adoption by hosting the annual conference in San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador. And correspondingly, the Argentinian Bitcoineta team made plans for a bold 7000-kilometer road trip to visit the Bitcoin country with the iconic Bitcoin car. However, it proved to be impossible to cross so many borders separating Argentina and Salvador, since many governments were still imposing travel restrictions due to a Covid pandemic. So two weeks before the November event, the Labitconf team decided to fund a second Bitcoineta directly in El Salvador, as part of the Bitcoin Beach circular economy. Thus the second Bitcoineta was born. Salvadoran\u2019s Bitcoineta operates in the El Zonte region, where the Bitcoin Beach circular economy is located. The eye-catching Volkswagen minibus has been donated to the Bitcoin Beach team, which uses the car for the needs of its circular economy based in El Zonte. Follow Bitcoin Beach: Twitter: https://twitter.com/Bitcoinbeach South Africa: Bitcoin Ekasi Late 2021 saw one other major development in terms of grassroots bitcoin adoption. On the other side of the planet, in South Africa, Hermann Vivier initiated the Bitcoin Ekasi project. \u201cEkasi\u201d is a colloquial term for a township, and a township in the South African context is an underdeveloped urban area with a predominantly black population, a remnant of the segregationist apartheid regime. Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as an attempt to introduce bitcoin into the economy of the JCC Camp township located in Mossel Bay, and has gained a lot of success on that front. Bitcoin Ekasi was in large part inspired by the success of the Bitcoin Beach circular economy back in El Salvador, and the respect was mutual. The Bitcoin Beach team thus decided to pass on the favor they received from the Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and provided funds to Bitcoin Ekasi for them to build a Bitcoineta of their own.

Hermann Vivier is seen in the background. South African Bitcoineta serves the needs of Bitcoin Ekasi, a local bitcoin circular economy in the JCC Camp township. Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as a sister organization of Surfer Kids, a non-profit organization with a mission to empower marginalized youths through surfing. The Ekasi Bitcoineta thus partially serves as a means to get the kids to visit various surfer competitions in South Africa. A major highlight in this regard was when the kids got to meet Jordy Smith, one of the most successful South African surfers worldwide. Coincidentally, South African surfers present an intriguing demographic for understanding Bitcoin due to their unique circumstances and needs. To make it as a professional surfer, the athletes need to attend competitions abroad; but since South Africa has tight currency controls in place, it is often a headache to send money abroad for travel and competition expenses. The borderless nature of Bitcoin offers a solution to these constraints, providing surfers with an alternative means of moving funds across borders without any obstacles.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Digital Currency Group, a venture capital firm, has filed a motion to dismiss a criminal suit filed against them by the New York Attorney General\u2019s office. The legal battle between DCG and the NYAG has been ongoing for several months, and is directly entangled with a dispute between two other prominent crypto firms: Genesis, a now-defunct brokerage firm, and Gemini, exchange and bank. These groups have been entangled in a series of disputes that trace back years, involving dramatic relationship changes and serious fraud accusations. A particularly relevant twist in the whole situation is the fact that the bankrupt Genesis is and has been a subsidiary of the substantially powerful DCG, which holds billions\u2019 worth of assets under management and counts ETF issuer Grayscale as another subsidiary. In other words, untangling the background for all the different players involved here is a fairly significant undertaking, especially considering the fraught environment that currently exists. Not only is the attorney general\u2019s suit directed against DCG, Genesis and Gemini in equal measure, but Genesis and Gemini have also faced off in civil suits independent of this. The NYAG accused these firms in October 2023 of collectively defrauding investors out of more than $1 billion, and the mutual recriminations involved have created a messy atmosphere. To begin, as good a place as any is a recent revelation found in court filings surrounding this dismissal. Specifically, court documents this March have made it public knowledge that Genesis and Gemini considered a merger in 2022. In 2022, DCG CEO Barry Silbert conducted a meeting with Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss over lunch, to discuss some of the motivations and logistical issues with merging the two corporate entities together. At the time, Genesis was in serious danger of bankruptcy, and its substantial partnerships with Gemini meant that the fallout would likely damage the other company\u2019s business. Gemini had lent substantial funds to Genesis as part of the Gemini Earn program, which Genesis had proceeded to lose. The hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was in charge of this money when it went belly-up in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, and Genesis was faced with a $1 billion dilemma. As for the original source of these lost funds, the NYAG has accused the firms of defrauding this money from investors. At the meeting, Silbert made the sales pitch that the two firms should combine, and that they \u201cwould be a juggernaut and would be competitive with Coinbase and FTX\u201d. He added that, even if Genesis and Gemini couldn\u2019t reach an agreement on these terms, \u201cthere is a ton more Gemini and Genesis can do together and the two companies should be leaning in together, not pulling apart\u201d. Although Winklevoss was allegedly \u201cintrigued\u201d by the proposed deal, it did not happen. Frictions, alongside Genesis\u2019 declaration of bankruptcy, arose in the immediate aftermath. A particular point of friction is found in the aforementioned Gemini Earn partnership, which made headlines this February when Genesis won a court ruling against Gemini. Essentially, Genesis owned a tranche of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares that were promised to Gemini as collateral for an exchange of money between the two companies, but Genesis declared bankruptcy before the shares could actually change hands. Since GBTC is unique among the Bitcoin spot ETFs as a pre-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, this tranche of shares had ballooned by early 2024 to be worth more than $1.2B. DCG\u2019s ownership of both Grayscale and Genesis put an extra complication over the issue. Gemini objected to Genesis\u2019 legal right to sell the shares it was promised years prior, and this began a lengthy civil suit. Although the issue was resolved through a series of settlements that allowed Genesis to make the sale and kept both it and Gemini from admitting culpability, the NYAG still filed a complaint alleging that the parties involved were all jointly guilty of substantial fraud. There were more than a billion dollars missing, and the attorney general\u2019s office was growing tired of the mutual recriminations between the relevant parties. Even if Genesis could make enough money from their sale to recoup their investors, that still doesn\u2019t address the issue of criminal activity. A particular illustration of the hostile environment came up when DCG, Genesis\u2019 parent company, disputed Genesis\u2019 own settlement with the NYAG. So, this brings us to the present day. On March 7, Silbert and DCG filed a motion to dismiss the attorney general\u2019s suit, claiming that the allegations against these companies were entirely baseless. In the motion, DCG\u2019s legal team claimed that \u201cThe allegations against DCG in this case are a thin web of baseless innuendo, blatant mischaracterizations and unsupported conclusory statements. In search of a headline-worthy scapegoat for losses caused by others, the OAG [Office of the Attorney General] wrongfully seeks to portray DCG\u2019s good-faith support of a subsidiary as participating in fraud\u201d. They specifically claim that DCG acted in good faith by funneling money towards Genesis after the Three Arrows collapse, investing \u201chundreds of millions of dollars of additional capital into its subsidiary during the months leading up to its bankruptcy, even though DCG had no obligation to do so\u201d. The attorney general took a different view, that DCG\u2019s net contributions conceal a large drain of Genesis\u2019 money at one crucial moment: DCG took their money back, Genesis declared a \u201cliquidity crunch\u201d and did not allow users to withdraw their crypto, Genesis went bankrupt immediately. The burden of proof is on them, however, to demonstrate that this was a deliberate fraud tactic. As of yet, there is no way of knowing what a judge will think of DCG\u2019s proposed defense or motion to dismiss, or if a settlement is feasible in the event that the motion to dismiss is denied. However, one unambiguously good sign has come out of the morass: Gemini announced its plans to fully reimburse the allegedly defrauded users of the Gemini Earn partnership with assets in kind. In other words, these users had Bitcoin stolen from them in 2022, and Gemini has made commitments to pay them back, accounting for Bitcoin\u2019s price jump since then. This has tacked on another $700M to the price tag of reimbursing over $1B in assets, and is a clear sign of confidence from the company. Source If nothing else, this decision to reimburse users like this is an impressive display of sincerity and good intentions from Gemini. Gemini is named as a co-defendant on all the legal documents submitted by Silbert\u2019s legal team about the NYAG suit, and would also benefit greatly from seeing the suit dismissed. This gesture of good faith might not be enough to clear the air for DCG and Genesis, but it certainly couldn\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s chances of escaping the whole fiasco without a criminal conviction. Although Gemini failed to halt Genesis\u2019 attempt at getting the money from GBTC sales, Gemini is still a successful and prominent exchange. Apparently, it was able to float a compensation of this size without relying on the GBTC tranche. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to how the suit will proceed in the coming months. When the NYAG first filed a complaint after the first round of settlements, it seemed clear that the prosecutors were quite fed up with the acerbic attitude of these former business partners. Nevertheless, Gemini\u2019s restitution plan will surely go a long way in proving their intention to do right by their users. If nothing else, it shows that they\u2019re proactive in taking the issue seriously. We\u2019ll have to observe the situation carefully as it develops, but it does seem clear that the mutual loathing and underhandedness displayed so far has not been rewarded. The broader digital asset space has periodically been filled with shaky businesses and outright scams, but eventually they all fall apart. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has come by its success legitimately. When the dust settles, the biggest winners might actually be the defrauded users, who collectively will see their expected payout nearly double thanks to Bitcoin\u2019s own strength. Compared to those kinds of gains, it\u2019s hard to imagine a scam working much better.","article_summary":"Digital Currency Group files motion to dismiss NYAG criminal suit.

In true Web3 tradition, the collection was launched by a seven-member $KARMA Council, bringing together 10 leading Ordinals communities behind $KARMA\u2019s mission. The $KARMA Council\u2019s airdrop aims to foster a sense of community amongst early Ordinals participants and bolster the burgeoning ecosystem. Strength in Numbers: Growing the Ordinals Ecosystem $KARMA is a token launched by a seven-member council, including four representatives from the OnChainMonkey (OCM) community: Soldman Gachs (@DrSoldmanGachs), Fitzy (@fitzyOG), Rabbi (@RabbiGains), and Drheref (@DrHeref). They are joined by BennyTheDev (@rarity_garden) and Alex Philippine (@Skrylabs) from Tap Protocol, bringing their technical expertise. Jason Fang (@JasonSoraVC) from Sora Ventures, a lead investor in Metagood, creators of OnChainMonkey, and the Tap Protocol is the final member of the Council. Fostering strong relationships with other communities is something that the $KARMA Council believes will be an essential step in achieving the $KARMA community\u2019s goals. Accordingly, a significant number of tokens have been earmarked for future \u2018Karmunity\u2019 Incentives. The $KARMA community incentive pot will continue to activate future partnerships or activations that will help to further expand the $KARMA and Ordinals community. This could include rewarding valuable community members, partnering with additional projects, or general growth initiatives. The Ordinals Community Airdrop With this in mind, the $KARMA Council decided to airdrop 49,968,900 $KARMA tokens to communities within the Ordinals ecosystem. This was designed to push towards $Karma Council\u2019s goal of expanding both the OCM & Ordinals ecosystems. The Council sought to take an objective selection process. For this initial airdrop, they selected the top 9 collections by market capitalization at the time of the snapshot at Block Height 828,888 (4 February 2024). The 9 communities eligible to receive $KARMA tokens in the Community Airdrop are: Bitmap (https://ordinalswallet.com/collection/bitmap) Bitcoin Punks (https://bitcoinpunks.com/) Bitcoin Puppets (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/bitcoin-puppets) Bitcoin Frogs (https://bitcoinfrogs.com/) Nodemonkes (https://nodemonkes.com/) OMB (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/omb) RSIC (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/rsic) PIPE (https://trac.network/Pipe/) TRAC (https://trac.network/) Rewarding the OCM Community A total of 560 million $KARMA tokens are being allocated to holders of OnChainMonkey NFTs. Eligibility for the OnChainMonkey community was based on assets being migrated from Ethereum to Bitcoin. Except for the OCM Karma collection (https://opensea.io/collection/karma-monkey), which has had their allocation of $KARMA reserved until that collection is upgraded to Bitcoin. Since the snapshot has not been completed for OCM Karma, people can still purchase the assets on ETH and when they migrate to Bitcoin, they will be eligible for the $KARMA airdrop. \"Trac is the governance token for Tap Protocol, the first decentralized indexer economy on the Ordinals protocol enabling similar features of ERC20 but on Bitcoin L1. The TAP standard that created $KARMA was conducted by members of the OCM community but has now expanded towards 9 other Ordinals communities,\u201d Jason Fang, founder of Sora Ventures said. \u201cTap protocol contains many more features compared to BRC20 that enables developers and projects to stake, send cost effective airdrops, and enable token distributions that make building on Bitcoin most cost effective, safer, and scalable.\u201d \"$Karma embodies the spirit of innovation and community, serving as a beacon for the next generation of decentralized ecosystems. We're thrilled to champion this groundbreaking initiative led by our OnChainMonkey community members and investors,\" remarked Amanda Terry, co-founder and COO of Metagood. \"At OnChainMonkey, we\u2019re a community of builders and innovation and impact are woven into our DNA. Just as Bitcoin revolutionized finance, $Karma is poised to redefine collaboration, economic empowerment, and impact, with strong communities early to Ordinals at its core.\u201d Technical Milestones for Airdrops The airdrop of the $KARMA tokens was performed in an efficient manner utilizing \u201cTapping,\u201d a core feature of the TAP Protocol. \u201cTapping\u201d is a process of transacting that makes it considerably cheaper and faster to distribute tokens to a large amount of addresses. Using the existing BRC-20 standard, conducting an airdrop for 61,000 wallets would have required over 122,000 transactions. The KarmaCouncil was able to complete the entire airdrop using under 55 transactions, therefore setting a precedent for the future of community inclusions for future airdrops on Bitcoin. BRC20 requires 2 transactions for a single transfer of tokens between 2 parties. The TAP Protocol allows for many transfers within 2 transactions. 1 transaction with many receivers at once and a 2nd transaction to approve the transfers (called \"tapping\"). This reduces the costs for airdrops significantly in comparison to BRC20 as there is almost half of the transactions needed. It also helps to put the Bitcoin network under less stress due to lesser amounts of transactions required. TAP Protocol's token authority feature allows it even to reduce it further using only 1 transaction, which makes it also attractive for simple individual transfers. Token authorities require additional setup configurations however, while airdrops work out of the box. A Note on Tap Protocol and the Technology Trac Core is an indexing solution (created by Trac Systems) designed to enable decentralized tracking of Ordinals metaprotocols on Bitcoin. Trac Systems is also the creator of the Tap Protocol. Creating the $KARMA tokens on the Tap Protocol was conducted by the community. Tap Protocol is a similar to BRC-20 and allows for features and hooks into DeFi that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be possible natively. In layman-terms, Tap Protocol can be seen as BRC-20 \u201con steroids\u201d. Taps airdrop feature is cheap because it combines receivers of different token types and amounts into 1 inscription. About $KARMA (https://karmacoin.xyz/) $KARMA is more than a token; it's a commitment to growth, community, and innovation. Designed as a catalyst to expand the OCM and Ordinals ecosystems, $KARMA is set to redefine engagement and opportunity for the entire Ordinals community and beyond. $KARMA is a network of founders, builders, industry leaders and seasoned collectors in the Ordinals ecosystem.

Interviewer: Hua, freelance writer, independent researcher. X: @AmelieHua Interviewee: Poly, a Controls Specialist, maintains multiple Distributed Control Systems (DCS's) and has worked with other five nine systems (99.999% uptime availability). X: @Polyd_ Covenants are an old yet fresh topic. As early as 2013, developers began discussing this topic, and in recent years, multiple BIPs aimed at implementing covenants have been proposed, sparking intense debates and making it one of the hottest topics. Covenants warrant serious discussion due to their powerful capabilities. They are considered to bring new possibilities to the programmability of Bitcoin and are believed to enable smart contracts. For Bitcoin, this is undoubtedly a double-edged sword. In this article, we will explore what covenants are, how they work, their robust functionality, and their significance for Bitcoin. While discussing details, this article often uses CTV as an example, but CTV is not the only method of implementing covenants. This article delves into the exploration of covenants but also magnifies a slice of Bitcoin under a microscope for observation. Through this observation, we can understand how Bitcoin operates at a granular level, comprehending both its capabilities and limitations. Understanding what it cannot do is as crucial as understanding what it can do because only then can we choose the right path for building on Bitcoin. 1. Hua: Before discussing covenants, clarifying two issues related to Bitcoin may be necessary, which can help us better understand covenants. We know that Bitcoin uses a scripting language, and it is known that scripting languages support the implementation of smart contracts. However, in reality, smart contracts have not been implemented on the Bitcoin main chain. This inevitably creates a sense that implementing smart contracts on Bitcoin faces some insurmountable obstacles, and it seems impossible on the Bitcoin network. However, many people may not be aware that although Bitcoin can be programmed using a scripting language, the set of opcodes is extremely limited. This limited set of opcodes restricts the programmability scope of Bitcoin, meaning that, although the scripting language can implement smart contracts, programmers do not have sufficient \"tools\" to implement smart contracts. Poly: Definitely, Bitcoin Script can be considered limiting as it can only perform the basic operations such as making simple payments. Some of the reasons that people may find it \u201climiting\u201d is that it doesn\u2019t have a global state, it\u2019s not considered turing complete, it uses a UTXO-based system (which has \u201cvalue blindness\u201d) instead of an account-based system. The last big reason is that very little data from the blockchain itself can be integrated into contracts causing blockchain-blindness. This has created a lot of challenges over the years as people have worked around these limitations. We\u2019ve also had a semantic shift with the term \u201csmart contract\u201d to mean one specific thing when you should consider the lightning network a production of many smart contracts formed by many individuals. Those multi-sigs with hashlocks and timelocks are not only smart contracts, but also have time-based covenants. The problem is, just as you mentioned before, because Bitcoin only has simple opcodes to perform just the basics, if you attempt to scale beyond two people in a smart contract, you can get either a lot of bloat for an on-chain footprint or the things you want to do just might not be possible. This strict limitation comes from a few places, I think the biggest being that when the inflation bug occurred back in 2010, Satoshi had disabled a whole list of higher order opcodes including OP_CAT which would\u2019ve allowed us to create more dynamic smart contracts via transaction introspection. BCH has since overcome this limitation within their own script, showing that Script isn\u2019t as weak as everyone assumes, just that Bitcoin has always been slower due to its decentralization and coordination is near impossible except over long periods of time. We\u2019ve also barely touched on Taproot and Tapscript which will alleviate a lot of the footprint concerns and allows for new behaviors such as BitVM by rolling up the contract into the signature and you only reveal as necessary. Hua: Why are there strict limitations on opcodes? Can you use OP_CAT as an example to help us understand this point? Poly: So OP_CAT is deceptively simple, it will take two strings and add them together. It was originally disabled because it had resource issues and could be used to cause nodes to crash, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the full story as Satoshi set the 520 byte stack limit and disabled OP_CAT in the same commit so there could be more to it than just simple resource exhaustion. But just to give a short list of what OP_CAT can perform: CTV/TXHASH covenants, verify SPV proofs, double-spend protection for 0-conf TXs, 64-bit arithmetic, vaults, quantum-resistant signatures. The list goes on, with OP_CAT alone, it can emulate both CTV[CheckTemplateVerify] and TXHASH style transactions. The only issue is it\u2019s highly inefficient in the manner that it performs these actions that might be possible, but that could just preclude these transactions from being desirable except by users of scale such as custodians. 2. Hua: Let's talk about another \"limitation\" of Bitcoin. Bitcoin only supports \"verification\" as a form of computation and can't do general-purpose computation. We also know that, for example, smart contracts on Ethereum contain rules for state transitions. It completes the state transition through computation, enabling the functionality of smart contracts. In comparison, Bitcoin can't do general-purpose computation, meaning it cannot achieve state transitions through computation on its own. Is my understanding correct? Poly: Yeah, I\u2019d agree that\u2019s a simple summary of the current state of things. Bitcoin could be made to support computational transactions and the line can become quite thin when covenants and state transitions are involved, but those proposals aren\u2019t as well researched and might not be something that\u2019s considered desirable. I\u2019m actually not that much of a fan of the way Ethereum does things. Due to it being computational in nature with the verification built on-top, if I attempt to perform a trade, my window could shift and I could \u201cfail to trade\u201d but the transaction for the attempt to trade was still valid so i still paid for fees which wasted my money on what i\u2019d want to consider a failed transaction and wasted blockspace for someone else. Another weird aspect are the Oracles in Ethereum. Oracles must pay gas to update their oracle prices whereas in Bitcoin DLC\u2019s, the Oracle are blinded and are just providing a signature and can\u2019t be \u201cpinned\u201d due to a change in fees nor can Oracles target specific contracts. Earlier I discussed all the downsides to the UTXO model compared to the account model and global state model, but what allows the UTXO model to shine is parallelism. The only concern you have is the child transactions to the same UTXO, nothing else matters, this allows the system to scale much better. 3. Hua: Let's start discussing covenants now. What are covenants? Poly: Covenants usually refer to restrictions on how coins can be transferred. The word covenant seems to carry some sort of connotation with it so it helps to demystify it and explain it as simple locking mechanisms you can place only on your *own* coin. We have two covenants already inside Bitcoin and they power the Lightning Network, CSV [CheckSequenceVerify] and CLTV [CheckLockTimeVerify]. Some just call these opcodes \u201csmart contract primitives\u201d as they\u2019re simple time locks, but they can also be classified as time covenants. CTV [CheckTemplateVerify] is a proposed Bitcoin upgrade and is included in BIP 119. It is different from CSV and CLTV, you can think of CTV as a \u201cTXID [Transaction ID] lock\u201d or \u201cUTXO lock\u201d, only these TXID\u2019s can be made from this lock. For CTV, we refer to this TXID lock as \u201cEquality Covenants\u201d as the resulting transactions must equal to the original transactions that were committed. It\u2019s also called a deferred commitment covenant, as you can see that your UTXO has been committed to, but it isn\u2019t yet placed on-chain. The most known alternative is SH_APO [Any Previous Out or AnyPrevOut] which focuses on the payout commitment being ensured while allowing the pay-in method to be flexible. A few others discussed are OP_CCV [also known as MATT], OP_EXPIRE, TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY. Hua: When you mention \"covenants usually refer to restrictions on how coins can be transferred,\" can I understand it like this: Covenants are a method of specifying how funds can be used, or in other words, it's a way of restricting where funds can be spent. Poly: Yep, it effectively earmarks the UTXO to be distributed in a specific manner, once you commit to it, you can't take it back, it's now consensus bound, and only its new owner can decide how to spend their funds. When a UTXO is created on-chain, our instinct is to assume that a single private key is holding that UTXO in place. But if it was a CTV bound UTXO, when the UTXO is spent, you'll see an extra 32 byte hash paired with the new transaction that represents the hidden state that was inside the original UTXO. Hua: You've mentioned \"TXID lock/UTXO lock\" multiple times. Can I understand it like this: To understand how CTV achieves their functionality, we need to understand what TXID lock is and how it works. TXID lock is a key mechanism. Poly: Yes, It creates a strong foundation to build further schemes. The TXID is determined by the contents of a tx. And if you can add inputs to a tx, you can manipulate the TXID. CTV makes you lock the number of inputs and outputs. This is how we ensure that CTV commitments are trustless, if the TXID could be malleable, you could potentially be able to steal someone\u2019s funds. Once you have a TXID locking mechanism, you combine it with other locking mechanisms such as the time locks to build even greater smart contracts. 4. Hua: Why do you think covenants are a rabbit hole? Poly: I call covenants a rabbit hole because there\u2019s so much you can do with simple restrictions on transactions such as a time lock or a TXID lock. We\u2019ve managed to build the entire Lightning network with simple time locks and while it isn\u2019t perfect, it is the only truly decentralized L2 in existence. I don\u2019t like how it\u2019s slowly shifting towards being custodial focused, but that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019ve started down this rabbit hole to begin with: To make our smart contracts more powerful. We refer to the TXID lock as a Template. With Taproot, we gained the ability to have signature aggregation. With Templates and CTV, we gain the ability to have transaction aggregation. CTV serves as a replacement for a pre-signed transaction oracle, which eliminates the trust and interactivity requirements needed to create more sophisticated smart contracts that are needed for things like vaults and payment pools. The vaults and payment pools that you can make with CTV are technically possible today, but currently they\u2019re precluded by the trust or interactivity needed to make it work. Moreover, with CTV, we can build channel factories, additional layer 2 solutions such as Ark, Timeout-Trees, Stakechains or Surfchains, and JIT fidelity bond solutions such as PathCoin. Probably my favorite feature is Non-Interactive Channels [NIC\u2019s] that we\u2019ve also been referring to as Cold Channels. The basic idea is to take a normal lightning channel and simply place it in a CTV template. What makes this different from a normal lightning channel is that neither party actually needed to be online to create this channel. So if I need a channel with another person, I don\u2019t need them to be online to create it, I don\u2019t even need to tell them I made it until I\u2019m ready to spend from it! This allows for cold storage capability on lightning because I don\u2019t need a watchtower nor a node to safeguard my funds in any channels that aren\u2019t yet active. Third-party coordinators can also establish NIC\u2019s for two individuals so there\u2019s a lot of flexibility in what\u2019s possible. As it stands, CTV won\u2019t allow you to build a DEX on-chain, but I\u2019m not sure if that is such a bad thing as people are currently trying to build DEX\u2019s off-chain using the Lightning Network as it is today. I think this ties back into the \u201cVerification vs Computation\u201d discussion, how much do you really want on-chain versus how much do you need to verify on-chain. One concern I have about on-chain DEX\u2019s, besides the excessive on-chain updates driving higher fees, is MEV. We\u2019ve already spotted some MEV from BCH\u2019s DEX\u2019s transactions and as the market matures, this is bound to get worse. Hua: Can you give an example to help us understand how CTV works? Poly: Let\u2019s say I am expecting to receive 5 BTC, as of right now, the only thing I can do is receive the payment and verify it on-chain. With CTV, I can commit to future addresses or to people and reduce it down to a simple pubkey that I give to my payer to pay me. They don\u2019t know the details of it so it remains private to everyone but me. Once I can confirm that they\u2019ve paid me, all of the actions I took using the CTV template have now also taken effect. So if I had elected to create a channel with Bob, once Alice pays me, the channel with Bob is now committed, even though the channel with Bob is nowhere to be seen on-chain, it is only accessible by my template and the transaction that Alice had created. It\u2019s only known to me until I share the channel details with Bob. Once I do share the details with Bob, we can use the channel as normal. When we cooperatively close the channel, instead of needing to place an open channel details on-chain, we just place the closing channel on-chain. This allows us to perform transaction cut-through, reducing the total number of transactions that need to be on-chain by at least half for layer 2 solutions. The opening portion only needs a commitment, what we really care about are the closing details. If this was a shared UTXO with multiple people, we could collaborate to close our transactions together as well, reducing the number of on-chain transactions even further. 5. Hua: As you mentioned before, we can introduce different opcodes to implement covenants. Poly: So if we re-introduced OP_CAT, I think it would allow for nearly every type of covenant possible as you can emulate any form of introspection for TXHASH. The more limited method would be to introduce opcodes representing the explicit behavior desired like with CTV, CSFS or CheckSeperateSignature. CTV is the ability to do deferred outputs. CSFS is the ability to do deferred signatures so you can defer the payment itself. They sound similar and in fact they work well together as building blocks to enable LN-Symmetry, but the commitments are happening at different levels. TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY both enable introspection and serve the same purpose, but TEMPLATE KEY uses a single-byte mode while TXHASH uses multi-byte flags. This allows for much more powerful capabilities inside script and smart contracts, but many are concerned about the side effects it could have. TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY are more of a CTVv2, something that would make CTV more powerful and expressive. Hua: I've noticed that there doesn't seem to be a significant disagreement about whether to support the implementation of covenants. However, in comparison, there seems to be more significant divergence among people regarding which method or set of opcodes to add to implement covenants. Poly: I think a large part is there\u2019s different camps of thought. There\u2019s a lot of the lack of understanding the intent behind each proposal as they have different goals in mind and are designed in completely different ways. A lot of developers have only had their eye on Lightning and how it\u2019s to evolve, they tend to favor opcodes like SH_APO since it enables LN-Symmetry. For a lot of developers that don\u2019t particularly like Lightning due to its limitations such as Inbound Liquidity constraints or the requirement to be online, they tend to favor opcodes like OP_CAT, TXHASH as more expressive scaling solutions. The developers that prefer CTV are more neutral and are looking at it from a systems point of view, it doesn\u2019t necessarily do any one thing perfectly but it greatly enhances everyone\u2019s ability to do their preferred thing, whatever it may be without introducing risks that can\u2019t be measured since it doesn\u2019t introduce introspection. 6. Hua: Before discussing covenants, we talked about issues related to opcodes in scripting language and the problem of limited computation leading to state transition. We already know the relationship between covenants and opcodes. Now, let's delve into the issue of state transition. I'm not sure if looking at covenants from the perspective of \"state transition\" is correct, but this perspective truly fascinates me. Without covenants, the scripting language's main function is to retrieve transactions' signatures and verify them. The transaction can only be completed when the private key is correct, and there is no intermediate state. With covenants, a transaction can be completed when certain conditions are met. Moreover, a transaction can only be completed when specific conditions are satisfied (not just the correctness of the private key). Can we understand it this way: Covenants indirectly provide conditions for state transition. Poly: The covenant is the template shell or the \"state\". Inside of it, you're going to need to make time locks and other functions to enable the desired functionality that you\u2019re wanting, be that a vault, lightning channel or some other layer 2 solution. So CTV allows for the state creation to occur, but you have to dynamically rebuild the state at each transition to keep it in homeostasis, we call this meta-recursive. Whereas something like SH_APO allows you to create a state and then periodically update that state, making it recursive. CTV can also create a chain of transactions that would allow you to \u201cstep-through\u201d that state. A good example to think about is Ark, it\u2019s a giant smart contract, almost like a giant coinjoin and the one running the protocol creates a new state [or rounds as it\u2019s called] every few seconds to facilitate participants to pay others as needed. Once the Ark operator is ready, they will send a transaction to the mempool to commit the current state to on-chain. These on-chain placeholders can be thought of as the \u201ctransition states.\u201d The operator has to constantly recompute new states to present to the Ark participants and what\u2019s sent to on-chain is the verification of that state. Hua: Can we understand it this way: Covenants implement a form of smart contract based on verification rather than computation? Poly: Yes. Definitely. This smart contract is just comparing a transaction to an associated sha256 hash. Block speed verification would actually increase since there\u2019s no signature operations. Hua: One direction of development for blockchains is modularity, including off-chain computation. However, Bitcoin seems naturally designed for off-chain computation, appearing behind but actually leading the way. What do you think? Poly: Time is a flat circle. It\u2019s crazy how it seems like we\u2019ve come full circle to what\u2019s wanted in a blockchain. Bitcoin still seems to have some modularity issues and footprint issues. I wish we had better side-chains that weren\u2019t simply multi-sig solutions and used actual cryptographic means to secure one\u2019s funds and allowed for Unilateral Exits. I think that would help push the boundaries on Bitcoin\u2019s modularity. Taproot has allowed for even more off-chain computation with things such as BitVM, which would allow us to compute almost anything off-chain. But unfortunately, it can\u2019t emulate things inside Bitcoin such as CTV so it seems we still have progress to make. 7. Hua: What possibilities can be achieved by combining covenants with other opcodes like DLC? Poly: So DLC\u2019s have a few problems that would be fixed with covenants such as increasing the flexibility of the parameters of the DLC by making many price points [if we\u2019re wagering on the price of something such as Bitcoin]. Another one is that hardware wallets [HWW] can\u2019t interact with a lot of DLC\u2019s, the signing rounds for DLCs and attempting to do it with HWWs causes DLCs to take several minutes to open. With CTV, this delay to enter a DLC can be reduced down to seconds. 8. Hua: Are there any other points you'd like to introduce to the readers? Poly: We went over a lot of concepts. We touched on how it can be used to mitigate excessive blockspace demand and potential ddos attacks. We discussed how people could save space by making Non-Interactive Channels. I think another good one to discuss is the \"L2 exit problem\". If we managed to get everyone off of the L1 layer and get them onto a large L2, there's currently no good way to get people off that L2 in an expedited manner. We could think of that L2 as Lightning [we call the potential mass exodus on Lightning, the \"Thundering Herd problem\u201d], or we could think of Coinbase, Binance or Liquid as the L2. There are people who hold claims to Bitcoin, but their only way to actually acquire that claim is by submitting a transaction to get it placed on-chain. There's millions of people on Coinbase, I have no idea how to get them off of there and onto Bitcoin in any orderly fashion in today's environment. There would be a mempool backlog of 6 months attempting to get people off the exchange. CTV can fix this. Make an Ark or a Timeout-Tree with CTV. The exchange could even offer the service directly. Everyone could be offloaded from the original \"shared UTXO\" that was under Coinbase's consensus and pushed into a \"shared UTXO\" with a consensus of their choice, be it a simple pool or a large Timeout-Tree. This is where it really wrinkles the brain, this was a pure L2 <> L2 conversion. There was no intermediary step requiring me to go down to L1 first. And I can continue repeating this process indefinitely, using any layer of my choice. There isn\u2019t a need to return to the base layer unless I was forced there such as from an uncooperative closeout from my channel or perhaps an unvaulting from my vault. The Ark and Timeout-Tree pitfall is that they have rollover requirements, you have to move your funds every few weeks or months or you forfeit your funds. This isn\u2019t an ideal solution for long-term funds but works great for any short term holdings and larger markets. I'd like to provide a full list of every concept that\u2019s been developed using CTV and its ability to simply aggregate pre-signed transactions: Non-Interactive Channels, Timeout-Trees, Ark, Darkpools, Payment Pools, Payment Channels, Ball Lightning, Congestion Control, Dpool's, Compaction, Tree Swaps, PathCoin, Stakechains, Surfchains. But don\u2019t think of these as all independent Templates, if there\u2019s a feature of one that you wish to include in another, you can create your own custom Template to try and find your desired behavior.

Without this, in one way or another, you are relinquishing control of your money to someone else. \u201cNot your keys, not your coins\u201d as the saying goes. A counter-intuitive aspect of Bitcoin for people who aren\u2019t familiar with the technical underpinnings of it is \u201cwhere\u201d your Bitcoin actually is. When people think of a wallet, they think \u201cthe place where I keep my money.\u201d Your bitcoin wallet doesn\u2019t actually \u201chold\u201d your Bitcoin, it just stores your private keys. Your Bitcoin is just entries of data on the blockchain hosted by everyone participating in the network. When you go to spend your bitcoin, what you are actually doing is proposing an update to the data stored on the blockchain. A private key is how the protocol ensures that you, and you alone, can authorize an update to the blockchain that spends your Bitcoin. So what are your private keys? Just very large numbers. Extremely large. This is a private key in binary: 1110001011011001011110111100000101000100000010001001111010111011010101110111001111111111101010111010010111010011101001110010100110111101000110000111110101111001101001011110011011101000001101101101110001101000110001111010001001001111011010101011001101101010 256 random 1s and 0s. This random number is what ultimately secures your Bitcoin. It might not look like much, but its randomness is what ensures your wallet\u2019s security. There are almost as many possible Bitcoin private keys as there are atoms in the visible universe. That is how many numbers a computer would have to count through to generate and catalog all the private keys potentially possible. As long as the process used to generate the keys is truly random, your keys are safe. This is what a private key looks like in hexadecimal (binary uses two digits to encode a number, 1 and 0, hexadecimal uses 16 digits, 0-9 and A-F): E2D97BC144089EBB5773FFABA5D3A729BD187D79A5E6E836DC68C7A24F6AB36A This is what a private key looks like in uncompressed Wallet Import Format (WIF): 5KYC9aMMSDWGJciYRtwY3mNpeTn91BLagdjzJ4k4RQmdhQvE98G WIF format is how everyone used to interact with their private keys in the early days of Bitcoin. In this era, you could generate one private key at a time, and then you\u2019d generate the public key from that. The process of generating a public key is essentially just the multiplication of very large numbers but there is a bit more to it than that.. All public keys are an x and y point on a graph showing a very, very large curve that loops back on itself. On the graph curve, in Bitcoin\u2019s case Secp256k1, there is a point called the \u201cgenerator point.\u201d This generator point can be thought of as the \u201cbase point\u201d on the Secp256k1 curve. It is integral to the process of generating keys and signing with them. This is what the generator point is for Bitcoin\u2019s curve: G = 02 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798 To generate the public key from your private key, you take the private key you generated and multiply it by the generator point. That\u2019s it. This now establishes a point on the graph with a mathematical relationship to the private key you generated that only you know. This is an uncompressed public key showing both x and y points: 04C0E410A572C880D1A2106AFE1C6EA2F67830ABCC8BBDF24729F7BF3AFEA06158F0C04D7335D051A92442330A50B8C37CE0EC5AFC4FFEAB41732DA5108261FFED It is very common to \u201ccompress\u201d public keys in the rare chance you interact with them to just store the x coordinate with a byte to tell you whether the y coordinate is negative or positive. That shortens it considerably: 04C0E410A572C880D1A2106AFE1C6EA2F67830ABCC8BBDF24729F7BF3AFEA06158F0C04D7335D051A92442330A50B8C37CE0EC5AFC4FFEAB41732DA5108261FFED When you go to sign a transaction with your private key, it once again boils down to essentially just multiplication. By generating a random number (the nonce), and using that and your private key to essentially multiply the hash of the transaction you are signing, you produce the signature (which is made up of two values, r, and S). This allows someone to run an algorithm to verify the message was signed by the appropriate private key without revealing that key. The thing guaranteeing only you can authorize spending your Bitcoin is essentially just the multiplication of very, very large numbers. If you aren\u2019t all that familiar with these concepts before reading this, all of this probably seems somewhat intimidating. Binary? Hexadecimal? Graph points? How do you back up a WIF? Since the development of more intuitive ways of handling this data, most users are unfamiliar with these complicated formats. Most likely, you have more experience with word seeds, also known as seed phrases. BIP 39 Mnemonic Seeds Mnemonic seeds, or seed phrases, were created to address the problem of the experience of interacting with your private keys. As we discussed earlier, private keys are ultimately just a long series of 1s and 0s that are randomly generated. Imagine trying to create copies of this and ensure you didn\u2019t make an error transcribing it: 1110001011011001011110111100000101000100000010001001111010111011010101110111001111111111101010111010010111010011101001110010100110111101000110000111110101111001101001011110011011101000001101101101110001101000110001111010001001001111011010101011001101101010 All it would take is a single error copying one digit to render a backup of your keys useless. This is where mnemonic seeds come in handy. 256 consecutive 1s and 0s in a row is not a human-friendly way to interact with sensitive information. Recording this number incorrectly means losing access to your account. truck renew fury donkey remind laptop reform detail split grief because fat That is much easier to deal with, isn\u2019t it? Just 12 words. So how does that work, going from a bunch of random 1s and 0s to a string of words that actually make sense to you? An encoding scheme, just like binary or hexadecimal! Each of those 12 words in that mnemonic seed above is a binary number in an encoding scheme mapping specific strings of 1s and 0s to words. If we look back at the WIF private key example earlier, that was simply a number encoded in a specific encoding scheme, in that case, base 58, which uses every number and letter of the alphabet except 0 and 1, and O and l (case sensitive). The exclusion of those characters was done specifically to make transcription errors unlikely by confusing a 1 for an l, or a 0 for an O. bech32 and bech32m used by Segwit and Taproot take this to the next level by using only this set of characters (qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l). Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 (BIP 39), introduced a standardized encoding scheme where each word in a specially crafted dictionary is alphabetically mapped to a binary number from 00000000001 to 11111111111. The demonstration seed above maps to this: truck: 11101001001 renew: 10110110001 fury: 01011110011 donkey: 01000001001 remind: 10110101110 laptop: 01111101000 reform: 10110100010 detail: 00111100010 split: 11010010001 grief: 01100110100 because: 00010011110 fat: 01010011011 In just binary it looks like this: 11101001001 10110110001 01011110011 01000001001 10110101110 01111101000 10110100010 00111100010 11010010001 01100110100 00010011110 0101001 1011 There are 2048 words, each mapped to a specific 11 digit string of 1s and 0s, specifically to make it easier for people to interact with their private keys. When you generate a random number for your private key, your wallet cuts that number up into chunks of 11 digit binary numbers and maps them to the BIP 39 Mnemonic dictionary. It\u2019s still the same large number, but now you can read it as English words. Since your brain is much more accustomed to this format than long strings of 1s and 0s, this drastically reduces the odds of you writing down something wrong and losing your Bitcoin in the process. You may have noticed that in the raw binary encoding of the word seed above, there are four digits (1011) sitting off on their own, and the last \u201cword\u201d is only actually 8 digits. That is a checksum to ensure that a seed phrase is valid. When you generate your random number, there aren\u2019t enough digits to map it exactly to 12 (or 24) words. The wallet hashes those existing digits you generated and takes the first few digits of the hash to add on to the end of your random number. This gives you enough digits to map to the last word. This last word allows you to perform a safety check on copies of your seed. If you enter your mnemonic seed into a wallet incorrectly, the checksum will not match. Each 12 or 24 word seed has multiple potential valid checksum words, but if the last word doesn\u2019t match the checksum of a correct seed your wallet will warn you it is invalid. This gives people an intuitive yet still mathematical way to guarantee their backups are correct, unlike the messy process of transcribing and backing up the raw binary numbers. The selection of the specific words on the list even went so far as to guarantee that none of the 2048 words have the same first four letters. This was done to reduce the likelihood of people making transcription errors by confusing similar words and winding up with an incorrect backup of their private keys. Translating these words into a set of multiple private/public keys is quite simple. Your mnemonic seed is taken and hashed using SHA512, which outputs a hash of 512 individual 1s and 0s. Half of that output is used as an actual private key, and the other half is used as input to SHA512 with an index number and the existing private or public key to generate a new key pair. You can do this as many times as you want to generate new private/public keys that can all be recovered from your single mnemonic phrase. This ensures that you can manage your private keys as easily, and safely, as possible with the lowest odds of making a mistake that loses your money. And all of it was done using math! Hopefully, now you have a good understanding of why people say that Bitcoin is money \u2018secured by math.\u2019","article_summary":"How large numbers and randomness secure your bitcoin, and what your seed phrase has to do with it.

History has shown us time and again that centralized control inevitably devolves into tyranny, eroding the foundations of liberty upon which free societies are built. The 10 planks of communism, as outlined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in The Communist Manifesto, that serves as the blueprint for transitioning society to a collectivist system cannot be implemented without centralization first occurring; due to the fact that communism at its core seeks to abolish every form of private ownership while enthroning the state as master of all. The sad reality is that these planks have been gradually implemented over the years by most countries in the world, thus progressively eroding free markets and the overall liberty of their citizens. The centralization of speech online is the most recent threat that has emerged as a potent tool for state control. Ironically, this phenomenon resembles the realization of plank 6 of the communist manifesto, which advocates for the \"centralization of the Means of Communication and Transport in the Hands of the State.\" As commerce and communications via online platforms grows, these two very important aspects of human existence become centralized in the hands of the big tech companies that own these platforms. In our cancel culture driven world, the increasing overlap between centralized social media platforms and financial services has significantly increased the risk of absolute censorship; where violating the constantly changing \"community guidelines\" can lead to one becoming persona non grata and being immediately deplatformed. Without decentralized alternatives, censoring any speech or transaction that is deemed \u201cundesirable\u201d becomes a trivial matter. Big tech social media giants acting as the de facto thought police and enforcers for the state, wield immense influence over the flow of information, and suppress every form of dissent through the threat of financial strangulation when one doesn\u2019t toe the line. There are two major factors that undergird this power to silence dissent online: Centralized nature of the social media platforms Centralized payment processors like PayPal that dominate these platforms For individuals who rely on social media for their livelihood, deplatforming represents a significant threat, not only to their ability to express themselves freely but also to their income. Self-censorship naturally becomes the norm and this is even more dangerous as it creates the illusion of alignment with the current thing of the day. Thankfully, Bitcoin has made these payment processors irrelevant and due to it being fully decentralized, neutral, apolitical and censorship resistant; it\u2019s a viable alternative. Code is Speech In 2013 Cody Wilson, the pioneer of the world's first 3-D printable gun, received a letter from the State Department demanding removal of blueprints for his plastic firearm, the Liberator, or risk facing jail time and millions in fines. In 2015 Wilson's organization, Defense Distributed, filed a lawsuit against the State Department, alleging that prohibiting the publication of his plans, which are essentially computer code, constitutes a prior restraint of free speech rights, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US constitution. The dispute revolved around the State Department\u2019s claim that posting 3-D printable gun files online constitutes a potential breach of arms export controls, a controversial set of regulations known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The history of ITAR has been marred by controversy and contention. In the 90s, it was used to target cryptographers (aka cypherpunks), classifying strong encryption tools as military munitions. After the source code for PGP was released and printed out as a book, it immediately fell under First Amendment protection. Despite this seemingly obvious fact, its inventor Phil Zimmermann, was subjected to a grueling three-year Department Of Justice (DOJ) investigation during these Crypto Wars, which was subsequently put to bed without any indictments. In 1995 cryptographer Dan Bernstein also sued the DOJ, arguing ITAR violated his First Amendment rights, and won the case. This was the landmark case that designated code as speech. Despite the State Department's two-year enforcement of ITAR against Defense Distributed, it failed to stop the proliferation of its 3-D printable gun files online. Instead, concerns over censorship spurred over 100,000 downloads of the Liberator blueprint in just two days! Despite removal from Defense Distributed\u2019s websites, the file quickly spread to platforms like the Pirate Bay, making erasure nearly impossible. Attempts to ban speech in the digital age are not only absurd but futile because of its ability to manifest in infinite forms.The historical example of RSA's classification as munition highlights the futility of restricting information as epitomized by printing forbidden information on t-shirts. Information must be free. Export-controlled RSA encryption source code on a T-shirt turned the shirt into a restricted munition. In an interview I had with Jessica Solce, the film maker and executive producer of Death Athletic: A Dissident Architecture a documentary that profiled Cody Wilson and the 3D-printed guns movement; when commenting on the significance of Cody\u2019s battle with the government she said, \u201cCody entangled the First and Second Amendment by pushing guns into the digital era. He utilized the burgeoning technology of 3D printing to reduce a gun to code. This WikiWeapon, the Liberator, was directly inspired by Wikileaks, and immediately threatened the Government\u2019s axis of power and control. It was a masterful play that antagonized the military complex and forced the conversation of gun control into the age of the Internet.\u201d In other words, Wilson didn\u2019t just challenge the military industrial complex\u2019s monopolization (i.e., centralization) of firearms manufacturing. His stance extended to firmly resisting instances of government overreach that sought to regulate and control information pertaining to emerging technologies, which in and of itself is another form of centralized control. A condition which George Orwell described in his book 1984 as, \u201can endless present in which the party is always right\u201d. Interestingly Jessica also encountered firm resistance from centralized content distributors and media outlets when the film was released, as it definitely didn\u2019t fit the \u201capproved narrative\u201d because on the surface it looks like a film about guns but it\u2019s really a story about the power of free speech and free access to information in the internet age. Clearly the time is ripe for more decentralized content distribution and streaming services that are integrated with Bitcoin payments, think Angel Studios on a Bitcoin standard. This will empower content creators to not only profit from captivating content while simultaneously challenging centralized control over information, ensuring artistic creative control, prioritizing truth, and preservation of free speech., but I digress. In July 2018, three years after Defense Distributed challenged the State Department\u2019s actions in court, they accepted a settlement offer from the State Department, including a license to publish its files and a payment of nearly $40,000. When questioned about the settlement, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert justified the decision, stating that the Department of Justice advised settling the case to avoid likely loss on First Amendment grounds in court. Information must be free. This and many other ongoing legal battles faced by Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed underscore important aspects of individual rights and freedom of speech that must be defended. These battles serve as a reminder that: The state seeks to control and capture new technologies by \u201cany means necessary\u201d Lawfare and bureaucracy are the weapons of choice in achieving this aim More decentralized technological tools and protocols that incorporate Bitcoin as the monetary layer need to be built to ensure the preservation of liberty and individual sovereignty. Jessica echoed similar sentiments when stating one of the biggest takeaways that she hopes people will get from Cody\u2019s story; \u201cThe takeaway is to build however you can - community, resources, decentralized systems, archive history and information. The battle for information, the era of the Internet and the battle for its control must be understood as a type of new frontier. Many are against second amendment rights so I\u2019d ask them are they truly against the free and open dissemination of information as well? Do they like someone telling them what they are able and not able to understand and read?\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. Decoding Free Speech in the Digital Age Just like PGP or Cody\u2019s 3D-printable gun designs, Bitcoin at its core is fundamentally open source code, thus Bitcoin is speech. In the words of Beautyon,\u201cThere is no point in any Bitcoin transaction that Bitcoin ceases to be text. It is all text, all the time.\u201d The ruling in the Bernstein v. The DOJ case set a precedent that recognized code as protected speech under the First Amendment, and therefore this protection also directly applies to Bitcoin. Fundamentally, Bitcoin is a messaging system and functions much like email and text messaging, all of which transmit messages. Its primary aim is to definitively confirm an owner's control over a cryptographic key, represented as a block of text, enabling access to a corresponding entry in the global Bitcoin network ledger. The point here is that restriction of communication using programming languages is an example of a prior restraint of speech. Attempts to ban Bitcoin are just as ludicrous as banning memorizing 12 words in your head or outlawing certain musical scores .Does this mean that the powers that be will not try to outlaw Bitcoin and increase their grip on the narrative through censorship? You bet they will! Just like they have declared war on free speech online by rebranding it as a war on \u201cmisinformation and disinformation\u201d, propaganda is also being disseminated by the corporate media that paints Bitcoin mining in particular, as being harmful to the environment, a claim that has been repeatedly debunked along with the usual \u201cBitcoin is for money launderers and criminals\u201d Time fails me to discuss the latest proposed FinCen regulations and the EU\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law which are all very subtle but sinister attempts to gradually cripple Bitcoin in the name of combating money laundering and enforcing know your customer policies.. In the same vein, digital ID\u2019s and central bank digital currencies (CBDC\u2019s), are more than just surveillance tech; but are also weapons for destroying free speech and independent thought. The ultimate road to serfdom. While legal challenges against all these forms of government overreach noted above will be launched and likely won, they take a long time to settle and are usually very costly. The best solution is to develop more open-source, decentralized technological tools that will thwart and defang any attempts by the state to censor speech. As big tech companies pay lip service to freedom of speech while simultaneously implementing \u201cfreedom of speech not reach policies, online discourse increasingly mirrors the authoritarian control described by Ludwig von Mises when he said: \u201cAt every instant of his life the \"comrade\" is bound to obey implicitly the orders issued by the supreme authority. The State is both his guardian and his employer. The State determines his work, his diet, and his pleasures. The State tells him what to think and what to believe in\u201d. This is even more true today, than it was in 1944 when it was written. Without the freedom of speech we lose a critical part of what it means to be free human beings. Today we may witness the battles between Defense Distributed and the State Department, Wikileaks and the DOJ, Bernstein and the DOJ, and so on. However, one thing remains clear: the players may change, and the time frames may differ, but the underlying struggle has always been centralization versus decentralization, a battle between those who seek to control speech and those who seek to liberate it. Satoshi Nakamoto, Julian Assange, Aaron Schwartz and many others are some of the martyrs of freedom that contributed immensely to the preservation of free speech in our society today. Bitcoin is the best shot that we have at safeguarding the future from being suffocated by the censorship industrial complex leviathan. This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

So nostalgia is the suffering caused by an unappeased yearning to return.\u201d \u2015 Milan Kundera, Ignorance Nostalgia is a powerful emotion. A coping mechanism, an inspiration, or a manipulative rhetorical tool. For quite some time, the inhabitants of the West have found themselves conscripted onto a battlefield of the mind. Society has been reshaping itself or being reshaped at a frenetic pace for decades now. Nostalgia has proven itself to be a potent weapon in the arsenals of every faction on that battlefield. The power of contrast should never be underestimated. Humans are living, breathing, pattern-recognition machines. We cannot help but compare proposed plans and present circumstances to historical outcomes. This is normal, this is healthy: It lets the human mind achieve some measure of confidence in predicting what happens next. The human mind loathes unpredictability more than anything else. The unknown noise in the dark is far more terrifying than the wild animal on the ridgeline that you can observe and predict. The regime knows that contrast holds such power, because it allows for critique. Such was the power of Florida during COVID, for instance. Without a state that was free of lockdowns and mandates, foisting the same circumstances on an entire population across the board would have caused less negative sentiment of those measures. This was the real reason for the mass psychosis and peer pressure of that era. It\u2019s much more difficult to make someone take a bite of a turd sandwich insistently offered to them when there are other options.

Millennials stand astride the old world before 9/11 and the new one, with memories of a higher-trust society with much more prosperity and unity than what we have now. These feelings are amplified by the fact that due to their age, the entirety of the era before the shift was viewed through the rose-colored glasses of childhood. Essentially, millennials are too young to remember the 1992 L.A. riots or the Oklahoma City bombing with any sense of clarity or context, but old enough to remember when innocence was valued and optimism about the future was commonplace. This contrast between a less anxious past and a present that consists of never-ending psychological warfare can be many things. The past can be pointed to as a critique of how far we have fallen and thrown in the faces of the ruling order as dissent. It can also be a coping mechanism, both healthy and unhealthy. From vaporwave to homesteading, from filtered edits of 1980s Miami to thinking about the Roman empire, the aesthetics and contrast of the past are coming back with a vengeance as the present is too Lovecraftian to personify. My personal favorite example of this has been the meteoric resurgence of the band Creed. While the band broke up in 2004, they have miraculously been memed back to life. A video of the 2001 Thanksgiving halftime show they performed in Dallas went viral. Taking place just two months after 9/11, that snapshot in time captured and distilled both the optimism of the time and the resilience of its people. The video entered the narrative bloodstream, provoking remarks about how \u201cwe used to be a real country\u201d and with it, the demand that we deserve something better than this because we once had something better than this. Shortly afterwards the Texas Rangers began to streak toward the World Series after a rough start. The team gave the credit for their comeback to Creed, which they began to play constantly in the locker room for motivation. Home games in Dallas blared \u201cHigher\u201d and \u201cMy Sacrifice\u201d prompting the fans to sing along in a massive chorus. The Rangers would go on to win the World Series, with a reunited Creed attending the game with Jerseys and a newly announced tour across the United States. The winner of this season of The Voice was a burly white guy belting out Creed\u2019s \u201cHigher\u201d during his finale. In a dark time of \u201cIts So Over\u201d lies the burning embers of a \u201cWe Are So Back\u201d. \u201cEvery act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being.\u201d \u2015 Albert Camus, The Rebel Click the image above to download a PDF of the article. But the regime understands the power of contrast, too. The solution to this problem has been to tear down or change the past. Beloved franchises that influence culture are butchered ignobly by the likes of Kathleen Kennedy. Films and shows of historical fiction are made to impose contemporary norms of sex, diversity, and sarcastic cynicism upon our past. Suddenly there have always been black Scandinavians, African Roman legionnaires in Britain, and the great men of history have their conquests and achievements \u201creimagined\u201d to give someone else the credit. Wikipedia is edited, and classical literature and its heroes are \u201creimagined\u201d and judged through a contemporary lens. Visual media is obviously the most powerful avenue with which to do this. A series like Stranger Things seeks to recreate the most familiar possible representation of the 1980s, only to subtly slip in the values the regime wishes to promote as if this state of affairs has always been the norm. Yellowstone receives critical acclaim only for tough cowboys and patriarchal dynasties to spend spare moments reinforcing that a good feller ought to be a feminist. Like an angler fish with a pretty lure and a poisonous bite, designed to entertain you just enough to where the subversion can slip through. This adds a certain sense of urgency to stopping the rot. It is why we must promote and share the best parts of our past, even if it\u2019s something like a halftime show played by Creed. Those of us who remember the time before the world moved on must pass down what was normal and what was good to the generations born inside the throes of hell world who don\u2019t know any better. It is our duty to shout from the rooftops that this isn\u2019t the best we can do, and it\u2019s not the best we\u2019ve ever done. Even if the past must stay in the past, it provides a blueprint for the right kind of future. This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Inscription Issue\u201d.

The potential of Ethiopia as a bitcoin mining hub resides in the promise of a mutually beneficial relationship between the nation and the industry. In this article, we delve into the transformative power of bitcoin mining to uplift Ethiopian society, unveiling five compelling avenues for prosperity in this East African gem. Bitcoin mining monetizes Ethiopia\u2019s surplus electricity Bitcoin mining allows Ethiopia to transform excess electricity into a valuable commodity, fostering economic growth while maximizing the utilization of its abundant hydropower reserves. Ethiopia's allure for bitcoin miners is undeniably anchored in its abundant hydropower resources. Nestled within the country\u2019s mountainous terrain lies the source of the Blue Nile, accounting for a staggering 85% of the Nile's water. This abundant water wealth translates into the immense potential for hydropower generation, making Ethiopia a prime destination for electricity-intensive industries like bitcoin mining. Kal Kassa, Bitcoin Educator at BitcoinBirr and Alen Makhmetov, CoFounder of Hashlabs Mining at \u201cExporting energy through the internet\u201d a Hashlabs Mining event in Addis Ababa With the potential to harness an estimated 60 GW of hydropower, geothermal, wind, and solar, Ethiopia stands as a powerhouse that could theoretically become capable of generating more than three times the electricity consumed by the entire bitcoin mining network. Presently, the nation has tapped into a fraction of this potential, having an electricity generation capacity of 5.3 GW. Assuming a capacity factor of 40%, Ethiopia's current electricity generation capacity translates to a potential of 18.6 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year under normal rainfall conditions. Comparatively, in 2022, the country's electricity consumption amounted to only 14.7 TWh, leaving approximately 20% of the electricity generation potential unutilized. This number will be even higher during particularly wet years. As if Ethiopia's electricity surplus wasn't already substantial, the nation is on the brink of nearly doubling its generation capacity with the commissioning of The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. This awe-inspiring project will claim the title of Africa's largest hydropower plant, boasting an impressive nameplate capacity of 6.5 GW. With an anticipated capacity factor of 29%, sustained by the continuous influx of water to the dam, the power plant is projected to yield approximately 16.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually. This output is equal to 10% of the consumption of the Bitcoin mining network, underscoring Ethiopia's potential to become a dominant force in both energy production and bitcoin mining. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam The forthcoming Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam's anticipated 16.5 TWh of electricity production will propel Ethiopia's total potential generation to a staggering 35.1 TWh annually under typical rainfall conditions. With current consumption at 14.7 TWh, the surplus electricity generation will amount to an impressive 20.4 TWh, corresponding to a percentage electricity surplus of 58%. Ethiopia is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and is set to see a surge in electricity demand, necessitating the expansion of its hydropower infrastructure. However, the non-modular nature of hydropower plants often leads to overbuilt capacity, resulting in surplus generation until demand catches up. The flexibility inherent in bitcoin mining makes it the perfect match for Ethiopia's surplus electricity, offering a means to monetize until residential, commercial, and industrial consumption catches up. Once demand increases, miners can adapt by relocating or contributing to the financing of new power plants. Without Bitcoin mining, Ethiopia faces the prospect of significant electricity wastage until demand aligns. By seizing the opportunity to leverage its abundant energy resources, Ethiopia positions itself for sustained economic growth, with initiatives like Bitcoin mining serving as a catalyst for optimizing resource utilization and driving prosperity. Bitcoin mining increases Ethiopia\u2019s exports and access to foreign currency Ethiopia grapples with a daunting challenge: a staggering trade deficit. With more dollars flowing out than in, the nation faces mounting difficulties in importing vital goods and services. Compounded by a struggling currency, ironically named the Birr, Ethiopia's citizens are vulnerable to soaring inflation rates. In 2022, Ethiopia imported $23 billion worth of products and services while exporting just $11 billion, leaving a cavernous trade deficit of $12 billion. This deficit is straining the nation's ability to meet debt obligations, showcased by the ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a potential bailout. Luckily, Ethiopia's abundant electricity surplus presents a promising opportunity for foreign currency generation through exports. However, traditional avenues like selling electricity to neighboring countries have been limited due to low demand and weak economies in the region, yielding modest returns of around $70 million annually. Enter Bitcoin mining, a revolutionary solution that transcends geographical constraints by allowing electricity to be converted directly into digital currency. With minimal investment in transmission infrastructure, Ethiopia can tap into the global Bitcoin network as a lucrative consumer of its surplus energy. Jaran Mellerud, Alen Makhmetov, and Marek Šafárik, Cofounders of Hashlabs Mining By embracing Bitcoin mining, Ethiopia diversifies its export income and reduces reliance on neighboring countries for electricity sales. With the ability to export electricity through the Internet, the nation gains a stronger negotiating position and can demand higher prices for its exported power. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Yodahe A. Zemichael of the Information Network Security Administration (INSA) highlighted the government's motivation of legalizing the bitcoin mining industry, citing that companies pay in foreign currency for the electricity they consume in data center operations. Considering the official bitcoin mining tariff of $0.0314/kWh, Ethiopia stands to generate a substantial export income of $640 million if it sells all its excess electricity to Bitcoin miners. Furthermore, by self-mining with the most efficient machines available, the country could potentially yield an export income of $3.9 billion, making Bitcoin mining a transformative force in Ethiopia's economy and potentially its largest export industry. This tantalizing prospect underscores the transformative potential of Bitcoin mining for Ethiopia's economic landscape. Indeed, it's prudent to adjust our expectations to account for real-world factors such as the Bitcoin halving and Ethiopia's likely utilization of a portion of its electricity surplus for other purposes. A more realistic estimate of Ethiopia's export income from Bitcoin mining would likely fall somewhere between $640 million and $3.9 billion, settling in the middle at around $2.3 billion.This figure still positions Bitcoin mining as the largest export industry in Ethiopia, representing a significant economic opportunity for the nation. A $2.3 billion boost in export income would indeed wield transformative power for the Ethiopian economy, providing a vital injection of foreign currency to strengthen the national currency and facilitate easier access to essential imports. Moreover, reducing dependency on foreign lenders would enhance Ethiopia's sovereignty and bolster its economic resilience. At this pivotal moment, Ethiopia faces the imperative of addressing its trade imbalance and charting a course for economic prosperity. Embracing bitcoin mining as a means to export surplus electricity through the internet offers a groundbreaking opportunity to unlock Ethiopia's economic potential. Indeed, it could represent the greatest economic opportunity of this generation for the country. Bitcoin miners can build out electrical infrastructure in Ethiopia The challenge of electrification in Ethiopia is stark: only 54% of the population currently has access to electricity, with rural areas significantly lagging behind urban centers. While cities boast a 94% electrification rate, rural areas struggle at just 43%. The Ethiopian Government has set an ambitious goal of achieving near-universal electrification by 2030, but this endeavor faces significant hurdles. The electrification challenge in Ethiopia, particularly in rural areas, underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions. While the country boasts significant electricity generation capacity, the main hurdle lies in transmitting and distributing this energy to remote communities. Bitcoin miners offer a potential solution by financing and constructing substations in rural areas with surplus electricity, such as those near The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. These substations could serve not only miners but also nearby residents, potentially providing electricity to entire towns. A substation in Africa This approach, akin to efforts by Gridless in Kenya, could complement Ethiopia's goal of near-universal electrification by 2030. Unlike in Kenya, where Gridless focuses on building power plants with bitcoin mining as an anchor customer, Ethiopia already has sufficient power plants. Thus, Ethiopian miners could focus on building out substations to improve the population\u2019s access to electricity. Moreover, the increased revenue from selling electricity to miners could enable Ethiopia to invest in new electrical infrastructure, including substations, transmission lines, and distribution networks. As a result, bitcoin miners could indirectly finance the expansion of electrical infrastructure in Ethiopia, contributing to electrification for Ethiopians and fostering socio-economic development nationwide. Bitcoin mining brings tech jobs to Ethiopia Ethiopia, boasting the second-largest population in Africa with 122 million inhabitants, predominantly comprises a youthful demographic. Regrettably, the nation faces a significant challenge of high unemployment rates among its youth. Introducing the bitcoin mining industry could potentially provide avenues for accessing tech jobs, not limited to mining facilities but also encompassing the broader bitcoin economy poised to develop alongside the foundational growth of the bitcoin mining industry. Bitcoin mining will bring a significant amount of jobs to Ethiopians across many talents and skills. On this, Advisor at Hashlabs Mining Ethiopia, Kal Kassa says: \u201c500 jobs per bitcoin miner is a high goal to meet and I doubt this rumor we\u2019ve been hearing is an honest reflection of the government\u2019s intent to regulate and add thresholds to investment. That being said, facilities with investment over $100 million are very likely to require more than 500 personnel, contractors, vendors, and local suppliers. In fact, we see more than double that in interest from technicians and electrical engineers. Training and certifying skilled talent will be a pillar of our objectives in Ethiopia and I have no doubt we will inspire a generation forward.\u201d Additionally, Hashlabs Mining has sponsored the onboarding of hundreds of wallets at ALX Ethiopia, DevFest\u201924, and the Information Network Security Administration (INSA) in keeping with this vision. Kal Kassa with Elias Abebe, COO of Hello Solar Technology PLC Kassa continues, \u201cFor programmers and devs building, I urge them to build a profile and open a free lightning wallet with sost.tech and similar initiatives to get paid in bitcoin. BTrust Builders may also be a solid destination for experienced computer engineers and enthusiasts. Hashlabs Mining Ethiopia, and various additional sponsors, will be supporting these educational and vocational efforts via the funded Hashlabs Education Fund and BitcoinBirr.\u201d BitcoinBirr, a community of educators and innovators, boasts a strong vision for providing bitcoin learning materials across several languages and regions. Telegram is the most popular platform for communication among its mods and members. Most recently Kal Kassa gave a presentation titled \u201cMining Bitcoin of the Nile River\u201d at Bitcoin Oasis in Dubai. In the next few weeks, and with sponsors from across the world, BitcoinBirr would like to complete the bitcoin training of all 2,000 staff at INSA, in addition to other institutions and organizations that have requested bitcoin education. Beyond hackathons and presentations, Hashlabs Mining is committed to the training of talent in tech. Private sector leaders like Mehrteab Leul and Associates (MLA), Yingke Consultants, Grant Thornton Advisory, MMCY Tech, Boseti Energy Exploration, Meedo Records, HabeshaView, Flawless Events, Education Matters Addis, Tryst Cafe, Ethiopian Airlines and Sheraton Addis are highly appreciated and we honor your friendship during our work in Ethiopia. Ethiopia can leverage mining to build a bitcoin treasury The Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH), the country's sovereign wealth fund, has been rumored to partner with a Chinese bitcoin and data mining group. As per a LinkedIn post shared by EIH\u2019s official account, we understand the project will consist of a multi-million dollar investment. Jaran Mellerud, Cofounder of Hashlabs Mining at an event in Addis Ababa Given the natural series of events that occur with bitcoin miners, the accumulation of bitcoin may be a way for Ethiopia\u2019s treasury to maintain a balance of BTC on behalf of its country. As methods for collateral and proof of reserves develop within the bitcoin \u201cspace\u201d, these reserves may be used to prove creditworthiness. The events surrounding Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may also be instructive to Ethiopians. There is also a sentiment from some Bitcoiners that governments should not be involved in bitcoin mining. And that bitcoin is an experiment by cryptopunks and libertarians to create tools for the free market. Given Ethiopia's recent communist history from 1974 to 1991, Ethiopia\u2019s citizens and leaders may need a refresher course on the Austrian School of Economics. Conclusion We are witnessing significant development in real time. It\u2019s difficult to point towards a singular event or catalyst. But we are at the center of a very serious and interesting moment in our history. The moment we are experiencing allows value to be generated from an open and free community of bitcoin miners. And this novel technology allows humanity to preserve value across time and space. As we dive into the future, it may also be important to note the need for humility. It should be remembered that over the past few years, Ethiopians and East Africa have witnessed a haunting amount of death and destruction, often self-inflicted and many times manipulated on the world stage. We can\u2019t bring back our fallen friends. Like our dear brother Tekeste Sebhat Nega, an early bitcoiner and a visionary. He lost his life in the last few weeks of 2020. An energetic and smart young man died in a senseless civil war. And there are many more stories like him. The entire country is going through a syndrome of sorts, so let\u2019s remain humble as we carry the burden. Let\u2019s move with purpose, passion, and dignity toward a future that values math and physics more than fiat and violence. That is our hope for ourselves and that\u2019s the energy with which we will operate in Ethiopia. This is a guest post by Jaran Mellerud & Kal Kassa.

The proposal aims to provide ASRS and PSPRS with the information needed to make informed decisions about integrating Bitcoin ETFs into their investment strategies, potentially diversifying their portfolios and exploring new avenues for growth.","article_summary":"The bill has passed the Senate and is now being reviewed by the House.","creation_date":"Wed, 06 Mar 2024 15:29:53 GMT","associated_tags":["News","Spot Bitcoin Etf","Business","Bitcoin","arizona"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/arizona-state-senate-considering-adding-bitcoin-etfs-to-retirement-portfolios","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin Enters the Conversation within the German Parliament","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Daniel van Heel"},"article_detailed_content":"With the kickoff event 'Bitcoin im Bundestag,' Bitcoin has entered the political discourse in Germany. Roman Reher of Blocktrainer, the largest German-speaking Bitcoin YouTube channel, and Kristian Kläger, CEO and founder of terahash.energy GmbH, delivered two formidable introductory presentations in the German Parliament. Since German politicians still mainly associate Bitcoin with criminal activities, money laundering, and climate damage, the objective was to nurture a better understanding of the unique opportunities Bitcoin has to offer. Privacy was paramount to kickstarting the event. Given that Bitcoin remains a complicated subject in German politics, ensuring full privacy for attending MPs and their staff was crucial to spare them potential reprimands from their party leaders. The event was well-attended, also by visitors from outside. Since MPs preferred to take a backseat on the main floor, ordinary visitors were invited to fill the front seats. Overall, the event was a big success, and more Bitcoin events in the Bundestag are in the pipeline. While cameras were not permitted during the main event, a few exclusive moments later allowed for capturing select opinions on camera. Joana Cotar is the founder of the initiative 'Bitcoin im Bundestag.' As a party-independent MP, she has the privilege of putting Bitcoin on the agenda, for example, during debates about the introduction of the digital Euro. As a party member, this would not have been possible. Still, her former affiliation with the right-wing AfD poses challenges too. In German politics, guilt by association is a strong mechanism, and no party wants to collaborate with the AfD. It creates a political vacuum and has led to discussions within the Berlin Bitcoin community. According to her it is good to remind oneself that Bitcoin is apolitical, uncensorable, and free money, and even your worst enemy can use it. Also in the German parliament, Bitcoin is a bottom up movement, and according to Joana Cotar, the staff of the MPs play a crucial role in getting the topic on the agenda. They work long hours with the MPs, and are also often consciously encouraged by Members of the German Parliament to explore new topics. In the following interview, Joana Cotar provides unprecedented insights into the workings of German politics. She discusses the free access banking lobbyists have to the German parliament, their strong influence on MPs, and articulates concrete requests such as making Bitcoin legal tender, allowing for self-custody, promoting sustainable Bitcoin mining, and urging opposition to the introduction of the digital Euro.

This milestone comes as Bitcoin continues its remarkable ascent after spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, leading to a consistent large influx of capital into BTC.

Bitcoin's previous all time high of $69,010 happened almost three years ago on November 10, 2021, 846 days ago. For the month of February, Bitcoin had the biggest green monthly candle in its history, rising almost $20,000 that month alone. To put into context how bullish that month was price wise, the bear market bottom for bitcoin was ~$16,000, meaning bitcoin pumped almost $4,000 more than that alone in February. JUST IN: #Bitcoin had its biggest monthly green candle EVER in February 🤯🚀 pic.twitter.com/BsaCIXGTJx \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 1, 2024 Bitcoin's meteoric rise has been fueled by a variety of factors, including increasing institutional adoption, growing interest from retail investors, and broader acceptance by traditional financial institutions. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical tensions and inflationary concerns have propelled demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. US spot Bitcoin ETFs had their second biggest day in terms of trading volume yesterday, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. BlackRock's ETF was responsible for $2.4 billion of the $5.5 billion traded yesterday. Last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs bought over 30,029 BTC, while miners only mined 6,160 new BTC. This massive demand and very limited supply of bitcoin being created every day has been the main driver causing bitcoin's price to increase dramatically. Here's the weekly summary (Feb. 24 - March 1, h/t @HODL15Capital).

I know this piece will come across as annoying to some, especially because I have only been bullish on bitcoin with some gusto for the last couple of months (though I first pointed it out to my readers in December 2022), but as a newfound member of the church of bitcoin community, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t try out my voice a bit. I apologize in advance for opining on things that many members of planet bitcoin have talked about and debated ad nauseam for the last decade. But, one way or another, I have to get myself up to speed, and I do that best cathartically through writing. As a result, you, the reader, are left here to suffer. So, you know, don\u2019t forget to renew your paid subscriptions to Fringe Finance. Enough with the prelude \u2014 we all know it has been a breathtaking week for bitcoin, which is up well over 20% in just the span of days. \"Oh my fuck.\" - Bubbles, Trailer Park Boys The moves have done well to spin up even more interest in the cryptocurrency than there was over the last month with the launch of the ETFs. Hell, even Morgan Stanley came out this week and said they were thinking of throwing their hat into the ring and launching a bitcoin fund of their own. I\u2019ve gotten a number of phone calls and texts about bitcoin, and I\u2019m not even a prominent member of the community, nor am I a well-known bull. And so I can\u2019t even imagine the outreach that maximalists and longtime advocates have seen this week. Undoubtedly, it is exciting, and I can\u2019t even imagine how long people have been waiting to savor this moment, after years of abuse from family members and uninformed assholes like myself, as well as general doubt about the asset class. But, if there is one small lesson I have learned from decades in the capital markets that I think translates across asset classes, it is to celebrate modestly and prepare for the worst. That may seem like the furthest thing from people's minds this week, but for me, it has always been the best way to savor success. Many people who listened to the podcast that I did a couple of weeks ago with Peter McCormack know that it was arrogance and hubris that turned me off from bitcoin to begin with. Perhaps that is my fault for not having an open enough mind and not doing enough of my own work \u2013 it\u2019s a mistake that saw me miss out on large gains. But today I\u2019m speaking as one of the people who can visualize bitcoin as a long-term success and are genuinely excited about onboarding the rest of the world. My Twitter feed over the last week has been replete with people triumphantly celebrating, bragging, and taking shots at those who doubted that the price would ever go back up again. Here\u2019s one example from my brother James Lavish, who I know well enough to know he won\u2019t mind me using him as an example because he knows I respect the shit out of him. Behold Exhibit A: James talking shit to Vanguard. Does James have a point? Yes, he does. Could be wind up being right 50 years from now also? Yes, he could. But is it karmically sound to taunt the $7.7 trillion bear? To me, not really. I\u2019d rather just savor the satisfaction of the temporary dub quietly. Everybody is well within their rights to celebrate this short-term action anyway they would like, but what I\u2019m suggesting today is that karmically and psychologically, the less you force the issue and the more humility you show, the more evenly and consistently bitcoin will thread itself through the rest of the world. Think of this: celebrating making an exorbitant amount of money or rage-tweeting about your success is going to do two things: (1)it\u2019s going to turn off people like myself who think that behavior is generally synonymous with fraud and (2) it\u2019s going to excite investors with lower-than-average sophistication who will look for quick riches and won\u2019t be the steady hands bitcoin needs to become a perpetual success. Rather, what I\u2019m suggesting is to allow the news media to do what they do (generally be useless and chase stories long after they\u2019ve happened) and allow people to come to the realization about bitcoin the same way that I did: on my own, once I felt as though I wasn\u2019t being suffocated with the idea by outside sources anymore. My interest in looking at bitcoin this go-round in early 2024 was completely organic: the news coverage of it had died down, and I had blocked or unfollowed enough people who were hyping it that I could have some clarity and some peace of mind about it when I sat down to consider how it worked, seriously, for the first time ever. It was that calm, relaxed, blank slate that allowed me to grasp the relatively complex concepts of how it worked and believe in it the way that I do now. I think given the astronomical week that we just had, we\u2019d be better off to \u201cact like we\u2019ve been here before\u201d and to remember that sometimes the more you push an idea, the more people are prone to resistance than barking like hyenas and taunting people. If bitcoin had a $50 trillion market cap, that\u2019d be a different story. But we\u2019re still in the early stages of this courtship with the rest of the world and, like any good relationship or friendship in your life, there has to be a genuine organic interest in \u201cshowing up\u201d to the idea of it happening. All of those who have been smothered by a partner or a friend in the past know that all it does is create distortions and unhealthy dynamics. Such delicate things cannot be forced, but rather, accepted willfully like a slow, purposeful deep breath outside on a winter day. This is not to say that I don\u2019t believe this week is the beginning of much larger adoption that would likely drive the price of bitcoin higher. As I said on the \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did\u201d podcast, I believe that there is at least one, if not several, nation-states looking at putting bitcoin on their sovereign balance sheets, and that this will kick off a period of game theory for the digital asset revolution the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen yet. Just days after I said that, yesterday Edward Snowden came out and postulated the same. Try to keep up with me, Eddie. But in all seriousness, we know what will happen if the price continues to rise. The hype will continue to flywheel further, as will interest and adoption. People will have the same realization that it took me a decade to figure out: this thing simply isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. But if you ask me, especially given the fact that we all know how quickly price moves can whipsaw back to the downside in the short term, I think the community would be well served to focus less on spiking the football here and more on how we will be able to clearly explain and convey the transformation that is unfolding before our eyes in a calm, measured, and comprehensive way. After all, whose questions do you want to deal with on the next 20% overnight whipsaw lower: unsophisticated maniacs or measured investors who already know and expect the volatility that is a certainty. And the more time we spend setting reasonable expectations that bitcoin can easily exceed, instead of overpromising and underdelivering, the less time we have to brag about being right. The journey is the reward. Or, as the bible says: \u201cWhen pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.\u201d \u2014 Proverbs 11:2 But I think if Jesus were around today, he would simply tell us to \u201clet bitcoin cook\u201d.

","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Maria Carola"},"article_detailed_content":"Steering through a sea of change in the crypto market, the investment game is experiencing a seismic shift. Spot Bitcoin ETFs already exist, signaling Bitcoin's leap into mainstream finance and knitting it closer to conventional investment fabrics. We'll look at the tip of the iceberg trying to imagine its true depth as well as the current correlation between Bitcoin, stocks, and Gold. We\u2019ll attempt to figure out if the traditional market is really leading Bitcoin out of its decentralized place, or if there's still an avenue for hope that it can maintain its unique path. According to the Kaiko data, Bitcoin's risk-adjusted returns were superior to traditional assets. Nvidia led with the highest returns on a risk-adjusted basis, while Bitcoin impressively trailed just behind, outpacing major traditional assets like the S&P 500, Gold, with its value surging over 160% in risk-adjusted terms. Source: Kaiko Research Meanwhile, according to the IMF Crypto Cycle and US Monetary Policy study, 80% of variation in crypto prices and its increasing correlation with equity markets coincided with the entry of institutional investors into crypto markets since 2020. In particular, trading volumes by institutions on crypto exchanges grew by more than 1,700% (from roughly $25 billion to more than $450 billion) during the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. According to the study, the US monetary policy affects the crypto cycle, just like global equity cycles, but surprisingly, only the US Fed's monetary policy matters, not the other major central banks \u2013 probably because crypto markets are highly USD-dependent. Furthermore, the 2023 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Outlook Survey indicates that 64% of investors are set to up their stakes in the crypto sphere within three years, allocating up to 5% of AUM to crypto. It said a number of institutions made investments for the first time over the past year, while others increased their existing investments. While the study highlights a surge in crypto commitment from 41% of asset managers, only 27% of asset owners seem to be ramping up their stakes. Although Bitcoin was born from the idea of spreading power equally, recent studies indicate that it's slowly becoming dominated by a select few big players. Changing Correlation Dynamics Interestingly, Bitcoin moves in sync with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, with an impressive correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation between Bitcoin and Gold has sharply decreased recently, contrasting with claims that investors see crypto as a safe haven or hedge against inflation, a role traditionally played by Gold. Source: TheBlock Notably, Bitcoin's correlation with Gold was positive at 0.83 on November 7, 2023, but decreased to -0.1 on January 10, 2024, before rebounding to a marginally higher positive level 0.14 on February 9, 2024. In the meantime, Bitcoin's relationship with the S&P 500 saw a negative correlation of -0.76 on November 11, 2023, and then hit a positive correlation of 0.57 in January 2024. Ths shift from negative to positive correlation points to Bitcoin's changing perception among investors. The Nasdaq Composite, known for its technology and growth stocks, also displayed a variable correlation with Bitcoin. The negative correlation, of -0.69 on October 30, 2023, shifted to positive 0.44 in January. It seems traders are linking Bitcoin's rhythm to the tech sector's pulse, hinting at a new kinship in investment strategies. When the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional equity markets like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq increases, while its correlation with Gold decreases, it suggests that Bitcoin is behaving more like a risk-on asset rather than a safe haven. When investors are feeling venturous, they often swing toward stocks and digital coins for the chance at juicier profits. If institutional and retail investors are increasingly involved in both equity and cryptocurrency markets, their simultaneous buy and sell decisions could cause the price movements of these assets to align. Spot Bitcoin ETFs getting the green light seem to be ramping up its charm for big-time investors, with a solid chunk already planning to boost their Bitcoin game. Bitcoin's move into ETFs might make it act more like stocks since those funds are big players in the stock world. Amidst these developments, the essence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, free from the confines of traditional financial systems, could be undermined. Moreover, these shifts could expose Bitcoin to the very systemic risks from which it was designed to escape. Closing Thoughts As we look at how spot Bitcoin ETFs might shake up Bitcoin's role in the market and its current tie to stocks, we need to keep a sharp eye on balancing our excitement for more big players jumping in and the possible growth with staying true to Bitcoin's core principle of not being centrally controlled. Bitcoin's move toward a more centralized investment scene could stir the market, offering bright opportunities, but also tough challenges ahead. This is a guest post by Maria Carola.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. The United States federal government has once again added to its substantial Bitcoin hoard, transferring $922 million worth from wallets associated with Bitfinex hackers in a seizure. Over the course of a series of various seizures and other asset forfeitures, the United States federal government has accumulated and holds enough Bitcoin to unquestionably count as one of the largest whales. In the earliest days of the Bitcoin scene, the overwhelming crypto-anarchist spirit among the community led to a series of various extralegal business ventures, most famously the Silk Road. This overtly illegalist era of the industry is more or less completely over, but the success of these early ventures accumulated massive amounts of Bitcoin: which has in time been accumulated by the US government. The Silk Road alone has been at the center of several massive seizures from law enforcement agencies, with the site\u2019s actual coffers far from the only source. On multiple occasions over the last few years, various hackers who robbed the Silk Road have in turn seen their assets seized and added to the federal government\u2019s massive stockpile. Even though hundreds of millions of bitcoins from this source have already been sold at government auctions or through other means, there are still billions left to go. For their part, law enforcement agencies seem to be in no hurry to wash their hands of these assets. Source On February 29, the stockpile grew once again when the government moved more than 15k bitcoins from the wallets of two Bitfinex hackers. The hackers, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather \u201cRazzlekhan\u201d Morgan, recently testified about their 2016 hack of Bitfinex, which ranks as one of the most profitable heists of all time with nearly 120k bitcoins stolen. Bitfinex, one of the oldest still-operating exchanges in the entire crypto ecosystem, is still a prominent service, but their operations still bear lingering scars from a theft of this magnitude. For one thing, US citizens are completely forbidden from accessing the platform, along with citizens from several other countries. Perhaps it is for this reason that the Justice Department has refused to state whether or not the government intends to reimburse Bitfinex\u2019s 2016 customers, who actually had their money stolen. Regardless of what the government\u2019s plans are with this money, a seizure like this has once again highlighted the sheer size of the federal government\u2019s Bitcoin reserve. Thankfully, the government\u2019s dealings with these assets are all a matter of public record, and Bitcoin transactions themselves are all completely transparent on the blockchain. For this reason, analysts are confident in the claim that the United States holds just shy of 200k bitcoins, worth approximately $12.1 billion. This makes them unmistakably one of the largest whales out there, with only Binance and Satoshi holding greater amounts. In fact, the government currently holds nearly 1% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Regardless of claims that prosecutors have no interest in maximizing profits when disposing of these assets, it\u2019s undeniable that the government holds substantial leverage over the whole space. These seizures are particularly interesting due to some recent comments made by exiled whistleblower Edward Snowden. Specifically, considering the rising global acceptance of Bitcoin in regulation and traditional finance, Snowden predicted that \u201cA national government will be revealed this year to have been buying Bitcoin\u2014the modern replacement for monetary gold\u2014without having disclosed that fact publicly\u201d. If Bitcoin is the digital gold, after all, it would only make sense that powerful nations would want to build up reserves. The strategy has famously worked for the Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, who greeted the new bull market with a declaration that his country\u2019s Bitcoin investment has gone up by 40% since the initial purchases. Not, of course, that he plans to sell. In any event, Snowden\u2019s comments seem especially relevant in that the United States hasn\u2019t actually purchased any of the Bitcoin it currently holds. Even though the government has a theoretical responsibility to dispose of these assets, the pace as of yet has been glacial, and in the meantime, it would be extremely straightforward for Congress to halt these sales. All it would take is a desire for the policy to change, and a genuine Bitcoin reserve could spring up overnight. This is the crux of Snowden\u2019s specific prediction that governments will acquire Bitcoin secretly and that the government has ample plausible deniability. We don\u2019t have a reserve; we just happen to be reserving these assets for a later sale. There is nothing suspicious about that! If a government did actually want to acquire massive quantities of Bitcoin in secret, it would run into a great number of transparency problems caused by the trustless nature of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. The anonymous \u201cMr. 100\u201d has made headlines throughout the month of February, acquiring a mind boggling 100 BTC per day and reaching the status of the 15th largest whale. As chain analysts have tried to determine the buyer\u2019s identity, speculation has already begun that a national government is the culprit. Based on the timing of the purchases and several other factors, the buyer is likely in Asia, specifically the Middle East. Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia\u2014all these are strong candidates to be the coins\u2019 rightful owners. In other words, if a government wishes to build up a Bitcoin reserve, it might be easier to seize the assets outright rather than buy them at fair value. After all, if the transactions will be recorded on the blockchain either way, why not save their money? The UK seems well-positioned to build up a stockpile in this way like the Americans, having seized $1.77 billion in January. Not only were these bitcoins seized from a foreign national currently on the run, with no recourse to recoup these funds, but the British government has subsequently passed legislation deepening its power to seize or freeze cryptocurrency assets. It wouldn\u2019t take much to start building up a notable hoard in its own right. By this point, the days when Bitcoin\u2019s core community held a defiant attitude towards law enforcement are a distant memory. Although people can commit crimes centered around Bitcoin just like they can with any other currency, the fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is only becoming more legitimate for the world\u2019s governments. US regulators approved a Bitcoin ETF, and other countries are falling like dominoes to endorse it themselves. Eventually, it\u2019ll be a necessity for powerful governments to stay on par with their competitors and maintain their own reserves of Bitcoin. The US, after all, controls nearly 1% of a massive industry with substantial leverage over it. Are they going to be the only country with this leverage? It may be difficult for any nation to build up these stockpiles in secret, but even so, the race has already begun. No matter who wins it, it\u2019s Bitcoin that will be on top in the end.","article_summary":"Massive Bitcoin seizures from Bitfinex hackers add to US government stockpile.

In sum, the EIA will voluntarily terminate the illegal EIA-862 collection action they initiated, and they will commit to destroying all the information that they have received and may still receive under the EIA-862. Furthermore, they will also cancel and withdraw the February 9th, 2024 notice for collection, replacing it with a new Notice. This new notice will run for a full 60 days from the date it is released in the Federal Register, and the EIA also has consented to ensure that any comments which have been received on the Feb. 9th notice will be incorporated and considered in the new notice.

Those arguments are as weak as you might expect, but they will be out there and will need to be addressed and overcome.

The existing paradigm mirrors the primal imperative of reaping benefits in exchange for labor\u2013working to survive, but the pay-per-time system in the labor market is creating the incentive to get something for nothing. In the whole \u201cfiat stack,\u201d everyone optimizes their efforts to achieve this on different levels, as I explain below. How can I get money for nothing? As we explore the effects of instant settlement across diverse industries, a fundamental divide between workers and clockwatchers emerges, as I have argued throughout this series. Fiat payments work without instant settlement; instead, a virtual credit arrives immediately with the actual settlement usually coming much later. The Lightning Network enables instant settlement. That is a key advantage, and it\u2019s why Bitcoin is the only financial network that has the potential to achieve the vision that I am describing in this series. The fiat monetary system is training us to play the game of rent-seeking without realizing it, and it is no wonder that the best players become the richest. From our first jobs, we learn how to extract maximum payment for minimum effort, and the incentives reward creative ways of doing just that. The first trick everyone learns is how to \u201cmilk the clock\u201d by doing as little as possible without getting fired. A slightly more advanced technique is learning how to take credit for others\u2019 work. Skilled players seek promotions in order to gain access to others\u2019 labor for their own benefit. This is the fiat game. As if that weren\u2019t bad enough, the rent-seeking game also corrodes skills. Just as my results in the gym are correlated with the effort I invest into my workout, employees\u2019 mastery comes from effort. But time-based compensation rewards passing time rather than performance, allowing skills to atrophy. In technologically primitive societies, skill development was imperative for survival. The problem was friction: assessing the value for each miniscule action and compensating each one individually. So the obvious way to reduce friction was to collapse all the tasks into a single variable \u2014 time. But after decades of time-based compensation and diminishing initiative, we are becoming lethargic, weak, skill-deficient, and reliant on free money. The result is a culture of dependency, where the quest for easy money overshadows the pursuit of self-improvement. How many steps are we from enslaving our own children to avoid working? Perhaps the key to overcoming this fate is deciding not to chase the fucking money, but to pursue other goals instead and just using the money to achieve them. Make a list of what you want in life and start working towards it. Instead of working for wages, saving money, and buying a house, you can build your own house. Yes, it will take years, but that is the point. Do the work! If you object that you can\u2019t build a house, you\u2019re probably right. You can\u2019t do anything until you can. It\u2019s simply a matter of placing one brick on top of another, a roof on top of the walls, and so on. Work transforms us, makes us better, faster, stronger, and more skillful versions of our former selves. Bitcoin preserves the value of your energy, allowing you to achieve your goals faster than is possible with fiat. When you are working for others\u2019 goals, you should be compensated instantly, which is almost like double compensation. You get skills and money. In the fiat system, when you get free money (money for time passed), you do not acquire any skills, and the skills you have start to atrophy because you are not using them. The only incentive that pushes people to do something is the fear of getting fired. That is why they seek to find the balance right between minimal work and not getting fired. But there remains an undeniable obstacle: why should I work for my money rather than simply waiting and receiving it without exertion? The status quo is comfortable, but comfort is the enemy. Defeating this enemy requires a collective willingness to break free from the allure of effortless gains and embracing a more natural, purposeful way of working. Those who shun time-based compensation will have the advantage of attracting and retaining the most exceptional individuals as employees. As these forward-thinkers continually evolve\u2013growing faster, stronger, and more skillful over time\u2013their products and services will outshine pay-per-time systems. In the new market landscape I have described throughout this series, employees who are paid for their work rather than their time are no longer tethered to a single company. The quality of products and services is propelled by the collective efforts of the contributors rather than malingering clock milkers supervised and pushed by management. Labor exploitation becomes untenable, and pay-for-work is what retains the best talent. This is true simply because the best want to be paid based on results, and the only fair compensation to both the employee and employer is pay-per-work, which is based on those results. This newfound power may lead individuals to focus on the things they want to see built rather than what the company tells them to build. They gain not only a decentralized income but can also benefit the most from the tasks they complete. If there is an open project to fix ten roads, I will contribute to fixing the one that I use most. It is the most selfish altruistic thing. That benefit is not private; it is shared. The money I receive is private. As long as we chase money rather than projects, it is no surprise we are indifferent towards other people's problems. In this new paradigm, the balance of power shifts decisively to the people, aligning with their preferences and aspirations, not the agenda of a single company. Additionally, the pay-for-work system mirrors the competitive nature of sports\u2013individuals are compensated for their time and effort, but victory is contingent on active participation and skill. In sports, the best players distinguish themselves with their superior skills, the effort they invest, and their adaptability in the face of competition. This natural dynamic, favoring the fastest, strongest, and most adaptable, can now enrich the labor market. Survival and prosperity will hinge not only on individual effort but on the ability to outperform others in the pursuit of a larger share of benefits. Even those merely chasing money prosper by simply mirroring Bitcoin. If I do something selfishly in Bitcoin, the whole network benefits. In the world of sports, fame and wealth often follow the best players, but their initial motivation lies in the desire to be the best. Encouragement in the pay-for-work labor market takes the form of payment, catalyzing continued dedication and progress. The accumulation of these payments, akin to encouragement, propels people to refine their skills, enhance their performance, and, in turn, receive more Bitcoin in acknowledgment of their efforts. The reward in this system is not acclaim or praise; it starts as a necessity for money and progresses to satisfaction derived from the work. Instant settlement becomes the Trojan horse guiding us back to this ethos. In this continuous competition, unlike the win-lose dynamics of warfare, everyone stands to gain. Individuals work for themselves, driven by the desire to achieve their own goals, while the finished product simultaneously serves a common need because a lot of them are collective goods. The swifter, more efficient, and cost-effective completion of tasks that benefit the community will induce a snowball effect where subsequent benefits build on previous ones. In this interconnected web, where everyone coordinates efficiently, there is no theft or exploitation; rather, it is a shared journey toward collective betterment. With pay-for-time, people seek to climb the hierarchy and obtain the privilege of delegating, which lets them shift accountability and find scapegoats. In stark contrast, the pay-for-work built on instant-settlement systems operates like the immutable and uncompromising laws of physics. Every individual bears complete responsibility for their work. This paradigm gauges individuals not by their inclination to assign blame or dwell on problems, but by their responsibility and their commitment to accomplishing the job at hand. The best performance yields the most money, so pay-for-work puts the job first, unlike pay-for-time, where more money results from more time passed, and the job is almost irrelevant. In the pay-for-work system, responsibility becomes a measure of personal and professional integrity, fostering a culture where the focus is on getting the work done efficiently and collaboratively. Roy Sheinfeld, Breez CEO and my boss, has said that we should not tell people what experiences to create in their apps. I agree. The point of the previous chapters was to spark interest in the possibilities so the experts can create those experiences. I am not the right person to say how construction, logistics, book publishing, and other industries should evolve. I am trying to open the window for them to realize the potential they can create and build for all of us. If they do this we all win. They receive Bitcoin, and in turn, we spend Bitcoin more efficiently on things that enrich our lives. This collaborative venture is an invitation to explore, innovate, and contribute to a shared future where everyone stands to gain. Here\u2019s a quick recap with the take-home messages from the previous articles in this series: The first article: The Construction Industry What is work? The conflict between people who are asked to work but benefit from passing time without working. How reputation depends on the work done, not someone\u2019s job title. Second article: The Logistics Industry How delaying payments creates counterparty risk. How intermediaries (banks) compound that risk. How split payments align everyone\u2019s incentives to deliver on a project. Decentralization fostering competition. Third article: The Publishing Industry The dematerialized economy is now on steroids The benefit of any work is determined more by demand for it than supply of it Talking and selling are not the same, so commissions are the best way to compensate influencers Forth article: Real-time Streaming Payments Benefiting from work can be a continuous process with streaming payments. Global benefits deserve global compensation. Auctioning seats to events can transform live entertainment. Fifth article: The Gambling Industry Fiat is gambling. Licenses and credentials disadvantage the poor and reinforce the power of the rich. How to invest wisely. A transitional period is crucial. If a business were to suddenly shift to a performance-based pay model without considering the existing workforce, it could lead to unrest and prompt employees to leave for a pay-per-time company. Those who recognize the need for change should adopt a long-term perspective and implement both payment methods \u2013 pay-per-time and instant settlement \u2013 simultaneously. The objective is to have these methods coexist, attracting top performers and fostering a culture of excellence. Once the company establishes a foundation of high-performing individuals, it can then phase out the pay-per-time structure entirely. I draw inspiration for this approach from my mentor from a distance, Jeff Booth, as these two systems represent distinct paradigms, necessitating a careful and strategic transition rather than an abrupt shift. These are my final messages: Build utility, do not promise future fortunes. Do not wait or ask permission to do work. Do the work that you want to do. Let's Fucking GO!

Bitpac stands for a Bitcoin Based Publicly Auditable Cooperative. Bitpacs are essentially normal bitcoin multisig wallets with the additional introduction of public auditability. Traditionally in a multisig setup, participants of the multisig are not disclosed. In a Bitpac multisig, participants are intentionally made public, which allows for transparent auditability. With this transparency, unique features, tooling, rules, and transaction crafting is possible. The goal of Bitpacs is to emulate the familiar DAO experience on other chains. DAO\u2019s are marketed as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. However, Ethereum and other altcoin based DAOs only inherit the \u201cdecentralization\u201d of their chain, so will not be as decentralized as the same experience built on Bitcoin. DAO\u2019s are also not autonomous, as humans control and shape the decisions they make. The Bitpac definition is a more honest explanation of the tech involved and I think eventually will be a better experience for users. Why should bitcoiners even care about DAO\u2019s? As of Feb 18th 2024, DAO\u2019s on Ethereum hold over $35 billion in treasury funds. There have been millions of DAO proposal makers and voters, and hundreds of millions of dollars have been transacted via DAO governance. (source) There is clear demand for on-chain governance and community management, Bitpacs allow this to come to Bitcoin. How can Bitpacs actually work? While Bitpacs don't directly utilize smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, they achieve similar functionality as DAOs through a combination of multisig wallets and carefully crafted Bitcoin transactions. The structures possible with this encompass most of what a DAO does: Multisig ensures that no one is ever in unilateral control of any Bitpac funds, requiring the quorum threshold to spend anything. Signing thresholds that mandate how many signatures are needed to finalize a transaction (3 of 5 or 6 of 10 for example) can fine tune required voting thresholds in line with the defined Bitpac consensus requirements. Time constraints can be applied to voting rounds, ending the signing process for proposals that haven\u2019t achieved a signing threshold by the end of a voting period. Gating membership of Bitpacs based on certain criteria can be done at the platform level, like unique assets held, bitcoin contributed to the treasury, or known wallet addresses, all of which can be verified on-chain. All of these dynamics that cannot be enforced through Bitcoin script or pre-signed transactions, and must resort to social enforcement, are transparently verifiable on-chain guaranteeing detection of Bitpac rule violations. What do Bitpacs enable on Bitcoin? Bitpacs unlock exciting possibilities for bitcoin users: Community-driven funding: Fundraising for public goods, projects, or charitable causes becomes more efficient and secure with Bitpacs. Contributors can trust that funds are used as intended, thanks to the transparent nature of the multisig. Decentralized governance: Bitpacs empower communities to make collective decisions regarding fund allocation and spending. Voting rights are distributed among key holders, ensuring a transparent and verifiable process. Increased trust and collaboration: By eliminating the opacity often associated with traditional financial systems, Bitpacs build trust and foster collaboration between individuals with shared interests, and doing so fully on-chain. Some specific examples of Bitpac use cases include: Funding open-source development: Developers can create Bitpacs to receive community funding for their projects, with transparent spending records ensuring accountability to their backers. Managing community treasuries: Any organization can leverage Bitpacs for transparent management of their funds, allowing members to track spending, create proposals, and participate in decision-making. Crowdfunding: Bitpacs can be used as a means to crowdfund bitcoin from a group of supporters for a pre-established shared goal, company, investment fund, or project. A major lesson for the industry over the last year has been how much innovation and experimentation can still be done on native Bitcoin without requiring any changes to the network. We have seen massive interest around BitVM, Ordinals, roll-ups, sidechains, layers, metaprotocols, all within bitcoins current consensus. There is clearly a cambrian explosion of developer and user interest coming to Bitcoin which will not slow down any time soon. Tens of thousands of new niche communities will be popping up on Bitcoin in the coming years. This doesn\u2019t include traditional companies that continue to trend towards Bitcoin adoption over time. Bitpacs can agnostically offer community organization, treasury management, and on-chain governance to all of them. The thousands of ideas being \u201cbuilt on Bitcoin\u201d should have one thing in common, eventual settlement on the base layer. Different methods of governance will be experimented with over time, but this is why Bitpacs could be the superior model. Bitpac members have direct voting access to the treasury and transactions occur at the base layer; there is no side-chain, layer, or additional protocol that Bitpac members need to trust. Potentially this cycle, people will start to realize that Bitcoin block space is just as scarce as bitcoin the asset. As we trend further towards a hyperbitcoinized world, with nation states and institutions transacting, I think that Bitpacs representing large community or entity treasuries will be one of the few things that will justify occurring at the Base layer. \u2013 Anybody can create Bitpacs on their own. @Tribe_btc is a centralized project I\u2019m working on aiming to create a full tooling suite for Bitpacs. Tribe will be releasing our Bitpac documentation soon.

While there aren't really any fundamentally new pieces or developments in the Anduro design, they do compose in slightly different ways compared to other existing sidechain systems such as RSK or Liquid/Elements. Anduro is a federated model that makes use of a quorum, referred to as the \u201cCollective\u201d in the released documents. The main distinction between Anduro and other sidechain proposals is the explicit design based around the Collective operating and being capable of spinning up and managing multiple sidechains with different architectures. This is not so dissimilar from the concept of drivechains enabled a wider network of sidechains, rather than a singular one. Anduro is also going to be merge mined, which like RSK (also using a federated peg), does not offer any type of added security for the bitcoin pegged into the sidechain held by the federation. It does however, also like RSK, provide POW security to other assets that might be issued on the sidechain not pegged in from the mainchain and custodied by the federation. Peg And Consensus Model The actual peg between the mainchain and the sidechain is fundamentally the same thing as Liquid, and in detail looks to be roughly identical in terms of structure and implementation. The Collective will be launched with 15 members as Functionaries, the entities actually handling the multisig keys involved with managing the peg, and 50 or more Contributors, which seem to be similar to Liquid partial members that can whitelist and initiate withdrawals from the sidechain(s) even though they are not active participants in processing those withdrawals. Also like Liquid, Anduro will also use a formal organization to handle matters of governance. I.e. handling upgrades to the network, deciding on future changes to the membership set of the federation, and in general any issues that will come up in regards to the operation of the sidechains the Collective is operating. The federation\u2019s security ultimately relies on jurisdictional diversity in order to maintain any type of censorship resistance or safety from fund confiscation even though a federation is composed of honest members. The interesting part of the design here, is unlike RSK, the Collective plays an active role in the consensus process beyond facilitating the operations of the peg mechanism. In Anduro, the Collective actually comes to consensus on the block contents for the sidechain through a Byztanine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm or round robin selection where a single member constructs the blocks for that round. They also periodically sign blocks to function as a checkpointing system to prevent reordering of anything in the historical past. Once signed and checkpointed, miners are incapable of reorging any sidechain blocks without the assistance of the Collective. Both of these factors essentially function as a firewall between Miner Extractable Value opportunities and the miners. MEV is any opportunity available to miners where reordering transactions, such as front running orders on a decentralized exchange, can present an opportunity for that miner to earn extra revenue when they mine their next block. MEV has shown a tendency to increase centralization pressures for block producers in other networks it has become prevalent in. Because of the fact that the Collective is actually deciding the contents of sidechain blocks, and miners are simply committing to them with proof of work, the Collective acts as a shield against those centralizing pressures for block producers (in Bitcoin\u2019s case miners) by taking on the role of actual block construction. Long term Marathon states they intend to work towards trustless peg mechanisms and consensus mechanisms, specifically citing BitVM as an example of how this could be achievable. While this draws into question the ability to maintain the MEV protections the current architecture has in such a transition, it currently prevents MEV from presenting a risk of centralization pressures for miners. It\u2019s also important to note that BitVM ultimately as designed with a prover-verifier model inherently requires defined participants to manage any funds locked in a BitVM peg. While it does radically improve the security model of the peg by allowing provable penalization of dishonest participants by a single member, massive changes to BitVM\u2019s design itself would be necessary to completely remove the need for the equivalent of a federation. Overall the architecture strikes a nice balance of implementing a variant of existing sidechain designs, while in its current iteration intentionally creating a sort of protective layers between the sidechains and miners when it comes to the risks of MEV. The First Two On launch Anduro will have support for two sidechain architectures, one based on Bitcoin, the other on Ethereum. Coordinate: Coordinate is the Bitcoin sidechain variant. It will implement small changes to Bitcoin, including native support for asset issuance similar to Liquid, and is intending to cater towards Ordinals and token use cases such as BRC-20, and the primitive DeFi products and services that have built up around them. Alys: Alys is the Ethereum sidechain variant, essentially just porting the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity to a Bitcoin sidechain. The hope is that it can provide a new learning curve environment for Ethereum application developers to shift their focus towards building services and tools on top of Bitcoin.","article_summary":"Anduro is a federated/merge mined hybrid sidechain design, specifically designed to enable the federation to manage multiple sidechains with differing architectures.","creation_date":"Thu, 29 Feb 2024 19:23:17 GMT","associated_tags":["Anduro","Sidechains","Technical","Opinion"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/anduro-a-network-of-sidechains","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine"},{"article_title":"Wells Fargo and Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Are Now Offering Spot Bitcoin ETFs To Clients  ","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Nik Hoffman"},"article_detailed_content":"Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo & Co.\u2019s brokerage unit have begun offering access to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that directly invest in Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg Law.

Department of Energy case. But, as often happens in litigation, things change quickly. Tuesday the judge entered an order canceling today's hearing based on the parties reaching an \"agreement-in-principle\" on the overall dispute. This agreement must be finalized and filed by Friday, March 1st. Speculation time. What could this mean? One element of the standard for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), and a preliminary injunction, is that the party requesting it has to show that they are \"likely to succeed on the merits.\" This means that the judge has to believe that, not only is success possible, but more likely than not. Here, the judge already agreed that \"that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the facts alleged by Defendants to support an emergency request fall far short of justifying such an action.\" And that the Government's action was arbitrary, capricious, or abused their discretion. Losing the TRO, while not dispositive, is a big red flag. The Government does not like to lose, and once it has lost on this metric, it's very likely that they already know they will lose on the following motions: the preliminary injunction and the permanent injunction. One problem there is discovery. As part of the process of proving the case, the Plaintiffs get to request internal communications and other materials that might show an abuse of discretion or undue influence. The Energy Information Administration has only used emergency data collection authority in a handful of actual emergencies, such as an emergency survey in response to the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Cyberattack. Given the context of Senator Warren and the Biden Administration's continued attacks on Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, is there any reason to believe that there aren't unflattering emails or communications showing undue influence between those offices and the EIA? What else could have caused a historically cautious and respected agency to suddenly put out such slipshod work as the EIA-862, which was then rubber stamped by the President's own Office of Management and Budget in clear technical violation of their internal standards? It is not like this kind of undue influence hasn't happened before... look at Custodia Bank's lawsuit, for instance, where \"perhaps the most stunning fact that would never have seen the light of day but for discovery is this: in the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse and a mysterious briefing to Vice-Chair Barr concerning Custodia\u2019s membership and master account applications, Board staff edited and rewrote key parts of an internal Kansas City Fed memo \u2026 Discovery reveals that the Board was deeply intertwined in the outcome of Custodia\u2019s master account request. That level of involvement is not consistent with the notion of unfettered Reserve Bank discretion.\" Page 54 of Custodia's December 22, 2023 Brief for Judgment as a Matter of Law. While we await more information, it seems clear that any voluntary concession by the Government here reveals some combination of realization that they exhibited either manifest incompetence, or that discovery would bear out significant undue influence on the process.

Snowden's prediction comes amid increasing institutional, retail, and nation state interest in Bitcoin, with several major corporations and investment firms allocating significant resources to the asset. While Snowden did not specify which government he believes will make the purchase, the prospect of a second national government acquiring Bitcoin and making it legal tender, like El Salvador did in 2021, would represent another huge milestone for Bitcoin. Earlier today, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele commented on Bitcoin's recent price increase, stating \"When Bitcoin\u2019s market price was low, they wrote literally thousands of articles about our supposed losses. Now that Bitcoin\u2019s market price is way up, if we were to sell, we would make a profit of over 40% (just from the market purchases), and our main source of BTC is now our citizenship program.

Other countries may be taking notice of what Bitcoin has done for El Salvador, and may want the same.

This means that the state is operating and acting in order to preserve and expand it\u2019s own power. For that reason, it is sane and reasonable to assume that state operators are in the trenches of Bitcoin attempting to influence public perception, developer activity, and overall bitcoin adoption. If you think this is not happening then you are naive or you\u2019re incentivized to act against bitcoin in a different way. The sabotage of Bitcoin is not some tin foil hat conspiracy, the sabotage of Bitcoin is actively playing out in real time, but the big question is where the sabotage is taking place and what can you do to identify and act to counter the sabotage? So let\u2019s zoom into Bitcoin of today, where conversation is happening around the future of Bitcoin in regards to dealing with Ordinals, or spam (if you are part of that camp)1. The rise of Ordinals last year and the pressure they have caused on blockspace demand has surfaced new rivalries within the bitcoin maximalist community as memetic warfare is waged on what bitcoin is and how it should be used. The purpose of this article is not to make a political stand in this fight, but to point out places in Bitcoin that are prone to sabotage and where active sabotage campaigns might be actively waged. Seeing this division in a once undivided front is enough to make one pause and consider what external forces are at work. Bitcoin\u2019s Power Balance As we consider the infighting happening within Bitcoin, it is important to understand the different parties within bitcoin and how each of the powers balance each other out. In 2019, Nic Carter illustrated Bitcoin\u2019s Power Balance Model. This model shows the key roles in Bitcoin and the relationship between each one. You can see the circular feedback loop between Miners -> Devs -> Economic Nodes. In a vacuum these three roles would perpetually pump each other with nothing to keep them in check. At the heart of the model are the Users who keep Devs and Economic nodes in check. Bitcoin\u2019s Power Balance Model by Nic Carter source. The one factor in the power model that touches each of the player in the model is the software of code. The software touches each of the roles in one way or another and this is probably the largest threat vector to all of Bitcoin. The simple activity of running code is how Bitcoin is eating the monetary world, so it is probably worth understanding the development process. Bitcoin Development Process Let\u2019s now dig into the Bitcoin development process. As you know, making changes to Bitcoin is a slow and deliberate process. This is a big change from the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d mentality of Silicon Valley. Many argue that this slow methodical process is actually one of Bitcoin\u2019s greatest strengths. In 2011, Gwern published \u201cBitcoin Is Worse Is Better\u201d where he says \u201cHowever, in an example of \u2018Worse is Better\u2019, the ugly inefficient prototype of Bitcoin successfully created a secure decentralized digital currency, which can wait indefinitely for success, and this was enough to eventually lead to adoption, improvement, and growth into a secure global digital currency.\u201d This ugly inefficient code has gotten us here today, 15 years later, and in that time the slow methodical approach to Bitcoin development has been and will probably continue to be a part of the developer ethos. The development process has even been formally documented in BIP 2 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). Here are the general steps in the BIP activation process: Drafting the BIP: The first step is to draft a BIP following the template outlined in BIP2. This includes writing a detailed document or white paper that outlines the proposed changes. The BIP should be comprehensive, covering motivation, technical specifications, and rationale. Discussion and Feedback: Once the BIP is drafted, it\u2019s shared with the Bitcoin community for discussion and feedback and usually happens on platforms like the Bitcoin Dev mailing list, GitHub, and even Twitter. The purpose is to solicit feedback, refine the proposal, and begin to build consensus around it. Assigning a BIP Number: If the BIP is deemed to have potential and is unique, it\u2019s assigned a BIP number by a BIP editor. This is a formal acknowledgment that the BIP is under consideration. Formal Review: After the BIP is assigned a number, it enters a formal review phase. During this time, the BIP is scrutinized for technical soundness, feasibility, and compatibility with the Bitcoin protocol. This is where the devs try to break the bip and poke holes in the proposal. Revisions: Based on feedback and review, the BIP may undergo several revisions. Implementation: Once consensus is reached, the BIP is implemented in the Bitcoin Core codebase. This step involves actual coding and rigorous testing to ensure that the changes work as intended without introducing new vulnerabilities. Reaching Consensus: For a BIP to move forward, it needs to reach consensus among the Bitcoin development community. This is often the most challenging part, as Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature means that a wide range of stakeholders (developers, miners, users, etc.) need to agree on the change. Deployment: After implementation & consensus, the new version of Bitcoin Core including the BIP is released. Depending on the nature of the BIP, it might require a majority of miners or nodes to upgrade to the new version for the changes to take full effect. Activation: Finally, once the required threshold of network participants has adopted the new version, the changes proposed in the BIP are activated on the Bitcoin network. Reading through this is incredibly helpful in understanding how change happens to Bitcoin. The problem I see is where are the single point of failures in this process and who the gatekeepers2 are for each step. Conversations happening in channels now are surfacing weak points or non documented parts of the development cycle. For example, Bitcoin Inquisition. This is the in space between steps 2 and 3. Bitcoin Inquisition Bitcoin Inquisition is a non-documented part of the Bitcoin development process. It was proposed by and administered by AJ Towns in 2022. Here is a very brief summary of why and what it is. \u201cI think the weakest link in that [bitcoin development] loop is the first one: what if we did activate soft forks on the default signet prior to the code being merged into core? To that end, I\u2019m proposing a fork of core that I\u2019m calling \u201cbitcoin-inquisition\u201d, with the idea that it branches from stable releases of core and adds support for proposed changes to consensus (CTV, ANYPREVOUT, TLUV, OP_CAT, etc\u2026) and potentially also relay policy (relay changes are often implied by consensus changes, but also potentially things like package relay).\u201d \u2013 AJ Towns on Bitcoin Inquisition The reality is that the Bitcoin Inquisition is live and well. AJ runs a special separate fork of Bitcoin core and acts as the sole admin for testing BIP\u2019s. This is not documented in BIP-2, but has just been accepted as process by core devs. This is a curious development of how tribal devs can make changes how they see fit, without documentation. The Bitcoin Sabotage At this point we\u2019ve run through the roles in Bitcoin, the steps in the development process, and even identified a glaring hole in the development process. Let\u2019s now dig into what is sabotage. Sabotage. (noun) /ˈsæb.ə.tɑːʒ/ Definition: The deliberate destruction, damage, or obstruction of something, typically for political or military advantage. Sabotage is often carried out covertly and with the intention of hindering operations, activities, or plans of an opponent or competitor. Verb Form: Sabotage (sabotaging, sabotaged) Usage in a Sentence: \u201cThe bridge collapse was found to be the result of sabotage by enemy agents.\u201d For purpose of this article, let\u2019s frame sabotage specifically in relation to Bitcoin Sabotage. Bitcoin Sabotage is the deliberate destruction of Bitcoin, or obstruction of Bitcoin development or adoption, for political advantage. This is the frame. This is what we are up against. With that in mind let\u2019s now dig into how sabotage is waged. Conveniently our very own CIA is masters at sabotage and have been waging sabotage tactics in warfare for over a century. Simple Sabotage Field Manual In the 1940\u2019s, the CIA shipped a field manual called Simple Sabotage Field Manual. The purpose of this was to distribute to operators a practical manual on how to conduct sabotage operations behind enemy lines. While this manual is 80 years old, it reveals some classical tactics in the art of sabotage. Click here to download your Spook handbook today! This \u201cSimple Sabotage\u201d is a unique look at how sly the military is when it comes to unconventional warfare. This manual was developed in the 1940\u2019s and you have to wonder how many more hours and resources have gone into modernizing this same document and other classified operators manuals. For purpose of this article, we will examine the Specific Suggestions for Sabotage sections focused on Organizations and Conferences & Managers and Supervisors. Organizations and Conferences Insist on doing everything through \u201cchannels.\u201d Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions. Make \u201cspeeches,\u201d Talk as frequently as possible and at great length., Illustrate your points by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate patriotic\u201d comments. When possible, refer all matters to committees, for \u201cfurther study and consideration.\u201d Attempt to make the committees as large as possible \u2013 never less than five. Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible. Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions. Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision. Advocate \u201ccaution.\u201d Be unreasonable\u201d and urge your fellow-conferees to be \u201creasonable\u201d and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on. Be worried about the propriety of any decision \u2013 raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated Hes within the jurisdiction of the group 01\u2019whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon. When I read Section A. Organizations and Conferences, I can\u2019t help but think that Bitcoin development is being sabotaged, but I am a naive outsider. I am also a noticer. If I was going to sabotage Bitcoin, this field manual could easily be deployed from within developer circles. If you were a state operator with developing skills, it is reasonable to believe you could begin participating in code review process and make in roads and start having authority in matters. Let\u2019s outline sabotage tactics state operators could be executing: Miners \u2013 in the great blocksize wars, some large mining pools signaled with the Big Blockers. This was an attack on Bitcoin, but it demonstrates a specific action that Mining Pool operators could carry out in order to sabotage Bitcoin. While this DID NOT work in breaking Bitcoin, we learned that Users are at the heart of Bitcoin. A bigger problem could be if large pool operators were acting in coordination with other roles. Devs \u2013 this is perhaps the biggest vector for sabotage attack. As we see more value soaked up by Bitcoin, it will become a bigger target for state actors. That means we will have state operators submitting pull requests and participating in the development process. Based on the Simple Sabotage Field Manual, operators could easily carry out many of the tactics outlined above. We are already seeing very divisive positions from developers on how bitcoin should be, so you must wonder who is the operator. Users \u2013 since users give feedback to developers, you would assume that giving bad feedback could lead to developers building something that is not in bitcoins best interest. Or users could socially attack developers into doing certain things. Right now we are seeing meme warfare being waged within the maximalist community, and it can\u2019t all be organic discourse. Users infighting can lead to maldevelopment. Also, what happens if a group of bad actors in the users and developers camps are aligned. Or what if users coordinate to influence certain developers? Economic Nodes \u2013 they choose what transactions make it to miners via the code they run. Users tell them what code to run because users spend money with them. Economic nodes could sabotage by supporting old code, or malicious sabotaged code. In wrapping up this piece, the complex dynamics between miners, devs, users, and economic nodes within Bitcoin creates a ripe battle ground for meme warfare and Bitcoin Sabotage. The Bitcoin development process is without flaws and as outlined in the CIA\u2019s Simple Sabotage Field Manual, there are many simple to deploy tactics that could be used to sabotage Bitcoin. This should serve as a sobering reality that Bitcoin is under attack and you should act accordingly. The responsibility is on you, humble frog, to keep your head on a swivel. You must stay aware and call out bullshit. Whether it is combating gaslighting, carrying out ethical trolling, or reviewing code, all these actions count and help preserve our only realistic shot at a more free future. The survival and flourishing of Bitcoin depend not just on NGU and its technological robustness but equally on the collective vigilance the users. As we navigate these uncertain times, let us be guided commitment to cypherpunk ethos, critical thinking, and unwavering support for the core principles that underpin Bitcoin which is freedom. In doing this, we might have a chance at winning the game of Bitcoin Sabotage and defeating our enemy, the state.","article_summary":"How would you go about sabotaging Bitcoin if you were a government agent?","creation_date":"Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:00:00 GMT","associated_tags":["Simple Sabotage Field Manual","Opinion","Government Sabotage","Culture","bitcoin development"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-sabotage-of-bitcoin","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine"},{"article_title":"Asia\u2019s crypto revolution: Web3 growth in the East","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Elaine Zhu"},"article_detailed_content":"Over the years, the Asia Pacific region (APAC) has established itself as an impressive environment for the rapidly growing technology industry. From the bustling tech hub of Singapore to the financial might of Hong Kong, the flourishing Web3 community in Vietnam, and the impressive technological creativity of Japan, APAC has consistently been at the forefront of innovation. With governments actively embracing blockchain, a highly skilled digital native population, and leading industry projects setting their sights on the region, APAC is set to lead the charge in shaping the future of Web3. Governments and Regulators Setting Pace One of the critical drivers of this journey is the progressive regulatory stance in key jurisdictions. Last year, Singapore became one of the first countries to implement stablecoin regulation. This solidifies the city-state\u2019s commitment to fostering a secure crypto ecosystem for investors and provides a blueprint for others to follow. Singapore is setting clear standards and leading by example to show the world how regulatory frameworks can bring more trust and security to the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Hong Kong is also solidifying its position as a crypto hub. Introducing a licensing regime for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and a regulatory framework for retail trading is a testament to the city\u2019s dedication to embracing the future of financial technology. Furthermore, Hong Kong has embraced blockchain technology as a major component of its financial model. Spearheaded in collaboration with the United Nations and the Bank of International Settlements, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched a groundbreaking initiative known as \u2018Project Genesis 2.0\u2018 which yielded two innovative prototypes for green bonds in 2023, successfully executing the sale of the world\u2019s inaugural tokenized green bond, valued at over $100 million USD. Japan has signaled its commitment to improving the business and regulatory environment for Web3 companies. In a speech at last year\u2019s WebX conference in Tokyo, Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida emphasized that the government intends to accommodate Web3 technologies, particularly regarding regulations around digital assets and content sharing. ] The Prime Minister emphatically stated that \u201cWeb3 is part of the new form of capitalism,\u201d leaving no doubts about the nation\u2019s fierce commitment to fostering innovation. Lastly, the approval of BTC spot ETFs in the US, stewarded by premier financial institutions such as BlackRock and Fidelity, represents a very positive milestone for the industry within American borders and could signal increased activity in APAC. Before this approval, UBS and HSBC made strides to offer customers access to new investment vehicles. With the creation of new regulated institutional products, the possibilities for increased market participation have grown exponentially. Digital Natives Leading the Way Perhaps the region\u2019s most valuable positive element is the highly skilled and motivated digital natives. For so long, institutions and society have depended on specialized technologists and developers to lead the way in the field. But now, younger generations born into a digital world are transforming how new technologies are understood, regulated, implemented, and utilized. This is most clear in the APAC region where progressive regulations, thanks to a novel working relationship between technologists, business leaders, and government officials, have resulted in a projected US $126.9 billion of spending from digital native businesses by 2026. The economic impacts of this exponential growth will be revolutionary, not only in the region but across the globe. On top of the impressive economic impacts, we can only begin to imagine how the new technologies and services created in this environment will positively impact industries from finance and banking to content sharing and entertainment. Leading Web3 Adoption in 2024? It\u2019s no secret that adopting new technologies is an intricate process that requires extensive collaboration between technologists, businesses, and policymakers. This has historically been an arduous process for the tech industry, particularly due to the complexity of the subject matter, among other factors. Consequently, the regulatory framework brought forth by policymakers is often not reflective of industry, market, or consumer needs. Around the world, governments have struggled to balance their objectives and the tech industry\u2019s needs. But, in the east, an impressive movement spearheaded by a digitally oriented population is underway \u2013 one that is successfully fostering the necessary collaboration between industry leaders and public officials while ensuring the industry continues to see the same success. For these reasons, APAC is on the brink of claiming its position as the world\u2019s important region for Web3 innovation.

Alongside the boosting from stimulus packages in 2021, venture capital (VC) firms had invested $33 billion in crypto and blockchain startups. The following year, the Federal Reserve triggered a domino of crypto bankruptcies with its interest rate hiking cycle, starting from the Terra (LUNA) crash and culminating in the FTX Ponzi scheme collapse. The promise of DeFi lost its luster, not helped by over $3 billion lost in DeFi hacks during 2023. The ongoing Bitcoin bull run shows the lack of altcoin confidence as the so-called Altcoin Season is yet to manifest. In June 2023, BlackRock\u2019s head of strategic partnerships, Joseph Chalom, noted that DeFi\u2019s institutional adoption is \u201cmany, many, many years away\u201d. However, there is a case to be made that the emerging AI narrative can fuse with blockchain technology and its applications. Taking in lessons from the previous cycle, what would that AI-crypto landscape look like? Laying the AI Foundation with Crypto Composability Looking back, it is safe to say that \u201cDeFi\u201d was subsumed by companies on top of tokenized layers, such as Celsius Network or BlockFi, rendering DeFi into CeFi. These companies successfully drove crypto adoption as such, only to end up sullying the very word \u201ccrypto\u201d. A renewed DeFi v2 should then focus on a superior user experience that doesn\u2019t spark the demand for centralized companies to make it so. Most importantly, DeFi security must be fortified. The most promising solution in that direction is the zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine \u2013 zkEVM. By abstracting chain transactions via zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), zkEVM increases network throughput and reduces gas costs. On top of that, zkEVM simplifies the user experience by facilitating alternative token payments for gas fees. In other words, zkEVM-like solutions pave the road to scalability needed for AI applications. AI applications inherently involve high volumes of data, making it a potential bottleneck for blockchain networks. With this obstacle ahead, Polygon zkEVM makes it possible to generate AI artwork via the Midjourney image generator. In this process, the results could be tokenized as NFTs with low fees. Building further on smart contracts of other kinds, the crypto space has laid the groundwork for AI with composability and permissionless access. Combined, this creates an autonomous and efficient infrastructure for financial markets. As every piece of market action can be disassembled into smart contracts, composability brings innovation across three composability layers: Morphological \u2013 components communicating between DeFi protocols, creating new meta-features. Atomic \u2013 ability for each smart contract to function independently or in conjunction with other protocols\u2019 smart contracts. Syntactic \u2013 ability for protocols to communicate based on standardized protocols. In practice, this translates to Lego DeFi bricks. For instance, Compound (COMP) allows users to supply liquidity into smart contract pools. This is one of DeFi\u2019s revolutionary pillars as users no longer require someone\u2019s permission to either loan or borrow. With smart contracts acting as liquidity pools, borrowers can tap into them by providing collateral. Liquidity providers gain cTokens in return as interest. If the supplied token is USDC, the yielding one will be cUSDC. However these tokens can be integrated across the DeFi board into all protocols compatible with the ERC-20 standard. In other words, composability creates opportunities for the multiplicity of yields, so that no smart contract is left idle. The problem is, how to efficiently handle this rise in complexity? This is where AI comes into play. Amplifying Efficiency with AI When thinking of artificial intelligence (AI), the main feature that comes to mind is superhuman processing. Financial markets have long ago become too complex for human minds to handle. Instead, humans have come to rely on predictive algorithms, automation and personalization. In TradFi, this typically translates to robo advisors prompting users on their needs and risk tolerances. A robo advisor would then generate a profile to manage the user\u2019s portfolio. In the blockchain composability arena, such AI algorithms would gain much greater flexibility to siphon yields. By reading the market conditions on the fly as they access transparent smart contracts, AI agents have the potential to reduce market inefficiencies, reduce human error, and increase market coordination. The latter already exists in the form of automated market makers (AMMs) that deliver asset price discovery. By analyzing order flows, liquidity and volatility in real-time, AI agents are ideally suited to optimize liquidity supply and even prevent DeFi flash loan exploits by coordinating between DeFi platforms and limiting transaction sizes. Inevitably, as AI agents increase market efficiency through real-time market monitoring and machine learning, new prediction markets could emerge as liquidity deepens. The job of humans would then be to set bots to arbitrate against other bots. At $42.5 billion across 2,500 equity rounds in 2023, AI investments have already outpaced the crypto peak of 2021. But which AI-crypto projects showcase the trend? Spotlight on AI-Crypto Innovators Since the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November 2022, AI has been an attention grabber. The attention previously reserved for memecoins became diverted into AI advancements in reasoning, art generation, coding and most recently, text-to-video generation via Sora. Across these fields of human interest, they all rely on the scaling of data centers. Unlike crypto tokens, which are smart contracts, AI tokens are the base blocks of text that the AI agent disassembles into relationship units. Depending on the attunement of each AI model, these tokens represent contextual windows for the relationships between concepts. For each user prompt, it is challenging to allow maximum processing capacity. When the AI model breaks the text into tokens, the output relies on the token size. In turn, the token size determines the quality of the generated content, whatever it may be. Obviously, the larger the token size, the larger the potential for an AI model to consider the greater number of concepts when generating content. Given such inherent limitations, AI tokens naturally fit blockchain tech. Just as Web3 gaming tokenizes in-game assets for decentralized ownership, tradeable currency and reward incentives, the same can be done with AI. Case in point, Fetch.AI (FET) is an open-access protocol to connect Autonomous Economic Agents, via the Open Economic Framework to the Fetch Smart Ledger. The FET token aims to monetize network transactions, pay for AI model deployment, reward network participants and pay for other services. And just as people connect with DeFi services via wallets, they can connect with Fetch.AI\u2019s agentverse with a Fetch Wallet to take advantage of deployed AI protocols. For instance, one of the many AI agents currently in beta agentverse is PDF Summarization Agent. As a prospective pathway to democratizing AI agent access and deployment, FET token has gained 300% value since the beginning of the year. According to Market Research Future, AI agents market is forecasted to grow to $110.42 billion by 2032 from $6.03 billion 2023. This represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 43.80%. Ultimately, we are likely to see an ecosystem of AI agents interacting with DeFi protocols and other services that would benefit from automating real-time decisions. This may expand to AI agents aiding self-driving EVs or even helping execute delicate surgeries and patient care. Pediatric surgeon Dr. Danielle Walsh at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine in Lexington said: \u201cA patient who wakes up at 1:00 in the morning 2 days after a surgical operation can contact the chatbot to ask, \u2018I\u2019m having this symptom, is this normal?\u2019\u201d In medical diagnostics, Massachusetts-based Lantheus Holdings (LNTH) had already deployed its PYLARIFY AI imaging agent for early prostate cancer detection. With AI-crypto projects like Fetch.AI, many such services could be tokenized to full extent. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities Ahead of AI integration, blockchain platforms face the same problem \u2013 institutional adoption. Do smaller protocols have a chance to penetrate the mainstream, or is this reserved for institutions? DeFi may have paved the way for tokenized financial markets, but big players are likelier to instill public confidence. For instance, the Canton Network, which is supported by Big Bank and Big Tech, may supplant smaller DeFi fish. Eventually, the convenience of same-day bank transfers could be seamlessly integrated into blockchain networks. This is especially pertinent given that Microsoft is powering the Canton Network with Azure cloud while developing AI products. At the same time, plenty of users would prefer to stay within open-access ecosystems, riding the value appreciation of AI-crypto tokens. Moreover, crypto protocols don\u2019t have to be directly geared toward AI agent deployment. Case in point, The Graph (GRT) could be used for AI apps as a blockchain data indexing service. Based on this speculation, this \u201cGoogle of Blockchain\u201d has gained a 103% boost year-to-date. One of the most prospective crypto projects aiding AI could be Injective Protocol (INJ). As it \u201cinjects\u201d AI algorithms into aforementioned DeFi market actions, Injective aims to simplify and automate complex DeFi operations. At the base layer of the AI-crypto intersection could be Allora Network, using its zero-knowledge machine learning (zkML) and federated learning to build AI apps for augmented DeFi experience. If the rollout of these open apps is successful, institutional networks such as Canton would have diminished appeal. This dynamic will largely depend on regulatory agencies, which are yet to materialize rules even for the crypto space. Conclusion AI is poised to make data more intelligible, actionable and pertinent to a specific user. On the other hand, blockchain technology formalized and decentralized the logic of human action into self-executing smart contracts. When the two spheres meet, we get AI agents with a renewed purpose. A new generation of tokenized robo-advisors that take full advantage of DeFi composability. And as AI agents explore new possibilities, new markets will emerge. From predictive analysis to injecting liquidity into on-chain markets, AI agents are ready to craft a hyper-financialized future where, starting from Bitcoin itself, humans will encounter plenty of building blocks to capitalize on.

Across the board, since the sector\u2019s peak on March 9, Fetch is down 4%, ICP is down 11%, The Graph is down 12%, Singularity is down 13%, and Bittensor is down 12.8%. Top AI coins fall in past days (Source: TradingView) While the rise of AI in 2023 saw an influx of new AI-related memecoins and hype projects, those currently sitting toward the top of the sector chart are primarily focused on real-life implementation of decentralized AI tooling. The work has attracted the attention of Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin, Erik Voorhees, and other notable players in the crypto space. The importance of decentralized AI models likely aligns with that of decentralized finance as the progress of AI development continues to ramp up. Blockchain and tokenization appear solid bedfellows for a distributed AI network, indicating the recent retracement is possibly profit-taking rather than investors losing faith in the burgeoning sector. However, with such rapid gains, it is also likely that investors will be eager to see progress in delivering technology. Many of the top progress have live mainnets with projects actively building. The critical next step is to see whether a network effect can bring users on chain to engage with this fascinating cross-section of AI and blockchain. Bittensor, for one, is undoubtedly seeing demand for adoption as the cost to register one of its 32 subnets has risen from around $200,000 to over $5 million this month alone, with the price set by market forces rather than any centralized entity.

Based on snapshots from Archive.org, the venture firm added the disclaimer in late February: \u201cBinance Labs is an independent venture and not part of the Binance Group nor is it involved in any of the businesses operated by the Binance Group (including but not limited to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange).\u201d The spin-off is one of the most significant decisions made under the exchange\u2019s new CEO, Richard Teng, since taking over four months ago. He previously headed the exchange\u2019s Singapore division and has no publicly listed role at Binance Labs. The companies did not respond to a request for comment as of press time, and the reasons behind the decision to split the venture capital division are unclear. Licensing the brand Binance Labs Investment Director Alex Odagiu told Bloomberg that the venture capital firm operates independently but will continue to use the Binance brand name under a licensing agreement. Despite its newfound independence, Binance Labs remains dedicated to its foundational mission of discovering and investing in promising crypto projects. Odagiu reaffirmed the commitment, stressing that the venture\u2019s focus on supporting innovation within the blockchain ecosystem remains unchanged. The separation entails distinct contractual agreements for Binance Labs staff, mirroring the organizational structure seen in other Binance-supported entities such as the BNB Chain. Bloomberg identified the value of Binance Labs as close to $10 billion. The company\u2019s website indicates that it has supported more than 200 crypto projects over six years. Its portfolio notably includes the top-twenty market cap blockchain Polygon, the metaverse-focused platform The Sandbox, and the decentralized finance platform CurveFi.

The US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York filed a sentencing memorandum detailing SBF\u2019s wide-ranging fraudulent activities on March 15. According to the filing, his malpractices not only undermined the integrity of the financial and political systems but also left tens of thousands of victims across several continents grappling with significant losses. Greed and ambition The government\u2019s filing paints a picture of SBF as a figure driven by unparalleled greed and ambition, whose actions reached into the political arena through unlawful contributions and even extended overseas with attempts to bribe Chinese government officials. Beyond the financial deceit at FTX and Alameda Research, a trading firm he founded, SBF was also involved in banking misconduct, including operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and misleading banks to facilitate his operations. In the aftermath of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, SBF attempted to deflect blame and evade responsibility, further complicating the legal proceedings and highlighting a persistent refusal to acknowledge the scope of his wrongdoing. The prosecutors also outlined instances of obstruction of justice, including his use of encrypted messaging to delete evidence and tampering with witnesses. Extraordinary punishment for extraordinary crimes The request for a 40 to 50-year sentence emphasizes the severity of SBF\u2019s actions and reflects the prosecution\u2019s stance on the need for a punishment that matches the extraordinary impact of his crimes. The memorandum argues that such a sentence is necessary not only to provide justice for the victims but also to serve as a deterrent against similar crimes in the rapidly evolving crypto sector. In addition to the prison term, the government is seeking forfeiture of assets acquired through the criminal activities and has proposed victim compensation through remission as an alternative to traditional restitution. This approach aims to address the financial harm suffered by the victims, some of whom lost their life savings in the collapse of FTX. SBF\u2019s sentencing is set for March 28, marking a pivotal moment in bringing justice to the thousands of FTX customers who were wronged.

This achievement surpasses its prior peak market cap of approximately $77.9 billion \u2014 observed in November 2021 at its all-time high of $259.96 \u2014 signaling strong investor confidence and a growing interest in the digital asset. SOL was trading at $181.35 as of press time \u2014 up 9.29% over the past 24 hours, with a market cap hovering just above $80 billion, according to CryptoSlate data. Sol ecosystem thriving Adding to Solana\u2019s impressive week, the network saw a record-breaking number of new addresses, with a daily average of 738,040 new addresses based on a seven-day moving average. This uptick in new addresses highlights the growing community and interest in the Solana ecosystem, which saw a green day of trading, with most tokens recording significant gains. DEX native tokens \u2014 including Raydium and the recently launched Jupiter and Jito \u2014 saw double-digit gains over the past day. RAY and JUP were up more than 30%, while JITO recorded gains 10%. Meanwhile, the largest Solana-based memecoins like WIF and BONK saw a drawdown mimicking the wider market as investors turned to smaller cap tokens on DEXs amid renewed memecoin frenzy. Memecoin fever The current enthusiasm surrounding Solana is largely fueled by the vibrant trading activity related to newly launched memecoins on the network following a dramatic surge in memecoins this year. Noteworthy gains were observed in memecoins like Dogwifhat, Popcat, and Bonk, which have posted gains ranging from 117% to 554% over the past 30 days. This surge in memecoin activity has drawn considerable attention to Solana, highlighting its utility and growing relevance in the crypto space. The appeal of memecoins on the Solana network has been attributed to their accessibility and entertainment value. The trend reflects a broader interest in engaging with the crypto market in a fun and accessible manner.

XRP Trading Volume Surges, But Will Price Follow? XRP witnessed a surge earlier in the week which saw it breaking out of a 6-year-long symmetrical triangle, prompting analysts to anticipate a continued price surge. During this period, the crypto witnessed a surge in trading volume from whales in particular, with large bouts of XRP leaving crypto exchanges. This bullish sentiment allowed XRP to cross over $0.74 for the first time in eight months, albeit for a short moment.

The major resistance level to watch is $0.74. XRP tested this level a few days ago but failed to close above it. If bullish momentum continues and volume stays strong, XRP could break through $0.74 decisively in the new week. If it does, the next resistance levels are at $0.82 and $1.5.

The price of Bitcoin has retreated violently to a weekly low of $67,500 after a few days of showing remarkable advances and setting new all-time highs. The altcoins have experienced a significant decline as well, resulting in nearly 200,000 traders making liquidations during the last 24 hours. The weekend brought a tremor to the cryptocurrency market, with a sudden price correction causing short-term panic and hundreds of millions in liquidated positions. However, despite the wobble, analysts are divided on whether this signifies a broader market shift or a mere blip on the bullish radar. Crypto Long Squeeze Triggers Liquidations Over a 24-hour period ending Friday, March 15th, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization shed a cool 6%. This triggered a wave of automated liquidations, particularly for investors holding leveraged long positions \u2013 essentially large bets on rising prices. According to Coinglass, a crypto data analysis platform, over $800 million worth of long positions were liquidated across the market. Bitcoin itself bore the brunt of the selling pressure, dipping as low as $67,000 \u2013 its lowest point in over a week. The pain wasn\u2019t evenly distributed. Over one third of the liquidations, a total of $660 million, came from long positions on Bitcoin. Altcoin Bloodbath Follows Bitcoin\u2019s Lead The tremors weren\u2019t confined to Bitcoin. The correction spilled over to the altcoin market, with popular tokens like Cardano, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and XRP all experiencing significant price drops. This, in turn, triggered further liquidations for long positions held on these altcoins. XRP traders alone saw over $10 million liquidated, with nearly $11 million coming from long positions. Crypto Market Fights Back: Buying The Dip Despite the week\u2019s fright, the overall sentiment in the crypto market remains surprisingly bullish. This is primarily fueled by the swift buying activity observed at key support levels as prices dipped. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most sought-after crypto asset, for example, has already staged a partial recovery, bouncing back to a little over $69,000 at the time of writing. Similar rebounds have been observed across several altcoins, suggesting that investors might be viewing this as a buying opportunity. This correction can be seen as a healthy market reset after a strong rally, some analysts say. While some leveraged positions got burned, the fact that investors are stepping in to buy the dip indicates continued confidence in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. A Continued Balancing Act The weekend\u2019s events serve as a microcosm of the ongoing struggle within the crypto market. On one hand, there\u2019s a growing sense of institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance, fueling a bullish sentiment. On the other, the inherent volatility of crypto assets continues to pose a challenge, with sudden price swings capable of inflicting significant losses on unsuspecting investors.

Meanwhile, Marathon Digital, one of the largest US-based Bitcoin mining companies, is preparing to acquire more power infrastructure and streamline operations to meet the challenges posed by a reduction in revenue due to the upcoming April halving event. Bitcoin Miners Brace For Post-Halving Shakeout According to a Bloomberg report, Marathon Digital plans to acquire additional power infrastructure and expand its mining capacity to keep costs low and maintain profitability. By optimizing operations and scaling up, Marathon aims to mitigate the impact of the impending revenue drop and secure wider margins in the post-halving landscape. Marathon Digital recently announced an agreement to purchase a 200-megawatt data center in Garden City, Texas, for over $87 million. This acquisition marks the company\u2019s second major investment in power infrastructure after it acquired multiple sites for $179 million earlier this year. By increasing its ownership of mining capacity infrastructure to 53%, up from a meager 3% in the previous year, Marathon is positioning itself for greater operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness, Bloomberg notes. However, post-halving, the Bitcoin mining industry is expected to undergo significant changes, with some miners facing profitability challenges and potential exits. Profitability Crisis Looms Marathon Digital\u2019s CEO, Fred Thiel, highlights the impact of revenue reduction, estimating that the industry\u2019s average break-even point will rise from around $23,000 per Bitcoin to approximately $43,000. Thiel stated: Post halving, there will be some miners to lose profitability, maybe challenged, or maybe looking for an exit as their revenues will drop because of the Bitcoin rewarded will drop. The simple math is, if the industry average break-even point was around $23,000 per Bitcoin, it will now go up to around $43,000. It is worth noting that this does not necessarily mean that Bitcoin\u2019s price will fall to $43,000 from its current trading price of $69,300. The breakeven price refers to the price at which miners like Marathon Digital can cover their operating costs and achieve profitability. It is not directly correlated to the market price of Bitcoin. As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $69,300 and is on the verge of reclaiming the significant milestone of $70,000. The cryptocurrency experienced a notable spike in volatility during the early hours of Friday\u2019s trading session but has since recovered, mitigating its losses from 8% down to 2.5%.

Bullish Indications From Bitcoin Futures Deribit\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer, Luuk Strijers, has highlighted the current state of the Bitcoin futures basis, which ranges between 18% to 25% annually, a rate reminiscent of the market conditions in 2021. According to Strijers\u2019s comment, this elevated basis is not just a number but a lucrative opportunity for derivatives traders.

Strijers further noted that this strategy is particularly appealing in the current climate, fueled by the influx of new investments following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and anticipation surrounding the Bitcoin halving event.

Rekt Capital, a respected figure in crypto analysis, views the recent price correction as a \u201cpositive adjustment\u201d preceding the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving in April. Halving events, which reduce the block reward for miners, thus slowing the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation, have traditionally catalyzed significant price rallies due to the resulting supply constraints.

This profit surge reflects improved asset prices and market sentiment compared to 2022. Although this figure falls short of the $159.7 billion gains witnessed during the 2021 bull market, it signifies a significant recovery from the estimated losses of $127.1 billion experienced in 2022. Sharp Surge In Crypto Gains The report suggests that despite similar growth rates in crypto asset prices in 2021 and 2023, the total gains for the latter year were lower. According to Chainalysis, this discrepancy could potentially be attributed to investors\u2019 decreased inclination to convert their crypto assets into cash. The analysis further suggests that investors in 2023 seem to have anticipated further price increases, as crypto asset prices did not exceed previous all-time highs (ATHs) during the year, unlike in 2021. Cryptocurrency gains remained relatively consistent throughout 2023, except for two consecutive months of losses in August and September, as seen in the image above. However, gains surged sharply thereafter, with November and December eclipsing all previous months. United States Leads Leading the pack in cryptocurrency gains was the United States, with an estimated $9.36 billion in profits in 2023. The United Kingdom secured the second position with an estimated $1.39 billion in crypto gains. Notably, several upper and lower-middle-income countries, particularly in Asia, such as Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and India, achieved significant gains, each surpassing $1 billion and ranking within the top six countries worldwide. Chainalysis had previously observed strong cryptocurrency adoption in these income categories, particularly in \u201clower-middle-income\u201d countries, which demonstrated resilience even during the recent bear market. The gains estimates indicate that investors in these countries have reaped substantial benefits from embracing the asset class. Ultimately, the Chainalysis report suggests that the positive trends observed in 2023 have carried over into 2024, with prominent cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) hitting all-time highs of $73,700 following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and increased institutional adoption. If these trends persist, the firm believes that it is conceivable that gains in 2024 will align more closely with those witnessed in 2021.

The data is from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, which has used on-chain data to determine the average acquisition price for any given address based on when its coins moved into its balance. In the chart, the size of the dots represents the amount of coins that have their cost basis inside the corresponding range. It would appear that the $64,743 and $66,700 range is below the current price that hosts the cost basis of a significant amount of addresses. More particularly, 382,000 addresses acquired 275,450 BTC at these levels. As the Bitcoin spot price is currently trading above this range, all these investors would naturally be carrying some profits. Generally, investors are sensitive to retests of their cost basis, as such retests can potentially flip their profit-loss status.

Deaton is presenting a Republican challenge to senator Warren, giving the prominent progressive her first serious, albeit still remote, opponent and setting up an election-season dispute over cryptocurrencies. Deaton\u2019s Campaign Gains Momentum With Crypto Community Support Deaton\u2019s announcement has ignited a surge of support from the crypto community, with many prominent figures expressing their endorsement and willingness to contribute to his campaign. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was among the first to step forward, donating the maximum allowable amount of $3,300. Deaton\u2019s campaign has also embraced crypto donations, allowing supporters to contribute using various cryptocurrencies. I put in $500K of my own money because I know I can win.

He highlights several factors that indicate Warren\u2019s vulnerability, including her low favorability ratings and the fact that a significant portion of eligible voters in Massachusetts are neither Democrats nor Republicans. Deaton believes these factors, coupled with his strong support from the crypto community, give him a fighting chance to unseat the incumbent senator. XRP Community Speculates On Deaton\u2019s Potential Impact On Crypto Regulation While Deaton\u2019s campaign primarily focuses on challenging Warren\u2019s anti-crypto stance, the XRP community is abuzz with speculation about the potential implications of his victory for the ongoing Ripple lawsuit. Deaton\u2019s extensive legal experience and vocal support for the crypto industry have led many to believe that his election could positively influence the outcome of the case. However, it remains uncertain whether Deaton\u2019s involvement in the Senate race will directly impact the Ripple lawsuit. Deaton\u2019s Fundraising Efforts And Campaign Strategy To bolster his campaign\u2019s financial resources, Deaton has set an ambitious goal of raising $1 million by March 31st. He has turned to his substantial social media following, primarily crypto enthusiasts, to contribute to the cause. Deaton\u2019s campaign strategy emphasizes the importance of freedom and the need for nonpartisan leadership in Washington that represents the interests of ordinary citizens. He believes that his outsider status and willingness to challenge the status quo resonate with voters disillusioned with traditional politics. Media Attention And Recognition Of Deaton\u2019s Challenge Deaton\u2019s candidacy has garnered significant media attention, with outlets such as Fox Business recognizing him as a major challenger who poses a genuine threat to Warren\u2019s re-election bid. His campaign has successfully captured the public\u2019s imagination, and his message of freedom and crypto advocacy has struck a chord with many voters. As the race heats up, it remains to be seen whether Deaton\u2019s grassroots campaign can overcome the challenges posed by Warren\u2019s incumbency and political establishment support.

This action has negatively affected the meme coin\u2019s price, which has been on a downward trend since then. Dogecoin Whale Offloads 86 Million DOGE On-chain data shows that the crypto trader deposited 86 million DOGE into the crypto exchange Robinhood in an effort to profit from the meme coin\u2019s recent price surge. The whale, however, looks to be bullish on the meme coin in the long term, as they have since repurchased a significant amount of DOGE and still hold a substantial amount of it. Meanwhile, due to the size of such a sale, the price of Dogecoin has since dipped and is currently on a downward trend. Before now, Dogecoin and other meme coins had led other altcoins, making significant gains in these past few weeks. As such, it is understandable that the Dogecoin whale in question seized the opportunity to take some profits. This week has been one of profit-taking from the meme coin ecosystem. Bitcoinist reported on Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE whales that earned a realized gain of $48.105 million and $3.364 million from offloading their meme coin holdings. This wave of profit-taking has partly contributed to the significant drop in the prices of the foremost meme coins, DOGE and SHIB, with both crypto tokens down over 6% and 18% in the last seven days. However, Solana-based meme coins have upheld the broader meme coin ecosystem, with these crypto tokens pulling astonishing numbers for crypto investors. Book of Meme (BOME) stands out, seeing the growth that it has recorded since launching just this week. It rose to a $1 billion market cap and has been listed on major crypto exchanges. More Profit Taking From Meme Coin Traders On-chain analysis platform Spot On Chain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post a crypto trader who recently made millions of dollars from their SHIB investment. This trader had purchased 1.741 trillion SHIB (average price of $0.000009272) for $16.146 million and sold all of them for $39.668 million (average price of $0.00002278), realizing a gain of $23.5 million. This same trader is also said to have just realized $46.53 million in profits from FLOKI and BIGTIME. Meanwhile, Spot On Chain noted that smart traders, including MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen, have taken profits from SHIB in the past week, which has caused it to dip significantly.

In a video release also featuring the company\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Greg Davis, Buckley highlighted reasons backing Vanguard\u2019s decision to be a non-partaker in the bubbling Bitcoin ETF market. Bitcoin Too Volatile, Not Worthy Of Long-Term Investment: Vanguard Boss According to Buckley, Vanguard has been receiving numerous inquiries on the potential of the company finally offering a spot Bitcoin ETF. This development is quite unsurprising following the company\u2019s prominent anti-crypto stance, which draws much attention due to its status as the second-largest asset manager in the world. Following the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10 by the US Securities and Exchange (SEC), Vanguard, alongside fellow investment firm Merrill Lynch were two major financial players to deny access to these novel investment funds inviting much criticism from their customers and industry figures such as Ark Invest\u2019s CEO Cathie Wood. Explaining Vanguard\u2019s stance against offering Bitcoin ETFs, Buckley stated that the cryptocurrency operated as a speculative asset unsuitable for long-term investment and not in tandem with the company\u2019s investment model. In buttressing this point, the Vanguard boss made reference to Bitcoin\u2019s decline following a crash in the stock markets. Buckley said: Something like bitcoin is just too volatile and it\u2019s not a store of value. It hasn\u2019t been and it\u2019s very volatile. When stocks got hammered in the recent crisis, bitcoin went right with them. And so it is speculative. Really tough to think about how it belongs in a long-term portfolio. The Vanguard CEO also stated that they preferred to invest in assets with tangible \u201cunderlying cash flow\u201d similar to stocks or bonds, a criteria they believe Bitcoin does not currently meet. In all, Buckley restated the investment company\u2019s decision to abstain from spot Bitcoin ETF barring a change in the cryptocurrency\u2019s asset class. Bitcoin ETF Demand Surges On Amidst Vanguard\u2019s conservative stance, some other asset managers have embraced spot Bitcoin ETFs, recognizing as they look to offer diverse investments catering to all their client\u2019s unique needs. Most recently, San Diego based financial firm Cetera announced the adoption of four BTC ETFs as part of investment options. Furthermore, Patient Capital, a $1.8 Billion asset manager, has petitioned the SEC for approval to convert up to 15% of its holdings to Bitcoin ETFs. These developments are highly exciting for the crypto community as the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs was expected to drive up institutional demand for the crypto\u2019s largest asset. So far, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have put on a stunning performance gaining a total net flow of $11.95 billion over the last two months of trading. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at $69,260.35 as the crypto market leader attempts a market rebound following a price correction in the last two days.","article_summary":"Vanguard Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley has once again reiterated the investment giant\u2019s stance against the adoption of spot Bitcoin ETF.

Bitcoin\u2019s Rocky Ride Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has experienced a notable correction, shedding over 9% of its value, a significant downturn from its recent peak of $73,600. This correction has sent shockwaves throughout the broader crypto market, causing major altcoins to similarly plummet in value. Navigating Market Volatility In the face of this volatility, analysts like Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, have stepped forward to provide guidance to investors. Marszalek emphasizes the importance of adopting a long-term perspective when it comes to holding Bitcoin, advising against succumbing to panic amidst short-term fluctuations. \u201cI think you would see a steady ramp-up, and that\u2019s what we want. As the size of the market and the increasing liquidity happens, you will see lots of sudden moves,\u201d said @cryptocom CEO @kris on #BTC. \u201cThis is an asset that you want to hold for decades, not for days or weeks.\u201d pic.twitter.com/GlMiDBEYKa \u2014 Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) March 15, 2024 Understanding The Forces At Play Examining the reasons behind Bitcoin\u2019s recent rollercoaster ride, Marszalek sheds light on the role of Bitcoin ETFs in propelling the cryptocurrency to new heights. These inflows have presented a supply-side challenge, contributing to the recent surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price. However, he also points to the Options Market as a significant factor influencing the recent downturn, highlighting the complexities at play in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Enduring Value Of Bitcoin During a recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Marszalek shared his insights on Bitcoin\u2019s enduring value amidst market volatility. He emphasized that Bitcoin is not a short-term investment but rather an asset to be held for decades, likening it to a digital gold standard. This steadfast belief in Bitcoin\u2019s enduring value echoes sentiments shared by many within the cryptocurrency community. Looking Ahead As Bitcoin continues to navigate the choppy waters of market volatility, analysts anticipate a gradual uptrend in its price trajectory. Marszalek predicts that as the market matures and liquidity increases, sudden and drastic price movements will become less frequent, providing a more stable investment environment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While the recent correction in Bitcoin\u2019s price may have rattled some investors, industry experts like Marszalek advocate for maintaining a steady hand and focusing on the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin continues to assert its position as a digital store of value, navigating market volatility with patience and foresight remains paramount for investors looking to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.

This development comes as the sentencing of the former crypto billionaire is slated for later this month. Prosecutors Says Sam Bankman-Fried Deserves 50 Years In Prison According to a memorandum submitted on Friday, March 15, to Judge Lewis Kaplan, the prosecutors are proposing a sentence of between 40 to 50 years for Bankman-Fried. The FTX founder faces up to 100 years in prison after he was found guilty of all the seven fraud charges leveled against him. The lawyers mentioned that SBF masterminded one of the largest fraudulent schemes in recent years, repeatedly comparing his actions to those of Bernie Madoff. Madoff was an American financier who allegedly ran the largest known Ponzi scheme in history, worth an estimated $65 billion. Considering the magnitude and duration of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s financial misdeeds, the prosecutors believe a sentence of 40 to 50 years is \u201csufficiently severe\u201d to deter others from committing such crimes. \u201cAnd that will permit the defendant to return to liberty only after society can be assured that he will not have the opportunity to turn back to fraud and deceit,\u201d they added. The government\u2019s attorneys also emphasized in the 116-page court document how remorseless the former FTX boss has been about his fraudulent activities. \u201cEven now Bankman-Fried refuses to admit what he did wrong,\u201d a part of the memorandum read. Interestingly, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal counsel proposed to the court that the defendant get a sentence between five years and six and a half years. According to the lawyers, the purpose of a jail term in SBF\u2019s case should be rehabilitation and not punishment. Another Exchange In The Works? The prosecutors revealed to the court in their sentencing memorandum that Sam Bankman-Fried could launch a new cryptocurrency exchange, saying he had weighed starting an exchange called \u201cArchangel LTD.\u201d According to the lawyers, the former FTX CEO also considered different options to launder his image. Amongst the cited options were media and PR stunts, like \u201cfocus on the fact that the Chapter 11 team has no idea how to run FTX,\u201d push a \u201cpro crypto, pro freedom\u201d agenda, or \u201cgo on Tucker Carlsen.\u201d Ultimately, the prosecutors concluded that Sam Bankman-Fried is deserving of a \u201csevere sanction, proportionate to his role in this historic fraud.\u201d A sentence of 40 to 50 years is believed to be the right perfect judgment in this case.","article_summary":"The prosecutors in the fraud case against the former CEO of the now-defunct FTX exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), have now suggested a jail sentence to the court.

OSL Exec Shares Details","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Rubmar Garcia"},"article_detailed_content":"OSL Group executive Gary Tiu recently joined Bloomberg\u2019s \u2018The China Show\u2019 to discuss the spot Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) landscape in Hong Kong. During the interview, Tiu also spoke about the prospect of a spot Ethereum ETFs launch in the future. When Are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Launching In Hong Kong? Gary Tiu, OSL\u2019s Executive Director and Head of Regulatory Affairs, spoke with Yvonne Man and Annabelle Droulers about the digital asset firm\u2019s expectation for spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong and the preparations regarding the investment products. The executive shared a prediction of when the ETFs will be launched in the interview. Despite not giving an exact timeline, Tiu feels optimistic and considers that the initiatives on spot Bitcoin ETF \u201cthat are being talked about\u201d will hit the market in the next few months. After the successful launch of ETFs in the US, interest in these products has soared from traditional investors and institutions. Some of the interest has been focused on other countries\u2019 options to launch a Bitcoin ETF and whether the US regulator will approve other crypto-based Exchange-Traded Products. Regarding the anticipation around the launch of a spot Ethereum ETF worldwide, the executive deems the race as \u201cmore interesting\u201d since the product is yet to be approved in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): I think there\u2019s definitely a more global race on now for who can actually come to the market with the first product. A lot of the issues we talk about are sensitive to market timing. Being first to market is going to be critical for the players that are investing in that space. How Is The OSL Group Preparing For An ETF Launch? The OSL executive considers that there will be a lot of investor interest in Bitcoin ETFs if launched in Hong Kong. Based on US interests and developments, the digital asset company is taking note of the substantial effort that\u2019s been put into the products and the infrastructure needed to \u201cget an ETF out.\u201d Moreover, Tiu commented on the readiness and broadness of Hong Kong\u2019s ecosystem to advert a \u201cconcentration risk\u201d as the legal framework for the ETFs will \u201crely on Hong Kong\u2019s licensed companies.\u201d The executive believes that OSL Group is ready as it has been operating for over three years as a licensed platform. Tiu highlights that OSL isn\u2019t the only licensed company in the market. However, he considers that what\u2019s most important for a successful ETF is a competitive landscape with incentivized market makers: So, I guess from another perspective, the ETF isn\u2019t even just about the trading platforms that have to support the product. The market makers are the ones who support liquidity on the exchange. (\u2026) We want market makers to be properly incentivized so that they can do very, very tight pricing on the exchange because really that\u2019s how ETFs are distributed on the market. Additionally, the Head of Research commented on the general operating model that will differentiate the US ETFs from Hong Kong\u2019s, considering that these differences will give them an edge regarding fees and execution costs: The Hong Kong operating model will allow the fund to directly receive BTC from subscribers and to pay out crypto assets or bitcoin in the case of the first products to pay out bitcoin to the investors in the case of redemptions. So, this potentially does give the Hong Kong products a bit of an edge in terms of lowering execution costs. As opposed to having to always go into the market to buy, they can directly receive the bitcoin from investors.

The move aims to strengthen investor protection against \u201crug pulls,\u201d or fraudulent tokens, and address concerns about the alleged \u201clack of oversight\u201d of token listings in the crypto industry. According to Bloomberg, the changes began rolling out late last year, including a longer \u201ccliff period\u201d during which coins cannot be sold, increased allocation of coins to market makers, and the introduction of security deposits. Binance Extends \u201cCliff Period\u201d To A Year During the cliff period, a portion of the total coin supply is locked up in a smart contract, gradually releasing tokens according to a vesting schedule. Binance now requests projects to agree to cliff periods of at least a year, up from a maximum of six months. The exchange also seeks a greater share of tradable tokens to be set aside for market makers to ensure sufficient liquidity. Binance\u2019s stricter rules have not yet impacted its share of spot crypto trading, as the platform has been recovering from a yearlong slide. The exchange has also maintained its lead in token listings among major exchanges. However, some executives involved in listings on Binance have expressed concerns about the changes, citing potential threats to profitability and increased burdens associated with listing new tokens. Binance\u2019s recent emphasis on investor protections over attracting coin listings reflects its response to regulatory pressure and a commitment to prioritize user safety and security. The crypto industry faces increasing scrutiny from regulators. Binance, which previously agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine for alleged money-laundering violations, aims to address regulatory concerns while maintaining its position in the market. The new listing requirements are communicated verbally to participants and may vary between deals. Binance denies imposing lock-in periods for listed projects, stating that each project independently decides its token vesting schedule. The exchange confirms the introduction of security deposits, which can be withheld if listing conditions are unmet. Reward For Information On Corruption Token listings are crucial in boosting trading volumes and generating commissions for exchanges. Binance, under the leadership of CEO Richard Teng, has extended its lead in coin listings this year, accounting for approximately 40% of the total across major marketplaces. Teng, who succeeded co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), aims to strengthen compliance efforts and collaborate more closely with global regulators. Yi He, one of Binance\u2019s co-founders, oversees overhauling the token listing process to address concerns over transparency and internal management. According to Bloomberg, Yi He recently offered a reward for information about verified corruption among Binance staff and emphasized the importance of confidentiality within the team responsible for coin listings. As the exchange tightens its token-listing requirements, it aims to balance fostering innovation and ensuring investor protection. The crypto industry continues to evolve in response to regulatory scrutiny, and exchanges like Binance are adapting their practices to meet emerging challenges. As of the current time, Binance Coin (BNB), the exchange\u2019s native token, has rebounded to reach the $600 price level after experiencing a significant dip that briefly pushed the token down to $543. This sudden drop triggered liquidations totaling nearly $7 million within the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data.

Indeed, Solana\u2019s SOL token has emerged as one of the best performers, rising by around 30% during the past month to around $190. Solana\u2019s DeFi Soars to All-Time High Solana\u2019s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has flourished with the broader crypto market rally since the year\u2019s outset. Data from DeFiLlama illustrates this trend, revealing an extraordinary surge in Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) activity. Over the past 24 hours alone, daily transaction volume has surpassed an impressive $3.6 billion, establishing a new all-time high. This remarkable upswing in Solana DEX transactions can be primarily attributed to two key factors. One is the network\u2019s commendably low transaction fees, and the second is the rising popularity of meme coins. Noteworthy meme coins like Wen, Dogwifhat, Bonk, and Book of Meme (BOME) have recently witnessed substantial trading volumes and interest.

Orca leads with $1.64 billion in trading volume over the past 24-hour period, followed by Raydium at $867 million and Lifinity at $679 million. Meanwhile, the total value of assets locked on the Solana network is also at a two-year high of almost $4 billion. DeFi analyst Patrick Scott pointed out an interesting fact. Solana DeFi TVL, including liquid staking, flipped the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for the first time during the past day. \u201cIn 2023, Solana DeFi was declared dead. Since then, its TVL is up 18x.

The firm amended its proposal to uplift its Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF that would be listed and traded on NYSE Arca. Grayscale Amends Ethereum ETF Filing Grayscale argued that since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) already approved Ethereum futures ETFs, it should also sanction ETFs providing direct exposure to spot Ethereum. The company asserted that the surveillance conducted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on the Ethereum market was sufficient to safeguard against fraud and manipulation. It further supported its argument by referencing Coinbase\u2019s correlation analysis, demonstrating a strong market correlation between Ethereum\u2019s spot and futures markets. \u201cHaving approved ETH futures ETFs in part on the basis of such surveillance, the Commission has clearly determined that CME surveillance can detect spot-market fraud that would affect spot ETPs, and the Sponsor thus believes that it must also approve spot ETH ETPs on that basis,\u201d Grayscale concluded. Craig Salm, Grayscale\u2019s Chief Legal Officer, highlighted the anticipated widespread interest in a spot Ethereum ETF. \u201cInvestors want and deserve access to Ethereum in the form of a spot Ethereum ETF and we believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,\u201d Salm added. Grayscale\u2019s Ethereum Trust is the world\u2019s largest investment fund, managing assets worth $11.8 billion, equivalent to 2.5% of all ETH in circulation. The planned transition to an ETF would unlock over $1.73 billion in value. What Are the Chances of an Approval? Grayscale\u2019s modified filing coincided with diminishing hopes for regulatory clearance for an Ethereum ETF. BeInCrypto reported earlier this week, citing Polymarket\u2019s prediction market, that the likelihood stood at 36%. Presently, the odds have slipped further to 26%. This shift can be linked to a recent communique from two US senators urging the SEC to cease approval for additional crypto ETFs, citing potential risks to retail investors. They argue that cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum lack adequate trading volumes and integrity to sustain linked ETFs.

Starting strong with solid tokenomics, ScapesMania seeks to merge casual gaming and crypto, providing benefits for both gamers and token holders. Today, amidst another surge in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) is once again leading the rally with altcoins closely following suit. Analysts in the crypto sphere are forecasting an imminent altcoin season, with gaming tokens poised to take center stage. Projections from experts indicate that the gaming token niche, rapidly expanding, could potentially hit $90.51 billion by 2031. Initial Post-Listing Performance After a highly successful presale, which garnered over $6,125,000 and swiftly attracted 18,400 holders, ScapesMania made its debut on the exchange on March 6, 2024. Now, the ecosystem\u2019s native token, MANIA, is available for trading on PancakeSwap, a leading decentralized exchange boasting a staggering 1 million monthly users. Trading commenced with MANIA/WBNB and MANIA/USDT liquidity pairs, with USDT selected as the primary liquidity source in response to community preferences. The first day of trading proved impressive. The token price has held strong. Within the first 24 hours, the number of holders stabilized at 18,410, while the trading volume surged to $2.26 million. Following this, ScapesMania promptly ascended to the top of DEXTools\u2019 Hot Pairs list. What is ScapesMania? In crypto gaming, there often exists a disconnect between projects and their intended audience. Crypto enthusiasts are drawn by the potential for gains, while gamers simply desire an enjoyable gaming experience without the complexities of cryptocurrency. When this divide remains unaddressed, both players and token holders tend to disengage from projects. ScapesMania tackles these challenges by venturing into the casual gaming realm. It introduces a unique system that caters to both traditional gamers and crypto enthusiasts. This means players can jump into gaming without worrying about understanding crypto intricacies, while holders can actively shape the ecosystem\u2019s growth and reap rewards without the need to actively play. What is MANIA Token? The MANIA token boasts a multitude of functionalities, including: DAO Governance: As the project progresses, it aims to transition into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by the community. Token Staking: Holders have the option to stake their MANIA tokens, thereby scoring rewards in the form of additional tokens. Engagement Rewards: Members can acquire tokens by engaging in a range of community activities. In-game Assets: Once game development is finalized, players will gain the ability to utilize MANIA tokens for acquiring in-game assets. In-game Rewards: Players will also have the opportunity to unlock token rewards by taking part in in-game tournaments, events, and other activities. Ecosystem Currency: The MANIA token is crafted for utilization across multiple projects within the ecosystem, thereby facilitating market expansion and increasing potential gains with the introduction of new games. What Makes ScapesMania Stand Out? MANIA tokenomics are meticulously balanced, featuring both a cliff and vesting. For holders, scheduled vesting means maintaining stability through keeping supply and demand in check. Moreover, ScapesMania intends to motivate community members through its staking program. By locking in a specified quantity of MANIA tokens, holders can receive additional tokens as a reward for their dedication. Here\u2019s a quick snapshot: Among the total of 4 billion MANIA tokens, a substantial 320 million, or 8%, are earmarked for community rewards. Source: ScapesMania\u2019s Whitepaper Through DAO governance, ScapesMania participants will have the authority to vote on pivotal decisions concerning ecosystem development. ScapesMania is continuously improving the utility of the $MANAI token by adding new features and incorporating it into more gaming projects. Additionally, the ScapesMania team has shown skill in reaching a wider audience, as seen in the success of the $6M+ presale. With greater visibility and support from cryptocurrency influencers, the user base expands, consequently driving up demand for MANIA, which ultimately benefits both the project and the community in the long term. At last, the project\u2019s smart contract has been subjected to a thorough audit by BlockSafu. As a holder, you can rest assured that the platform places a high priority on security, safeguarding both your data and funds. P.S.

Community Confidence Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are keen to get involved, attracted by its vision and the chance to play a meaningful role. Even whales are taking notice, as deposits have already surpassed $20,000. The accomplishment achieved owes much to the committed community backing it. The ScapesMania team extends sincere gratitude to its supporters for this initial momentum. Looking Ahead: Future Opportunities Predictions from Statista indicate that this sector is poised to exceed $19.12 billion by 2027, Having met its presale goals, the team is now fully committed to product development. This phase necessitates both skill and resources, and ScapesMania is actively recruiting top talent by collaborating with seasoned game development studios and assembling an in-house team. Not long ago, the CEO of ScapesMania detailed the team\u2019s development strategy.

Fetch.ai Saved \u2013 Whales for the Win The crypto market correction is weighing heavily on all the digital assets, but Fetch.ai\u2019s price somehow did not fall as much. FET only noted a 2% correction throughout the day. However, that does not cover up for the fact that the altcoin could have dropped by over 15%. All thanks to the whales for not letting this happen. The intra-day lows of $2.37 were nearly locked in as trading price before the whales stepped in. The large wallet holders accumulated FET heavily, resulting in the price bouncing back.

FET Price Prediction: Bearish Momentum Is yet to Build Fetch.ai\u2019s price nearly slipped to $2.37 but bounced back to the trading price of $2.80. This establishes the precedent that the bullish steam has not been completely exhausted. The altcoin is still above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, which is also a positive signal, making FET safe from falling below the $2.46 support floor.

Convicted in November for orchestrating what prosecutors have termed one of the \u201cbiggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s downfall is a tale of ambition gone awry, set against the backdrop of the cryptocurrency boom. Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Up to 50 Years in Prison The crux of the prosecution\u2019s argument hinges on Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fraudulent activities, which led to the spectacular collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The jury in a Manhattan federal court found him guilty on all charges, including defrauding investors, customers, and lenders. Thereby, unsettling the once booming crypto market. Prosecutors have painted a damning portrait of Bankman-Fried, describing his recent life as marred by \u201cunmatched greed and hubris.\u201d They argue that his actions were risky and a deliberate ploy to gamble with billions of dollars of other people. Despite the gravity of his actions, Sam Bankman-Fried has refrained from admitting wrongdoing. This is a stance that has only compounded the case against him. \u201cEven now, Bankman-Fried refuses to admit what he did was wrong. His life in recent years has been one of unmatched greed and hubris; of ambition and rationalization; and courting risk and gambling repeatedly with other people\u2019s money,\u201d prosecutors wrote. In contrast, Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense argues for leniency, suggesting a prison term of just over five to six years. They contend that most FTX clients will recover their lost funds and that Bankman-Fried did not intentionally set out to commit fraud. This defense, however, seems to falter against the weight of evidence presented during the trial. These include testimony from several of Bankman-Fried\u2019s closest associates who have since turned state\u2019s witnesses.

Still, invaluable insights can be learned into what VCs look for in crypto startups. These include outlining a blueprint for entrepreneurs to refine their approach, focusing on timing, clarity, market understanding, team composition, and community engagement. Building the Perfect Pitch Danilo Carlucci, Founder and CEO of Morningstar Ventures, told BeInCrypto that timing is critical. Startups should engage VCs only when they have a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates their product\u2019s or service\u2019s feasibility and potential. This stage is crucial for eliciting initial interest and feedback from investors. Then, utilizing this feedback to refine the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allows startups to showcase tangible achievements and metrics, making a stronger case for investment. According to Carlucci, proper timing and iteration of these stages, evidenced by quantifiable success metrics, significantly impact the project\u2019s Future Diluted Valuation (FDV). \u201cTiming is such a difficult thing to get perfect. But if start-ups time their project stages correctly and iterate them, they can raise more funds, ultimately impacting their FDV,\u201d Carlucci said. He also emphasized the importance of clarity and conciseness in pitches. A successful pitch concisely articulates the problem being solved, the uniqueness of the solution, and the strategic use of capital. More importantly, clear go-to-market strategies and user acquisition plans are particularly compelling.

Source: The TIE Projects that distinguish themselves through a well-defined unique selling proposition (USP), backed by thorough market and competitor analysis, stand out. Incorporating on-chain metrics and market trends can further enhance a project\u2019s attractiveness by providing a clear picture of its potential. \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard it before. Less is more. As simple as it sounds, we value clear and concise pitches. Keep it short and sweet! Not only do VCs read through hundreds of pitches a week, but I firmly believe that the less time it takes to explain your project, the better it will be,\u201d Carlucci advice. Likewise, Samuel Huber, the CEO of Landvault and the Matera Protocol, told BeInCrypto that startups should pivot their focus toward hard metrics. These include profitability, burn rate, and capital efficiency, which are now paramount to investors. Even with the current enthusiasm in the crypto market, the broader economy will likely continue to adopt a cautious approach. The emphasis on real revenue generation cannot be overstated. In the flux of market cycles, where bull markets often prioritize growth at the expense of solid business foundations, bear markets shift the focus back to fundamental metrics like revenue. \u201cEntrepreneurs should shift their focus towards metrics that investors prioritize. Indeed, crypto startups need to demonstrate their ability to generate real revenue. They must focus on showcasing practical business models rather than solely emphasizing decentralization,\u201d Huber explained. The path to funding is fraught with challenges. \u201cThere\u2019s a tightening of funds for startups with unproven business models and poor execution,\u201d Huber noted. He emphasized the importance of demonstrating tangible business metrics over mere projections. This calls for a meticulous focus on building a solid business that stands out in a bear market. Tokenomics and the Dream Team Moreover, the team behind a project is a critical factor for VCs. Carlucci emphasized that VCs invest in people as much as in ideas. Therefore, a team\u2019s track record, complementarity, and vision are scrutinized. The team\u2019s openness to collaboration and feedback and a proactive approach significantly influence a VC\u2019s investment decision. In this regard, most VCs look for teams with a strong track record and extensive experience in their field. \u201cThe team is everything! No matter the tech, the design, or the idea, most VCs invest in people; therefore, the team and the vision of the founder is crucial,\u201d Carlucci said. Tokenomics and crypto narrative trends play a crucial role in attracting investment. Projects must design tokenomics that align VCs\u2019 interests with the project\u2019s long-term vision, ensuring a vested interest in the project\u2019s success. Likewise, entrepreneurs must align their projects with prevailing crypto narratives, striving to position themselves as leaders within these spaces. Despite the inherent risks in the crypto industry, Carlucci suggested that a well-articulated USP and comprehensive market analysis can address potential concerns and demonstrate the startup\u2019s awareness of and preparedness for challenges. Meanwhile, Huber highlighted the importance of utility and adaptability. \u201cGenerally, projects within infrastructure sectors are highly attractive to investors due to their potential for broader utility. While applications certainly create value, infrastructure projects influenced by narrative trends such as NFTs, the metaverse, DeFi, RWA, or the creator economy offer a foundation that can be leveraged by others, thereby enhancing their resilience,\u201d Huber added. Total Capital Raised by Sector. Source: The TIE Trust is also a critical factor in investment decisions. VCs prefer to back founders they know and trust, reflecting the importance of building a strong company and networking to enhance credibility. In Huber\u2019s view, the journey to securing VC funding in the crypto market is as much about showcasing resilience and innovation as it is about navigating the nuances of investor expectations and market dynamics. Indeed, Carlucci highlighted the importance of selecting the right VC partners. Startups should seek strategic partners offering more than capital, such as user access, networking opportunities, and industry expertise.
