This annual observance, established in 1987, emphasizes the profound contributions women have made to society. Diversity Drives Web3 Growth Monica Talán, Founder and Contributor at Spanish-language web3 platform CryptoConexión, told Cryptonews that raising awareness for women in web3 is not just about achieving gender balance. Rather, Talán believes that highlighting women in the web3 sector will expand the field\u2019s talent pool, leading to fresh perspectives and new approaches. \u201cThis will create more equitable economic opportunities, build inclusive communities, and ensure that the future of technology reflects and serves the needs of all,\u201d said Talán. This is critical, as 2023 data suggests that women hold about 26% of all jobs in the crypto industry. Statistics further show that only about 6% of the top leadership roles are held by women, with 94% of CEOs being male. According to Talán, women make up 47% of CryptoConexión\u2019s audience. She explained that by shifting the perspective from \u201cbelieving women must adapt to web3\u201d to \u201cunderstanding that web3 must evolve to embrace women\u201d has helped with the platform\u2019s diversity. Talán explained that CryptoConexión spotlighted 60 Latinas contributing to the web3 sector at the start of Women\u2019s History Month this year. \u201cThis list also included newcomers,\u201d said Talán. \u201cThis effort highlights the importance of representation, aiming to inspire more Latinas to join web3 and create a more inclusive, diverse digital future.\u201d Sandy Carter, COO at web3 domain platform Unstoppable Domains, told Cryptonews that women in the crypto sector have indeed innovated in unique ways. Carter shared that Unstoppable hosted a space on the X platform focused on \u201cthe power of tokenization and women\u201d on March 8 \u2013 International Women\u2019s Day. \u201cWe had guests like Dr Anino Emuwa, who founded 100 Women Davos, and The Africa Women CEO Network,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also had the Director from Boss Beauties who worked on the Mattel Barbie and Boss Beauty NFT project.\u201d Honored to be part of @UnstoppableWow3's initiative to empower women in #Web3 and #AI this International Women's Day.

Kim Currier, Head of Marketing at the Decentraland Foundation, told Cryptonews that from March 26-29, Decentraland will showcase the art of talented women during its second annual \u201cArt Week\u201d and \u201cMESHfair.\u201d \u201cMESHfair is a unique opportunity for artists to explore their creativity in a virtual environment,\u201d said Currier. Currier added that women artists will represent 16 of the 32 international artists selected to show new works during MESHfair. Image of MeshFAIR 2023. Source: MeshFAIR Artist and web3 producer Bay Backner founded MESHfair. Backner told Cryptonews that MESHfair acts as a way to connect artists working in the 3D file format for virtual reality (VR) with galleries and collectors. \u201cDespite widespread interest in VR, works in this format are still underrepresented in both traditional art fairs and influential NFT collections,\u201d said Backner. Backner added that 13.7% of living artists represented by galleries in Europe and North America are women. \u201cOf the 100 most expensive works ever sold, none have been made by a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there is still a long way to go towards gender equality in-real life art.\u201d Unfortunately, Backner believes that a similar gender gap is opening within the VR sector. This may be due to a lack of women-led Metaverse companies. According to McKinsey, only 10% of the virtual world or metaverse companies that gained funding during the 2017-2022 crypto boom were led by women. \u201cSo unless we work on discoverability here \u2013 sharing the work of women entrepreneurs and creatives in VR \u2013 we\u2019ll see the same tired old narratives being repeated,\u201d remarked Backner. With this in mind, Backner explained that MESHfair is important for discoverability. \u201cIt supports the small, but growing community of creators in immersive web3 technology. And every artist in this space right now is making history,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re defining a new artistic medium. It\u2019s therefore especially important that women artists are a documented and discoverable part of this conversation.\u201d A female artist by the name of \u201cJaneDAO\u201d told Cryptonews that displaying her work during MESHfair and Women\u2019s History Month provides a platform to inspire through sharing and creating. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to highlight the diverse creativity and insights women bring to these fields, reinforcing that art communicates universally powerful messages,\u201d she said. \u201cMy involvement not only showcases my contributions but also shines a light on the broader impact of women in this space, sparking important conversations about our shaping role in the future of tech and art.\u201d Image created by JaneDAO. Source: MeshFAIR Women in Web3 Continue to be Highlighted Even as Women\u2019s History Month comes to an end, women-focused initiatives will continue in hopes of encouraging women\u2019s participation in web3. Talán recognizes that the blockchain sector often presents a hurdle for women. She suggests focusing on simplifying web3 concepts and platforms, thus making the sector more approachable, as a key factor in changing the current dynamic. \u201cThe technical jargon, lack of easy-to-use platforms, and fast pace can be intimidating, especially in a field historically dominated by men,\u201d said Talán. \u201cDespite these challenges, significant progress is being made through dedicated ongoing efforts to onboard women into web3.\u201d For example, Talán explained that initiatives like SheFi, Unstoppable Women of web3, HER DAO, Black Women Blockchain Council, and the Association for Women in Crypto are key in demystifying the space. Each of these platforms offers continued education, resources, and community support. \u201cIn Latin America, \u2018WAGMI LATAM\u2019s\u2019 collaboration with communities like Cripto Curiosas, WomenBiz, WEDAO LATAM, WARMI, Mujeres en Crypto and Metagals have shown us the importance of creating local and regional inclusive environments,\u201d added Talán. Backner further noted that she will be hosting upcoming projects geared toward women this year. \u201cMy two upcoming projects are Decentraland Gaming Week (June 2024) which will support diverse creators to build interactive web3 games, and The Censored Art Show (Sept 2024) which will support digital artists impacted by censorship or shadowbanning on social media and other platforms,\u201d she said. Backner pointed out that censorship in particular is an issue that disproportionately affects women and minority digital artists. \u201cThis is especially the case if artists use their own bodies within their works,\u201d she said. Additionally, Carter shared that Unstoppable will continue its commitment to increasing women\u2019s involvement in web3 and tech in general. \u201cWe plan to expand our educational initiatives, offering more workshops, courses, and mentorship programs tailored for women,\u201d she said. \u201cNetworking events and safe spaces for discussions will continue to be a priority, ensuring women feel supported and connected.\u201d The post Web3 Community Celebrates Women\u2019s History Month in The Metaverse and Beyond appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_summary":"March has seen several web3 initiatives to recognize and spotlight women\u2019s achievements in celebration of Women\u2019s History Month.

This change in operation became effective on March 15 under Binance\u2019s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, Richard Teng, who assumed the role four months ago. Binance Labs Severs Ties, Maintains Branding A disclaimer announcing the split was published on the website saying, \u201cBinance Labs is an independent venture and not part of the Binance Group nor is it involved in any of the businesses operated by the Binance Group (including but not limited to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange).\u201d Following the effect of this change in operation, personnel at Binance Labs now operate under separate employment agreements from Binance exchange staff. This is in line with the arrangements that are effective at the Binance-backed blockchain network, BNB Chain. In an unexpected move, #Binance has spun off its venture capital arm, Binance Labs, into an independent entity valued at $10 billion. This strategic decision aims to enhance operational efficiency and growth under the leadership of CEO Richard Teng. Despite the separation,\u2026 \u2014 Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) March 15, 2024 Investment Director at Binance Labs, Alex Odagiu noted that they are no longer affiliated with the Binance group as well. He said this while clarifying that the venture capital entity would continue to use the Binance brand under a licensing agreement. Binance Labs has invested in over 250 projects since it launched. There are many companies in its portfolio that have been impacted by this transition into an independent firm. Some are industry giants like PancakeSwap, Polygon, Sky Mavis, and Curve DAO. Aptos Labs, LayerZero, and The Sandbox are some of the other companies involved. In February, Binance Labs invested in Babylon, a Bitcoin staking protocol that introduced the concept of native Bitcoin staking. The investment enables users to stake their Bitcoins on Proof-of-Stake blockchains and earn yields without relying on third-party custody. This bridges services, or token wrapping mechanisms. The unfolding events at Binance have been on the crypto community\u2019s radar since a November settlement with US authorities. The authorities charged Binance $4.3 billion and demanded that founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao step down. Despite its newfound independence, Binance Labs\u2019 core operations are expected to stay unaffected, with an emphasis on finding and investing in promising crypto projects. Venture Capital Trend Among Crypto Exchanges In 2018, Yi He, who heads Binance Labs and co-founded Binance alongside Zhao launched the venture capital division. As a venture capital and incubator, Binance Labs uses funds from the exchange\u2019s profits to back early-stage crypto projects. The splitting of these two entities does not appear to be a cause for major concern within the Binance ecosystem. Binance still holds the largest market share of centralized exchanges (CEXs), accounting for about 50% of global trading volume. The Binance native token, BNB, has experienced a slight decline since the news broke, however. At the time of reporting, BNB was trading at $584.31, representing a decrease of 2.81%. Aside from Binance, popular exchanges in the crypto industry, such as Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken have also established venture capital businesses. Coinbase Ventures was the second-most active investor in the crypto sector in 2023, according to data from PitchBook. Odagiu admitted that in Binance Lab\u2019s case, the transition will not have much impact on the company.

A March 12 post on the official forum announced the launch of the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP), a project requesting 200 million ARB tokens for developer onboarding and gaming development. \nAccording to the post, the goal of the GCP is to develop a long-term gaming ecosystem on the Arbitrum network:\n\u201cWe are asking the DAO to earmark 200m ARB over a two year period to bolster the gaming ecosystem on Arbitrum and establish the network as the top choice for game builders across the landscape. The GCP is meant to serve as a catalyst, not a comprehensive program, with a focus around onboarding and supporting high quality builders. After the roll out of the GCP, the aim is to mature into a longer-term gaming program with a more comprehensive approach to game ecosystem growth.\u201d\nAs of the time of this article\u2019s publication, 200 million ARB is worth approximately $426 million. The funds would be partially used for coinvesting in promising studios and games for development on the platform, according to the forum post.\nThe project also shared its key productivity indicators and estimates, a list that includes establishing Arbitrum as \u201cthe de facto leader for on-chain gaming.\u201d\nOther goals include taking 200 to 300 applications for builders, having 20% or more of all Web3 games select Arbitrum as their base network, 25 new Orbit launches, and more net migrations to Arbitrum versus other layer-2 networks.\nThe proposal also says that, if approved, 40 million ARB would be allocated for infrastructure bounties. These would be paid out on a \u201cper proposal basis for any tooling and infrastructure needed to support gaming within Arbitrum.\u201d\nThe timing of the GCP launch and proposal comes just three days ahead of a scheduled ARB token unlock. As Cointelegraph recently reported, Arbitrum will unlock 673.5 million tokens (worth around $1.34 billion at current prices) for its team and advisers as part of a March 16 \u201ccliff unlock\u201d of about 1.1 billion tokens.\nRelated: CCP reveals game world details and playtest dates for new blockchain game set in Eve universe\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Nifty Newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest NFT headlines.

Decisions are made collaboratively in an environment where the power is distributed among members, not concentrated in a central authority. This concept, once confined to the realm of science fiction, is now taking shape in the form of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\nDAOs are internet-based organizations fueled by blockchain technology. They function through smart contracts, self-executing code that automates decision-making based on established rules. Ownership and voting rights are often linked to crypto tokens, empowering members to actively shape the DAO\u2019s trajectory. This structure upholds transparency as all transactions and decisions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, accessible for public scrutiny.\nThe challenges around DAOs\nBut as with any disruptive innovation, DAOs come with their own set of challenges, raising a critical question: can they truly revolutionize governance, or are they destined to remain a captivating experiment?\nOne of the most significant challenges facing DAOs is the potential for large tokenholders, known as whales, to influence voting outcomes in their favor. Due to their extensive holdings, whales can manipulate governance outcomes, undermining the collective decision-making process and jeopardizing the fairness and legitimacy of the DAO. According to a research paper, voting power in DAO governance systems is unfair and highly centralized, with fewer than 10 addresses having full control over most DAOs. The study shows that for crypto platforms Compound, Fei and Uniswap, the community delegate vote share is low at about 10% or less.\nAdvertisement\nTrade smart with Markets Pro instant alerts. Claim your 65% discount now!\nAd\nThe centralization issue in the voting process is further exacerbated by Sybil attacks, where individuals impersonate multiple voters to skew outcomes using the ease of creating multiple accounts. These attacks can erode trust and hinder the legitimacy of a DAO\u2019s governance.\nWhile some participants in DAOs may be aligned with collective interests and long-term goals, investors will inevitably be driven solely by quick profits, disregarding a project\u2019s sustainability and future. The intrinsic importance of tradeable governance tokens in DAO operations makes aligning financial incentives and community interests challenging, particularly in optimizing a project\u2019s growth potential over time.\nRecognition of diverse contributions\nSecure identity verification measures and a transparent governance system can solve the problems within DAOs. AirDAO, a community-governed layer-1 blockchain, recognizes the solution and aims to make decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible, fair and user-friendly for everyone.\nBuilt on its own blockchain network -AMB-NET- AirDAO offers a product suite to simplify complex financial operations. The suite includes cross-chain bridging to Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain along with a staking platform, a multichain network explorer and FirepotSwap \u2014 a native decentralized exchange (DEX) developed in partnership with Firepot Finance.\nUnderstanding the challenges of governance manipulation and multiple account creation, AirDAO implemented solutions to foster a fairer and more inclusive decision-making process:\nFacial verification: Through a partnership with Fractal ID, a provider of Web3 identity solutions, AirDAO links wallets to users using facial verification technology. The integration enables the creation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that verify identities without requiring the disclosure of personal information or compromising user anonymity. Facial verification reduces the ability to create multiple accounts, ensures each vote is from a unique participant and promotes transparency and accountability.\nThe issuance of the AirDAO\u2019s governance soulbound token (SBT), AMB, is also based on the user\u2019s facial recognition biometric data verified by Fractal ID.\nImpact-based governance: AirDAO\u2019s system rewards users with soulbound tokens (SBTs) based on their contributions to the platform, such as providing liquidity or participating in governance discussions. SBTs determine an individual\u2019s voting power, giving a stronger voice to those who actively contribute to the project\u2019s success.\nAirDAO rewards the community for contributing to its ecosystem with impact-based SBTs. Source: AirDAO\nAirDAO recognizes that its success relies on the contributions of a diverse community. Whether users validate transactions, contribute their skills or champion AirDAO as a Governor or Ambassador, their efforts will be crowned with governance SBTs that reflect users\u2019 benefits to the ecosystem.\nA vision for decentralization\nAirDAO\u2019s Governance Working Group (GWG), comprised of around 30 community members with expertise in various fields, underlines the platform\u2019s commitment to community governance.\nAirDAO\u2019s vision is to complete decentralization and become a fully community-governed project that fosters collective decision-making within the DeFi space. If successful, AirDAO\u2019s potential to address key challenges in DAO governance could pave the way for a more equitable and trustworthy future for DAOs and the wider DeFi ecosystem.\nLearn more about AirDAO Governance Platform\nJoin support Telegram group for AirDAO governors\n#Blockchain\n#Security\n#Decentralization\n#Identity\n#DAO\n#DeFi\nDisclaimer.

As a result, Tornado Cash has been subject to significant legal actions, including its addition to the United States sanctions lists, effectively banning residents in the country from using the service and sparking controversy within the cryptocurrency community.\nProposal open for vote\nSupporters of Tornado Cash argue that the platform merely provides software for decentralized money transmission and does not directly engage in money transmission itself, which challenges the basis of the charges against its developers. According to the crypto advocacy group Coin Center, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidelines state that an anonymizing software provider should not be considered a money transmitter.\nStorm and Pertsev face several charges from U.S. authorities, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business.\nThe first two charges can each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the charge for operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business is punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\u201cThese [legal] challenges not only threaten the developers\u2019 ability to continue their work but also undermine the fundamental principles of decentralization and individual freedom upon which projects with privacy-preserving technologies are built.\u201d\nThe community proposal comes just a few days after the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe canceled a fundraiser dedicated to collecting legal fees for Storm and Pertsev, citing a breach of their terms of service that could \u201cexpose GoFundMe, its employees or Users to any harm or liability of any type.\u201d\nMagazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 \u2014 The race to build safe and legal coin mixers","article_summary":"The Arbitrum community is voting on a proposal to fund a \u201crobust legal defense\u201d for Tornado Cash developers Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev.","converted_creation_date":"Fri Mar 08 07:00:00 ICT 2024","_id":{"date":"Sat Mar 16 13:21:45 ICT 2024","timestamp":1710570105},"creation_date":"2024-03-08","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#United States","#Regulation","#Tornado Cash"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-dao-vote-1-million-fund-tornado-cash-devs-legal-defense","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"UAE\u2019s RAK DAO and Tencent Cloud ink deal to boost crypto startups","article_type":"Article","author":{"name":"Ezra Reguerra","last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/trader-fumbles-1-million-solana-memecoin-frenzy"},"article_detailed_content":"Tencent Cloud, the cloud services arm of the Chinese conglomerate Tencent, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the United Arab Emirates\u2019 crypto-focused free economic zone to facilitate startup growth through several initiatives.\nOn March 7, the Ras Al Khaimah Digital Asset Oasis (RAK DAO) announced the signing of an MoU with Tencent Cloud to explore \u201cavenues for mutual growth.\u201d Initially, the deal includes facilitating the growth of startups registered at the RAK DAO, a dedicated crypto zone located in Ras Al Khaimah, one of the UAE\u2019s seven emirates.\nTencent Cloud executives sit with Sheikh Saud at the signing ceremony.

Bitpac stands for a Bitcoin Based Publicly Auditable Cooperative. Bitpacs are essentially normal bitcoin multisig wallets with the additional introduction of public auditability. Traditionally in a multisig setup, participants of the multisig are not disclosed. In a Bitpac multisig, participants are intentionally made public, which allows for transparent auditability. With this transparency, unique features, tooling, rules, and transaction crafting is possible. The goal of Bitpacs is to emulate the familiar DAO experience on other chains. DAO\u2019s are marketed as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. However, Ethereum and other altcoin based DAOs only inherit the \u201cdecentralization\u201d of their chain, so will not be as decentralized as the same experience built on Bitcoin. DAO\u2019s are also not autonomous, as humans control and shape the decisions they make. The Bitpac definition is a more honest explanation of the tech involved and I think eventually will be a better experience for users. Why should bitcoiners even care about DAO\u2019s? As of Feb 18th 2024, DAO\u2019s on Ethereum hold over $35 billion in treasury funds. There have been millions of DAO proposal makers and voters, and hundreds of millions of dollars have been transacted via DAO governance. (source) There is clear demand for on-chain governance and community management, Bitpacs allow this to come to Bitcoin. How can Bitpacs actually work? While Bitpacs don't directly utilize smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, they achieve similar functionality as DAOs through a combination of multisig wallets and carefully crafted Bitcoin transactions. The structures possible with this encompass most of what a DAO does: Multisig ensures that no one is ever in unilateral control of any Bitpac funds, requiring the quorum threshold to spend anything. Signing thresholds that mandate how many signatures are needed to finalize a transaction (3 of 5 or 6 of 10 for example) can fine tune required voting thresholds in line with the defined Bitpac consensus requirements. Time constraints can be applied to voting rounds, ending the signing process for proposals that haven\u2019t achieved a signing threshold by the end of a voting period. Gating membership of Bitpacs based on certain criteria can be done at the platform level, like unique assets held, bitcoin contributed to the treasury, or known wallet addresses, all of which can be verified on-chain. All of these dynamics that cannot be enforced through Bitcoin script or pre-signed transactions, and must resort to social enforcement, are transparently verifiable on-chain guaranteeing detection of Bitpac rule violations. What do Bitpacs enable on Bitcoin? Bitpacs unlock exciting possibilities for bitcoin users: Community-driven funding: Fundraising for public goods, projects, or charitable causes becomes more efficient and secure with Bitpacs. Contributors can trust that funds are used as intended, thanks to the transparent nature of the multisig. Decentralized governance: Bitpacs empower communities to make collective decisions regarding fund allocation and spending. Voting rights are distributed among key holders, ensuring a transparent and verifiable process. Increased trust and collaboration: By eliminating the opacity often associated with traditional financial systems, Bitpacs build trust and foster collaboration between individuals with shared interests, and doing so fully on-chain. Some specific examples of Bitpac use cases include: Funding open-source development: Developers can create Bitpacs to receive community funding for their projects, with transparent spending records ensuring accountability to their backers. Managing community treasuries: Any organization can leverage Bitpacs for transparent management of their funds, allowing members to track spending, create proposals, and participate in decision-making. Crowdfunding: Bitpacs can be used as a means to crowdfund bitcoin from a group of supporters for a pre-established shared goal, company, investment fund, or project. A major lesson for the industry over the last year has been how much innovation and experimentation can still be done on native Bitcoin without requiring any changes to the network. We have seen massive interest around BitVM, Ordinals, roll-ups, sidechains, layers, metaprotocols, all within bitcoins current consensus. There is clearly a cambrian explosion of developer and user interest coming to Bitcoin which will not slow down any time soon. Tens of thousands of new niche communities will be popping up on Bitcoin in the coming years. This doesn\u2019t include traditional companies that continue to trend towards Bitcoin adoption over time. Bitpacs can agnostically offer community organization, treasury management, and on-chain governance to all of them. The thousands of ideas being \u201cbuilt on Bitcoin\u201d should have one thing in common, eventual settlement on the base layer. Different methods of governance will be experimented with over time, but this is why Bitpacs could be the superior model. Bitpac members have direct voting access to the treasury and transactions occur at the base layer; there is no side-chain, layer, or additional protocol that Bitpac members need to trust. Potentially this cycle, people will start to realize that Bitcoin block space is just as scarce as bitcoin the asset. As we trend further towards a hyperbitcoinized world, with nation states and institutions transacting, I think that Bitpacs representing large community or entity treasuries will be one of the few things that will justify occurring at the Base layer. \u2013 Anybody can create Bitpacs on their own. @Tribe_btc is a centralized project I\u2019m working on aiming to create a full tooling suite for Bitpacs. Tribe will be releasing our Bitpac documentation soon.

Since January 2022, Solana has seen around half a dozen significant outages and 15 partial or major outage days.\nEngineers from across the ecosystem are investigating an outage on mainnet-beta. This thread will be updated as more information becomes available https://t.co/rfeioQ6BG9\n\u2014 Solana Status (@SolanaStatus) February 6, 2024\nThe incidents varied in severity, ranging from partial to total network outages, and their causes included software vulnerabilities in the network and denial-of-service and resource exhaustion attacks.\nThe most recent outage was blamed on a bug that resulted in an infinite loop error, which caused the validators to stall on a particular block. An infinite loop error causes a program to get stuck in an endless cycle, which, in the case of Solana, prevented validators from verifying transactions on the network as they were stuck trying to process the same block.\nPost-mortem\nAnza, a Solana-focused software development firm, released a postmortem report of the recent outage on Feb. 9 detailing its cause and how validators restarted the network. The report revealed that Solana\u2019s Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation cache, which compiles all programs before executing a transaction, encountered the bug.\nEarlier, the JIT cache was implemented using \u201cExecutorsCache,\u201d however, with the v1.16 release, ExecutorsCache was replaced by a new implementation called \u201cLoadedPrograms.\u201d The new loader program used accounting information stored in a program\u2019s on-chain account to look up its most recent deployment slot and use this to calculate the effective slot height.\nHowever, this loader program encountered a legacy loader issue resulting in the JIT cache encountering a loop with older programs, causing it to recompile them repeatedly instead of efficiently accessing and executing their instructions. This glitch resulted in a network stall, as the system became bogged down in an infinite loop, unable to process transactions or move forward.\nAustin Federa, head of strategy at the Solana Foundation, told Cointelegraph that there was a process to replace the old loader system with a new motor system, but it was scheduled to be disabled with an updated version.\n\u201cIt looks like someone intentionally called that old instruction set, which hadn\u2019t been used in quite a long time but was still around in the codebase. The JIT compiler ran into issues where it couldn\u2019t find what it was looking for. And that\u2019s what created the infinite loop,\u201d\nSolana engineers quickly discovered and fixed the problem, updated the system\u2019s processes, and identified these older programs to prevent future recompilation cycles. This solution entailed reducing the deployment of troublesome legacy loaders to ensure that all program instructions could be accessed accurately and effectively without falling into the recompilation trap.\nRecent: ZK-proofs introduce security challenges for developers\nSome critics have said that a significant factor contributing to Solana\u2019s outages is the lack of client diversity, leading to potential central points of failure. Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer of open source decentralized exchange platform Komodo, told Cointelegraph that Solana\u2019s developers and validators prioritize shipping code fast over maintaining perfect network uptime, adding:\n\u201cThe key reason is centralization and lack of validator client options. Solana\u2019s ambition for high throughput and low transaction times puts immense pressure on its infrastructure, making it susceptible to performance degradation and outages.\u201d\nHowever, Federa suggests Solana possesses much more accurate architecture and explains that only two smart contract networks worldwide have independent validator clients: Ethereum and Solana. Currently, Solana has one major validator client built on one functional codebase.\n\u201cSolana has never had an outage due to a fault in consensus or something along those lines. The problems have always been implementation details. It\u2019s always been that there\u2019s been a bug somewhere in the implementation layer, which is not better or worse. It\u2019s just an important kind of accuracy,\u201d Austin explained.\nThe Solana mainnet \u201cbeta\u201d saga\nThe Solana blockchain was launched in March 2020, and over the next four years, the network has made significant strides in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Solana ranks as the fifth-largest DeFi chain in total value locked, with over $1.7 billion in capital allocated to different on-chain protocols. Its native Solana (SOL) token has a market valuation of around $49 billion, making it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency.\nDespite a magnificent track record, Solana has never officially come out of its beta phase. The blockchain is still referred to as being in mainnet beta. Beta is a term that refers to nearly finished software that a select group of users is testing before an official launch.\nHowever, the Solana blockchain is open to everyone, with hundreds of decentralized applications utilized to launch various products. The blockchain ecosystem also boasts a vibrant nonfungible token (NFT) ecosystem.\nSolana underwent brief private and public beta testing before releasing v1.0 four years ago, and today, the network processes more transactions than most other chains.\nEven though the code is still changing, Solana is much beyond what can be considered beta software. The persistent misperception results from a mix-up between pre-launch testing and post-launch software maturity and misconceptions around Solana\u2019s messaging.\nRecent: How can crypto firms bridge the gap with traditional finance?\nThe beta status has attracted much criticism of the blockchain, especially in light of its outages over the past two years. Crypto users on social media have often mocked that Solana\u2019s status as a mainstream blockchain often changes to mainnet beta and back, depending on whether the chain is down.\nSolana is a joke. Period.\n\nHow many halts have there been in lasts months? The \u201cit\u2019s a beta\u201d is not an excuse anymore. $SOL #Solana pic.twitter.com/IjvRaM58dZ\n\u2014 David Miller ⬡ (@CryptoDavid_) May 1, 2022\nFedera claimed that most blockchain systems are in beta today and that only Bitcoin and Ethereum are probably complete mainnets and explained:\n\u201cIt takes a long time for software systems to stabilize and be feature-complete as important new features are still being shipped on the Solana network. I think we\u2019re probably nearing the end of that beta phase. From a technology standpoint, one of the significant milestones for that will be the launch of a second independent validator client.\u201d\nMany DeFi proponents believe that Solana\u2019s downtime is a definite roadblock to its aim of becoming an Ethereum competitor. Still, the developers have worked to ensure the bugs leading to past downtimes don\u2019t impact the network in the future. Despite its tainted history of downtime, its high speed and low cost play a key role in attracting new projects to the platform.","article_summary":"Solana\u2019s latest outage was its first in nearly a year and around half a dozen in the past two years, but despite that, the blockchain is thriving with network activity and a token price surge.","converted_creation_date":"Tue Feb 27 07:00:00 ICT 2024","_id":{"date":"Sat Mar 16 13:21:52 ICT 2024","timestamp":1710570112},"creation_date":"2024-02-27","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Technology","#Investments","#Tokens","#DeFi","#Solana"],"category":"FOLLOW UP","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-outage-client-diversity-beta","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Vitalik Buterin has an open-source solution to Elon Musk\u2019s Microsoft OS issues","article_type":"Article","author":{"name":"Prashant Jha","last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/de-fi-tvl-breaches-100-b-maker-dao-dai-endgame-finance-redefined"},"article_detailed_content":"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin believes the open-source operating system (OS) Linux is a perfect solution for Elon Musk\u2019s Microsoft Windows OS issues.

By taking advantage of Web3 and artificial intelligence (AI), Day By Day aims to deliver the way to more inclusive and democratized insurance.\nDespite its long history of providing financial security, the traditional insurance sector grapples with efficiency, transparency and security problems. As identified in the Aon report, the industry struggles to adapt to changing consumer behaviors, and challenges like demographic shifts and rising healthcare costs remain. Regulatory burdens are another issue, as highlighted by 80% of insurance CEOs believing over-regulation threatens growth.\nBlockchain stands as a beacon of hope in response to the inherent challenges of the insurance industry. Unlike traditional methods that rely on cumbersome paperwork and subjective assessments, blockchain promises to redefine the landscape of insurance through transparency, efficiency, security and accessibility.\nBuilding on the foundation laid by blockchain, the integration of real-world assets (RWAs) and AI further amplifies the potential for transformative change, enabling more nuanced risk assessments and personalized insurance products. Projects that leverage these technologies have a chance at overcoming historical challenges that have long plagued the insurance industry.\nThe monetization of insured assets\nDay By Day, a multichain Web3 insurance platform powered by AI, wants to revolutionize the insurance sector by combining the power of blockchain, RWAs and AI. The platform's users can secure their assets with an asset register app available on Google Play and the App Store.\nUpon creating an account, users can document their assets via photographs within the platform's proof-of-ownership consensus model. Users receive the platform's native digital asset, the DBD token, as a reward for every asset they register. The platform encourages holding DBD tokens with additional rewards and introduces the opportunity to purchase gift cards directly through the asset register app.\nDay By Day transforms nonfungible tokens (NFTs) into tangible insurance policy instruments. With this approach, individuals can hold NFTs as a means of securing insurance coverage and as an investment. Owners of policy NFTs with matching features also receive a share of the premiums collected from customers. Day By Day enables users to burn DBD tokens, effectively reducing the total supply in exchange for discounted rates on NFT policies.\nAt the heart of Day By Day\u2019s structure is the Underwriting DeFi Pool model, which aims to act as a safeguard against unexpected events. The model allocates a significant portion of insurance premiums into accessible and locked liquidity pools. Pool contributors receive DBD-LP tokens, representing a stake that can be actively traded.\nThis approach ensures that half of the underwriting is always secured, protecting against smart contract vulnerabilities. Day By Day envisions the concept of underwriting as a chance, stating: \u201dImagine everyone having the opportunity to invest like \u2018Warren Buffett\u2019 does in underwriting.\u201d\nDay By Day simplifies insurance with its easy-to-use app. Source: Day By Day\nAfter an extensive four-and-a-half-year development period, Day By Day has achieved several milestones, including the launch of its DBD token, the launch of its mobile app to register real-world assets, NFTs as insurance policies for anyone to own, DeFi underwriting to cover claims and the introduction of native staking on the Polygon and Algorand networks. Day By Day's goal is to expand its vision to include digital asset protection for health, life, travel and niche markets supported by Web3 and AI.\nDecentralized insurance control\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sell insurance,\u201d said Bill Angelidis, CEO and founder of Day By Day, while encapsulating the ethos of Day By Day, adding:\n\u201cPeople come to us to get protection for real-world assets that are valuable to them in a transparent, on-demand, personalized way like never before.\u201d\nSupporting the CEO\u2019s words, Day By Day is developing its Asset Protection Coverage feature. With this coverage system, customers will be able to choose the assets they want to protect, the events they want to preserve and the period they wish to cover.\nAdditionally, Day By Day plans to implement a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) project in the near future to democratize the insurance industry by giving all control authority to users.\nThe integration of cutting-edge technologies such as Web3 and AI, as showcased by innovative platforms like Day By Day, equips the insurance industry with tools to empower consumers and democratize access.
