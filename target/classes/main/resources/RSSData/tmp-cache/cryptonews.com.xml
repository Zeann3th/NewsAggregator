<p><span><a href="http://tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/">Solana</a> is trading at 180.72 increasing by nearly 4% on Friday.&nbsp;</span><span>The recent surge in Solana (SOL) prices can be attributed to the explosive rise of meme coin excitement, notably propelled by Dogewhatif (WIF). </span></p>
<p><span>WIF&#8217;s astonishing $700,000 fundraising success, far surpassing its $50,000 goal, spurred a 25% price surge and boasted a $3 billion market cap.</span></p>
<p><span>This fervor directly influenced SOL&#8217;s impressive 24% price hike.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><span>The surge in activity isn&#8217;t just about memes; it reflects the underlying strength of Solana&#8217;s network, evidenced by a <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">record total-value-locked (TVL)</a> of 23.07 million SOL, the highest since December 2022.</span>

<p><span>As Solana continues to distinguish itself with lightning-fast transactions and minimal fees, it becomes a hotbed for meme coin mania. </span><span>WIF&#8217;s connection to Solana&#8217;s robust infrastructure amplifies its appeal, potentially positioning it beyond meme status and into the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi). </span><span>While debates over its long-term viability persist, the surge in SOL prices underscores the growing influence of meme coins within the crypto-verse.</span></p>
<h2>Solana&#8217;s Value Soars with Bitcoin&#8217;s Rally and Growing Confidence in Its Ecosystem</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Solana&#8217;s (SOL) remarkable price surge resonates with the broader cryptocurrency market uplift, led by Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent to record highs above $72,000.</p>
<p>This bullish wave, further amplified by the approval of Bitcoin-centric ETFs and ETPs in major markets, has injected a fresh dose of optimism across the crypto sector.</p>
<p>The consequential spike in investment flow highlights a growing appetite among investors for digital assets.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin&#8217;s rally to new highs triggers a broader market optimism, benefitting SOL.</li>
<li>The SOL/BTC pair&#8217;s 32.45% climb signifies a growing investor shift towards Solana.</li>
<li>Solana gains momentum from meme coin activity, potentially enhancing its market value.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The evident shift towards Solana, driven by a quest for alternatives offering stability and innovation, marks a notable confidence boost in its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Coupled with the meme coin frenzy within Solana&#8217;s platform, these factors contribute to its increasing appeal and potential for further appreciation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>Jupiter&#8217;s Success on Solana Bolsters DeFi and Meme Coin Ecosystem</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
Jupiter, a prominent DeFi project within the Solana ecosystem, has showcased impressive performance by surpassing Uniswap V3 in data processing volume.</p>
<p>Experiencing a 67% increase since March 6, Jupiter&#8217;s resilience shines through, especially with the introduction of its Value-Average (Beta) feature.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; FXStreet Crypto (@FXScrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/FXScrypto/status/1768624621006303349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This feature&#8217;s success illustrates the platform&#8217;s robustness, even amid initial price volatility post-launch.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Jupiter surpasses Uniswap V3, showcasing Solana&#8217;s DeFi prowess.</li>
<li>Meme coin launches, like WEN, thrive on Solana&#8217;s LFG Launchpad, indicating rising market confidence.</li>
<li>Jupiter&#8217;s valuation hits $1.27 billion, underlining growing trust in Solana&#8217;s ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The surge in meme coins, including Bonk (BONK) and Dogwifhat (WIF), alongside Jupiter&#8217;s achievements, highlight the expanding allure of Solana&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>This expansion not only elevates Jupiter but also enhances Solana&#8217;s reputation as a burgeoning hub for DeFi and meme coin activities.</p>
<p>The escalating trust and investment in projects like Jupiter signal a bright future for Solana, potentially attracting more users and investors, thereby elevating SOL&#8217;s value in the cryptocurrency market.

<h2>Solana Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p>
As of this analysis, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana (SOL/USD)</a> is experiencing a slight retreat, trading at $181.57, down by 1.27%. The pivot point for SOL, represented by the green line, is placed at $181.57, which could act as a decisive level for future price movements.</p>
<p>The currency is currently at a critical juncture, brushing against immediate resistance levels at $188.69, $201.35, and $214.81, which may impede further upward progress.</p>

<p>The asset finds immediate support at $170.07, with deeper safety nets at $158.56 and $149.35, providing crucial zones to cushion any potential declines. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned at $157.42, offering a longer-term perspective on the asset&#8217;s momentum.</p>
<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 66.96, hovering near overbought territory, which could signal a possible consolidation or reversal if traders perceive SOL as overvalued at current levels. In conclusion, the overall trend for Solana suggests a moment of balance.

<p>On a day that crypto markets succumb to profit-taking, traders are turning to the on-chain shitcoin markets in order to hunt for top crypto gainers today that could deliver quick profits.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) was last trading in the $68,000s, down about 3.5% in the past 24 hours. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ether</a> (ETH), meanwhile, was last down about 4.2% over the same period and trading near $3,700.</p>
<p>Both cryptos continue to trade with 30-day gains of over 30%, thanks mostly to huge <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analyst-spot-bitcoin-etfs-anticipated-to-attract-220-billion-in-three-years.htm">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> demand.</p>
<p>But the ETF buyers were strong enough to hold up the market on Friday. More traders started taking profit in the latter half of the week thanks to the macro backdrop turning into a headwind.</p>
<p>The DXY and US yields have pushed up this week as macro traders downsized bets on Fed rate cuts in wake of the latest CPI and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/futures-rise-run-up-inflation-figures-retail-sales-data-2024-03-14/">PPI</a> inflation figures.</p>
<p>Some think that $74,000 may have been the pre-halving peak for Bitcoin. If the blue-chip markets are going to spend the next few weeks consolidating/falling, on-chain shitcoin markets all of a sudden become more attractive.</p>
<p>On-chain markets refer to the market for digital assets that have been issued directly on top an existing blockchain.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/shiba-inu-price-prediction/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> token is issued on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ethereum</a> as an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/best-erc20-wallets.htm">ERC-20</a> token.</p>
<p>These tokens can then be traded on decentralized exchanges, and also perhaps on centralized exchanges if they get big enough.</p>
<p>They are often referred to as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-shitcoins-buy/">shitcoin</a> markets because virtually anyone can issue a token at any time.</p>
<p>As a result, these on-chain markets are replete with scams and pump-and-dump schemes.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the top crypto gainers today on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> that traders will be monitoring.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXScreener</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3>MindAI ($MDAI)</h3>
<p>An AI shitcoin called MindAI ($MDAI) is up 6,753% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0xf67041c54a76a071d340dfa7390ae8ef17471f0a">DEXScreener</a>.</p>
<p>That makes it the top crypto gainer today on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Its market cap was last around $1.2 million, with just over $250,000 in locked liquidity.</p>
<p>Potential investors should be very cautious of this coin though, given five concerning aspects to its smart contract.</p>
<p>These include; a modifiable tax, pausable transfers, a 5% buy and sell tax and a whitelist function.</p>
<h3><strong>COCO ($COCO)</strong></h3>
<p>A shitcoin called Coco is up 1,800% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0xeae4c727ea43990ea92f427da36ddff8e72f6854">DEXScreener</a>, making it a top crypto gainer today.</p>
<p>Its market cap was last $3 million, with $274,000 in locked liquidity. It also has no smart contract issues.</p>
<p>But even if the token doesn’t look like a scam, shitcoins are all still very risky. The token is probably still a pump-and-dump scam.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as zero risk in the shitcoin market.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy.</p>
<p>An innocent-looking project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower.</p>
<p>A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">getting involved in crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price.</p>
<p>These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing.</p>
<p>While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales—unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision—savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more.</p>
<p>With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market.</p>
<p>Here are 14 of the presale projects with the highest potential.</p>

<p>On a day that crypto markets succumb to profit-taking, investors are hunting for the best crypto to buy in order to benefit from the recent market dip.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) was last trading in the $68,000s, down about 3.5% in the past 24 hours. <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">Ether</a> (ETH), meanwhile, was last down about 4.2% over the same period and trading near $3,700.</p>
<p>Both cryptos continue to trade with 30-day gains of over 30%, thanks mostly to huge <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analyst-spot-bitcoin-etfs-anticipated-to-attract-220-billion-in-three-years.htm">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> demand.</p>
<p>But the ETF buyers were strong enough to hold up the market on Friday. More traders started taking profit in the latter half of the week thanks to the macro backdrop turning into a headwind.</p>
<p>The DXY and US yields have pushed up this week as macro traders downsized bets on Fed rate cuts in wake of the latest CPI and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/futures-rise-run-up-inflation-figures-retail-sales-data-2024-03-14/">PPI</a> inflation figures.</p>
<p>Some think that $74,000 may have been the pre-halving peak for Bitcoin. That suggests it probably isn’t one of the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<p>But other <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoin-news/">altcoins</a> have continued to pump. Here are some top performers that traders will be watching and could be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Today</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Jupiter (JUP)</strong></h3>
<p>Jupiter (JUP), Solana’s biggest decentralized exchange, is pumping on Friday, having rallied 23.5% in 24 hours as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/jupiter-ag/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>The token just hit fresh record highs above $1.2, giving it a market cap of $1.6 billion. It’s fully diluted market cap is $12.17 billion.</p>
<p>That’s about $1 billion lower than Uniswap’s fully diluted market cap, the most well-established of the DEXs.</p>
<p>For reference, Uniswap’s circulating market cap was last around $7.8 billion. The cryptocurrency hit a market cap $22.6 billion in 2021, so could easily 3x from here.</p>
<p>Jupiter, as the Solana ecosystem leader, could see even larger gains.</p>
<p>That’s why it ranks as potentially the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Conflux (CFX)</strong></h3>
<p>Conflux (CFX) is one of the top performers today, up 18.5% in 24 hours as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/conflux-network/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>CFX has its sights set on challenging the early 2023 highs in the $0.49 area.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-184507" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/16000407/1710547447-screenshot-2024-03-15-185337.png" alt="Conflux could quick pump higher, meaning it could be the best crypto to buy today. " width="1776" height="713" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/16000407/1710547447-screenshot-2024-03-15-185337.png 1776w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/16000407/1710547447-screenshot-2024-03-15-185337-300x120.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/16000407/1710547447-screenshot-2024-03-15-185337-1024x411.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/16000407/1710547447-screenshot-2024-03-15-185337-768x308.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/16000407/1710547447-screenshot-2024-03-15-185337-1536x617.png 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/16000407/1710547447-screenshot-2024-03-15-185337-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1776px) 100vw, 1776px" /></p>
<p>If it can break above here, a quick surge towards late-2021 highs around $0.84 is on the cards.</p>
<p>The prospect of near-term 2x upside means CFX could easily be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Solana (SOL)</strong></h3>
<p>In fitting with the pump in the token of its largest DEX, Solana (SOL) is also up big on Friday.</p>
<p>SOL was last higher by about 7% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>Last above $180, SOL is bearing down on its 2021 highs $260 region.</p>
<p>Another 50% rally from current levels is easily possible for the token, ranking it as potentially the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make solid gains.</p>
<p>While the future is always uncertain in crypto, these names could be among the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<p>However, those looking for a better probability of near-term gains should consider an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy—getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>Presales offer investors a routine to get involved in a project at its very early stages, and thus potentially make returns of as much as 100x.</p>
<p>If investors can identify projects with solid foundation, the risk/reward of their investment is very good.</p>
<p>Analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time examining new presale projects.</p>
<p>Here are 14 of the best presales of 2024, according to the team at Cryptonews:</p>

The $5SCAPE token is currently priced at $0.00187 but will eventually list at a 434.76% price premium ($0.01) to this opening Stage 1 presale price. When Stage 1 finishes in two days&rsquo; time, the presale price rises by 14.97% to $0.00215 in Stage 2.&nbsp;</span><span>Eighty percent of the total token supply is available for purchase in the presale. The excitement around the project is shown by the size of the community on social media. 5thScape&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://discord.com/invite/5thscape"><span>Discord</span></a><span> server already has more than 5,400 members, </span><a href="https://t.me/fifthScape"><span>Telegram</span></a><span> 16,588, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/5th_scape"><span>X/Twitter</span></a><span> 9,569 and 1,000-plus on its </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@5thScape"><span>YouTube</span></a><span> channel</span></p>
<h2><span>Tokenization to play a major role in the future of VR</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>5thScape believes that tokenization will play a major role in the future of VR/AR, and its $5SCAPE token is central to its vision. Users will be able to stake $5SCAPE to earn rewards and unlock a wealth of utility-rich features.&nbsp;</span><span>A dynamic staking pool will be in part funded by player subscriptions and participation in virtual experiences. As more players are onboarded it grows the liquidity pool of the ecosystem to provide the basis for attractive and rewarding annual percentage yield from staking activities.</span><span>For gamers, </span><a href="https://5thscape.com/"><span>$5SCAPE</span></a><span> is the universal currency for unlocking products and services in a seamless transactional environment, such as buying and trading in-game assets and access to premium content.</span><span>On the other hand, for developers $5SCAPE tokens can be earned for building games for the platform and participation in the 5thScape Developer center.</span><span>The initial product offering includes an impressive array of games, from MMA Cage Contest to soccer VR sporting fun Immersive Kickoff, racing game Thrust Hunter and Archery Master, an adventure game where you follow in the footsteps of a legendary archer. Interested parties can join the waitlist for all the games today.</span></p>

</p>
<h2><span>5thScape chooses Ethereum for its superior technology and vibrant community</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>5thScape runs on the Ethereum network and will make use of the Skale Network Layer 2 technology to enable the scaling necessary for gaming and other virtual world activities.</span><span>This is a smart choice. Transaction costs for Layer 2 technologies that run on top of Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain are coming down following the Dencun upgrade, so ecosystems like 5thScape&rsquo;s will be beneficiaries.</span><span>But with VR there is much more than just gaming. Virtual reality technology provides a platform for commerce that will break down the boundaries between industries and magnify the value potential of each. From movies to education, there are revolutionary opportunities open to those companies and projects that can harness the technology in a way that makes it appealing and accessible for all.</span><span>The team at </span><a href="https://5thscape.com/"><span>5thScape</span></a><span> has thought through how to overcome the barriers to adoption by developing its own hardware and through the innovative use of blockchain-based software.</span></p>
<h2><span>Tokenization plus VR Ultra headset and Swiftscape VR chair set 5thScape apart&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>To work well, virtual reality and augmented reality need great hardware too. So the team at 5thScape will develop the VR Ultra headset and the Swiftscape VR chair in order to maximize comfort and ergonomics to deliver an immersive experience with precise motion tracking and intuitive controls.&nbsp;</span><span>For all the power and technological innovation (and expense) of Apple&rsquo;s Vision Pro, much of that can be for naught if the experience of wearing and using the headset is so uncomfortable it limits the engagement with the device and enjoyment.</span><span>The efforts of Meta in this field have certainly in many ways been pioneering &ndash; or at least the companies it has acquired have been. Meta&rsquo;s family of Quest headsets has helped to create a bridgehead for VR while Apple&rsquo;s mixed reality approach has literally opened the eyes of many to the possibilities, if not the wallets.&nbsp;</span><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-184500" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/15230428/1710543868-5s-2.png" alt="" width="512" height="337" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/15230428/1710543868-5s-2.png 512w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/15230428/1710543868-5s-2-300x197.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/15230428/1710543868-5s-2-150x99.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<h2><span>VR is a chance for crypto-native agile tech companies to blossom&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><span>But neither Meta nor Apple, or the other big tech companies, have shown any inclination to leverage the proven benefits of crypto as the foundation for a trustless economy that facilitates players&#8217; value interactions. That means nimble tech-savvy crypto-first innovators like 5thScape can carve out a niche for themselves and establish a competitive advantage.</span><span>The funds being raised in the presale will enable the project to complete the development and manufacture of its hardware and build out the decentralized network infrastructure.&nbsp;</span><span>5thScape is audited by </span><a href="https://github.com/Coinsult/solidity/blob/main/Coinsult_5th_Scape_0xf3...7E58_Audit.pdf"><span>Coinsult</span></a><span> and no major issues have been found with its code. Also, the project is fully KYC&rsquo;d by </span><a href="https://github.com/solidproof/projects/tree/main/2024/5th%20Scape"><span>SolidProof</span></a><span>; the team passed the KYC verification process on January 3, 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Also encouraging for potential investors, a link to </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anojkumar1988/"><span>CEO Anoj Kumar&rsquo;s LinkedIn</span></a><span> is provided on the website, as are those of the rest of the leadership team.</span><span>An active wallets widget on the homepage shows that there is purchasing activity from countries all over the world, such as Germany, Australia, the United States and Japan, to name a few. </span><a href="https://5thscape.com/"><span>$5SPACE</span></a><span> token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB or card.&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March has seen several web3 initiatives to recognize and spotlight women&#8217;s achievements in celebration of Women&#8217;s History Month. This annual observance, established in 1987, emphasizes the profound contributions women have made to society.</p>
<h2><b>Diversity Drives </b><b>Web3 Growth</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Monica Talán, Founder and Contributor at Spanish-language web3 platform CryptoConexión, told Cryptonews that raising awareness for women in web3 is not just about achieving gender balance.</p>
<p>Rather, Talán believes that highlighting <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitget-launches-10m-fund-to-support-female-led-startups-in-web3.htm">women in the web3 sector</a> will expand the field&#8217;s talent pool, leading to fresh perspectives and new approaches.</p>
<p>“This will create more equitable economic opportunities, build inclusive communities, and ensure that the future of technology reflects and serves the needs of all,” said Talán.</p>
<p>This is critical, as <a href="https://triple-a.io/digital-currencies-ownership-data/">2023 data suggests</a> that women hold about 26% of all jobs in the crypto industry. Statistics further show that only about 6% of the top leadership roles are held by women, with 94% of CEOs being male.</p>
<p>According to Talán, women make up 47% of CryptoConexión&#8217;s audience. She explained that by shifting the perspective from “believing women must adapt to web3” to “understanding that web3 must evolve to embrace women” has helped with the platform’s diversity.</p>
<p>Talán explained that CryptoConexión spotlighted <a href="https://cryptoconexion.com/mujeresweb3/">60 Latinas contributing to the web3 sector</a> at the start of Women’s History Month this year.</p>
<p>“This list also included newcomers,” said Talán. “This effort highlights the importance of representation, aiming to inspire more Latinas to join web3 and create a more inclusive, diverse digital future.”</p>
<p>Sandy Carter, COO at web3 domain platform Unstoppable Domains, told Cryptonews that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/who-are-the-most-influential-women-in-crypto.htm">women in the crypto sector</a> have indeed innovated in unique ways.</p>
<p>Carter shared that Unstoppable hosted a space on the X platform focused on “the power of tokenization and women” on March 8 – International Women’s Day.</p>
<p>“We had guests like Dr Anino Emuwa, who founded 100 Women Davos, and The Africa Women CEO Network,” she said. “We also had the Director from Boss Beauties who worked on the Mattel Barbie and Boss Beauty NFT project.”</p>

While spotlighting women may help encourage female participation in web3, in the meantime the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/entering-the-metaverse-signing-up-to-decentraland.htm">Metaverse has become a popular platform</a> for women-focused events.</p>
<p>Kim Currier, Head of Marketing at the Decentraland Foundation, told Cryptonews that from March 26-29, Decentraland will showcase the art of talented women during its second annual “Art Week” and “<a href="https://meshfair.com/">MESHfair</a>.”</p>
<p>“MESHfair is a unique opportunity for artists to explore their creativity in a virtual environment,” said Currier.</p>
<p>Currier added that women artists will represent 16 of the 32 international artists selected to show new works during MESHfair.</p>

<p>Artist and web3 producer Bay Backner founded MESHfair. Backner told Cryptonews that MESHfair acts as a way to connect artists working in the 3D file format for virtual reality (VR) with galleries and collectors.</p>
<p>“Despite widespread interest in VR, works in this format are still underrepresented in both traditional art fairs and influential NFT collections,” said Backner.</p>
<p>Backner added that 13.7% of living artists represented by galleries in Europe and North America are women.</p>
<p>“Of the 100 most expensive works ever sold, none have been made by a woman,” she said. “So there is still a long way to go towards gender equality in-real life art.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Backner believes that a similar gender gap is opening within the VR sector.</p>
<p>This may be due to a lack of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/how-to-invest-in-metaverse//">women-led Metaverse companies</a>. According to McKinsey, only <a href="https://www.consultancy.uk/news/32903/women-shut-out-of-leadership-roles-in-the-metaverse#:~:text=In%20the%20last%20five%20years,amount%20doled%20out%20by%20investors.">10% of the virtual world or metaverse companies</a> that gained funding during the 2017-2022 crypto boom were led by women.</p>
<p>“So unless we work on discoverability here – sharing the work of women entrepreneurs and creatives in VR – we’ll see the same tired old narratives being repeated,” remarked Backner.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Backner explained that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-fundraising-fell-70-per-quarter-last-year-female-startups-receive-6-3-bitget.htm">MESHfair is important for discoverability</a>.</p>
<p>“It supports the small, but growing community of creators in immersive web3 technology. And every artist in this space right now is making history,” she said. “They’re defining a new artistic medium. It’s therefore especially important that women artists are a documented and discoverable part of this conversation.”</p>
<p>A female artist by the name of “JaneDAO” told Cryptonews that displaying her work during MESHfair and Women&#8217;s History Month provides a platform to inspire through sharing and creating.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a chance to highlight the diverse creativity and insights women bring to these fields, reinforcing that art communicates universally powerful messages,” she said. “My involvement not only showcases my contributions but also shines a light on the broader impact of women in this space, sparking important conversations about our shaping role in the future of tech and art.”</p>

<h2><b>Women in Web3 Continue to be Highlighted</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Even as Women’s History Month comes to an end, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binances-crypto-perfume-for-women-receives-industry-wide-criticisms.htm">women-focused initiatives will continue</a> in hopes of encouraging women’s participation in web3.</p>
<p>Talán recognizes that the blockchain sector often presents a hurdle for women. She suggests focusing on simplifying web3 concepts and platforms, thus making the sector more approachable, as a key factor in changing the current dynamic.</p>
<p>“The technical jargon, lack of easy-to-use platforms, and fast pace can be intimidating, especially in a field historically dominated by men,” said Talán. “Despite these challenges, significant progress is being made through dedicated ongoing efforts to onboard women into web3.”</p>
<p>For example, Talán explained that initiatives like SheFi, Unstoppable Women of web3, HER DAO, Black Women Blockchain Council, and the Association for Women in Crypto are key in demystifying the space. Each of these platforms offers continued education, resources, and community support.</p>
<p>“In Latin America, ‘WAGMI LATAM’s’ collaboration with communities like Cripto Curiosas, WomenBiz, WEDAO LATAM, WARMI, Mujeres en Crypto and Metagals have shown us the importance of creating local and regional inclusive environments,” added Talán.</p>
<p>Backner further noted that she will be hosting upcoming projects geared toward women this year.</p>
<p>“My two upcoming projects are Decentraland Gaming Week (June 2024) which will support diverse creators to build interactive web3 games, and The Censored Art Show (Sept 2024) which will support digital artists impacted by censorship or shadowbanning on social media and other platforms,” she said.</p>
<p>Backner pointed out that censorship in particular is an issue that disproportionately affects women and minority digital artists.</p>
<p>“This is especially the case if artists use their own bodies within their works,” she said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Carter shared that Unstoppable will continue its commitment to increasing women&#8217;s involvement in web3 and tech in general.</p>
<p>“We plan to expand our educational initiatives, offering more workshops, courses, and mentorship programs tailored for women,” she said. “Networking events and safe spaces for discussions will continue to be a priority, ensuring women feel supported and connected.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) could breed a dangerous new category of crypto-based crime in the coming years, according to blockchain intelligence platform Chainalysis.</p>
<h2>Crypto Criminals Adopting Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
During a private video webinar viewed by <em>Cryptonews</em> on Thursday, Chainalysis Cybercrimes Research Lead Eric Jardine summarized growing and shrinking trends in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/over-24-billion-in-cryptocurrency-received-by-illicit-addresses-in-2023-down-40-from-2022-chainalysis.htm">illicit blockchain activity in 2023</a>, and predicted what sorts of tactics criminals will adopt next.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re excited to announce that our 2024 Crypto Crime Report is now available! You can download your copy here. Want a preview first? Keep reading this thread for one key takeaway from each chapter. <a href="https://t.co/t8wgHJZ8he">https://t.co/t8wgHJZ8he</a> <a href="https://t.co/MhY00Hw0yM">pic.twitter.com/MhY00Hw0yM</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Chainalysis (@chainalysis) <a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis/status/1763202696952037501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The expert said internal discussions are already underway about how rising technologies could impact blockchain crime – especially large language models (LLMs).</p>
<p>“I think that there’s ways in which they will affect different categories of crime,” said Jardine. “You could imagine an AI model that does code audits being used to improve the security of DeFi… conversely the same models could be used by illicit actors to find vulnerabilities in smart contracts.”</p>
<p>The DeFi sector is disproportionately targeted by cryptocurrency theft, with hackers exploiting flaws in code, obtaining private keys, and using price manipulation to steal assets.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-devs-put-forth-erc-7512-standard-to-represent-audit-reports-on-chain.htm">Formal audits have become something of a blockchain industry standard</a>, though their success at preventing hacks is far from foolproof. With AI, however, there’s no telling whether it will strengthen smart contacts or their attackers the most, and the balance of its benefits may oscillate over time.</p>
<p>The absolute volume of stolen DeFi funds dropped from $3.1 billion in 2022 to $1.1 billion in 2023, with the number of incidents also falling from 273 to 172.</p>
<h2>Using Artificial Intelligence For Romance Scams</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Beyond its impact on DeFi, <a href="https://www.tenable.com/blog/pig-butchering-scam-tinder-tiktok-whatsapp-telegram-scammers-steal-millions">artificial intelligence could have worrying implications for romance scams</a>, also known as &#8220;pig butchering&#8221; scams. These scams begin with seemingly innocent contact, evolving into a fabricated relationship that the scammer then exploits for financial gain.</p>
<p>“That is an area where a large language model that has infinite patience and is quite creative could be used to devastating effect by illicit actors,” Jardine added.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-bros-are-falling-for-romance-scams-at-a-record-rate-chainalysis.htm">Romance scammers in crypto nearly doubled their revenue last year compared to 2022</a>, despite a decline in total scam volume from $6.5 billion to $4.6 billion. The average size of a romance payment is $4,593, though the average victim likely paid far more since such scams often involve multiple payments.</p>
<p>As a share of all crypto transactions, illicit activity fell to just 0.34% of blockchain activity in 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin (BTC) price saw big swings on Friday, with droves of traders on both the bullish and bearish sides getting their positions wiped out as US spot Bitcoin ETF buyers continue to battle against profit-taking sellers.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-news/">BTC</a> began Friday’s session above $71,000 before selling off sharply during Asian trading session.</p>
<p>Having dropped to as low as $65,500 the Bitcoin price abruptly rallied back to $70,500 during US trading hours.</p>
<p>It was last trading around $68,000, with leveraged futures positions worth <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">$200 million having been wiped out</a>, as per coinglass.com.</p>
<p>This marked the most punishing day for the bulls since March 4, when long positions worth $244 million were liquidated.</p>
<p>Since printing fresh record highs near $74,000 on Thursday, Bitcoin has lost bullish momentum.</p>
<p>Profit-takers appear to have taken control of the market despite still elevated demand for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analyst-spot-bitcoin-etfs-anticipated-to-attract-220-billion-in-three-years.htm">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Profits At Absurd Levels, On-Chain Analysis Reveals</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As per CryptoCon, a 30-day moving average of a widely followed on-chain metric called the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio is at “absurd” levels.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> profits get high, investors get ancy to sell. ETF inflows don&#39;t change that.</p>
<p>The data shows us that we are at absurd levels of profit, the highest since 2013 on the 30-day MA profit/loss ratio.</p>
<p>The first cross of the 23 value line hasn&#39;t represented the top in the… <a href="https://t.co/2hjY1FIDwN">pic.twitter.com/2hjY1FIDwN</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoCon_/status/1768654739581857855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>CryptoCon was keen to point out that this doesn’t mean the market is necessarily close to topping.</p>
<p>But it does suggest that investors sitting on big profits are likely getting “antsy to sell”.</p>
<p>At current levels of around $68,000, the Bitcoin price is up over 60% year-to-date.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1b-inflows-as-btc-price-remains-at-all-time-highs.htm">Massive spot Bitcoin ETF inflows</a> have been the main driver of the rally. And they have been accelerating recently.</p>
<p>As per a JP Morgan research note, weekly inflows were the largest this week since their January launch.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">❖ Bitcoin ETF weekly inflows the largest since launch: JPMorgan</p>
<p>In a note covering cryptocurrency markets, JPMorgan said that Bitcoin ETF inflows were at their largest since the launch this week.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite profit-taking and a 7.5% pullback from highs, it&#8217;s no surprise that many are still confident of Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish stance.</p>
<p>That’s despite the cryptocurrency hitting a new all-time before its April halving event, rather than after.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the first time in history bitcoin has hit an all time high before the halving</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><strong>Where to Next for the Bitcoin Price?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In past Bitcoin bull markets, the price commonly reversed around 30% lower from local highs.</p>
<p>As recently as January, Bitcoin dipped from the at the time yearly high of around $49,000 to as low as $38,500.</p>
<p>That suggests that Bitcoin’s latest pullback potentially has legs. A retest of $50,000 isn’t out of the question, based on historical comparisons.</p>
<p>But ETFs may have changed the game.</p>
<p>Major institutional investors entering the Bitcoin market for the first time, with the knowledge of its volatility but also potential upside, are likely to be less price sensitive than past cohorts of Bitcoin investors.</p>
<p>They are also likely to have a “buy-the-dip” mentality that may help cushion BTC price declines.</p>
<p>Any BTC price dips now may struggle to extend beyond 10-15%.</p>
<p>That suggests $60,000 could be a near-term price floor.</p>

<p>$74,000 could easily be <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/">the pre-halving high</a>. But that could set the stage for a breakout to fresh record levels later in the year and a challenge of $100,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Applied Digital announced on March 15 that it had concluded the sale of its 200-megawatt (MW) Bitcoin mining facility to Marathon Digital Holdings for $87.3 million.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1347/marathon-digital-holdings-enters-definitive-agreement-to">the announcement</a>, the Nasdaq-listed mining company mentioned that the mining plant is in Garden City, Texas. The second quarter of 2024 is the expected date of completion for the deal.</p>
<h2>Applied Digital Announces $87.3 Million Deal</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Some stated modifications to the acquisition agreement could see <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/marathon-digital-mines-record-1853-btc-in-december-up-56-from-november.htm">Marathon Digital Holdings</a> pay a gross purchase price of $97.3 million.</p>
<p>Applied Digital CEO Wes Cummins stated that this acquisition would bolster and equip the company with more financial resources.</p>
<p>He also mentioned that this transaction would strengthen the foundation for long-term expansion and operational superiority. It will ultimately help Applied Digital concentrate on constructing HPC data centers, making it a purposeful pivot.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reported that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-15/bitcoin-miner-marathon-mara-plans-to-make-purchases-to-offset-reward-halving">Marathon intends to purchase more mining sites</a> in preparation for Bitcoin&#8217;s halving event.</p>
<p>The facility was built in 2023. Before this acquisition, Marathon served as a hosting client and had earlier used the site for a hosting agreement. Marathon will remain a hosting client at Applied Digital&#8217;s North Dakota data center even after acquiring the Texas facility.</p>
<p>Applied Digital also reiterated its commitment to improve and grow its HPC (high-performance computing) potential.</p>
<p>The company also announced a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/03/14/2846218/0/en/Applied-Digital-Secures-Contract-with-AI-Customer-Together-AI.html">collaboration with Together AI</a> earlier this week. The partnership will see Together AI use Applied Digital&#8217;s Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) for its operations.</p>
<p>Many companies in the Bitcoin mining industry are now diversifying into the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ai-and-crypto-mining-to-more-than-double-energy-use-by-2026-report-says.htm">generative AI industry</a>. Joining them is the Nasdaq-listed mining company, which is now set to also experiment with generative AI technologies.</p>
<h2>Marathon Digital’s BitCoin Mining Exploits</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:664">In late February, Marathon reported a self-mining hash rate of 28.7 exahashes per second (EH/s). With Bitcoin&#8217;s next halving scheduled for April 20, the block reward is expected to decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:664">To strengthen its position for this, Marathon has strategically bolstered its financial resources. As of January 31, Marathon possessed over $1 billion in unrestricted cash and bitcoin combined. Financial projections indicate this will propel the company&#8217;s hash rate to a projected 50 EH/s by the end of 2025.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:359">Additionally, Marathon has made major moves to expand its mining capacity. In January, the company acquired two mining sites in Nebraska and Texas for approximately $179 million (390 MW).</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:359">This latest acquisition of Applied Digital&#8217;s Texas Bitcoin mining facility further solidifies Marathon&#8217;s role as a major player in the digital asset mining industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>French Montana opted for a unique release strategy for his previously unreleased track &#8220;Bag Curious.&#8221; On March 14, the Mac &amp; Cheese 5 account on X (formerly Twitter) announced that the song had been inscribed ont the Bitcoin blockchain. This marks an early example of a mainstream musician exploring blockchain distribution.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/5MacandCheese/status/1768222802711085163?s=20">The Mac &amp; Cheese 5 account</a> detailed the process of this event, stating that it made the singer the first mainstream artist to inscribe a complete song onto the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<h2 data-sourcepos="9:1-9:47"><strong>Bitcoin Ordinals and French Montana&#8217;s Inscription</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:244">Prior to its release, French Montana&#8217;s use of the Bitcoin blockchain generated mixed discussions within online communities. The Mac &amp; Cheese 5 account reported a high level of engagement, citing 50,000 comments related to the project.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:379">Commentary surrounding the release ranged from enthusiastic to critical. Some members of the music community expressed support for French Montana&#8217;s utilization of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/blockchain-technology/">blockchain technology</a> for distribution, highlighting its immutability and resistance to censorship. Others voiced concerns surrounding the use of the Bitcoin blockchain for purposes beyond financial transactions.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:303">The potential use of Bitcoin Ordinals within the music industry raises questions about the balance between innovation and the blockchain&#8217;s intended function. French Montana&#8217;s &#8220;Bag Curious&#8221; project could potentially encourage further exploration of decentralized technologies within the creative sectors.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Specifically, Bitcoin’s allocation is 3.7 times greater than that of gold. Additionally, they pointed out a net inflow of $9 billion into Bitcoin ETFs since their inception, which offsets outflows from Grayscale.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The analyst highlighted the accelerated inflows of over $10 billion into <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analyst-spot-bitcoin-etfs-anticipated-to-attract-220-billion-in-three-years.htm">spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> since their approval in January and claimed the potential BTC ETF market size could reach $62 billion, using gold as a benchmark. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-expects-62-billion-bitcoin-spot-etfs-market-over-2-to-3-years.htm"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-expects-62-billion-bitcoin-spot-etfs-market-over-2-to-3-years.htm"> from JPM Securities</a> predicts that the spot Bitcoin ETF market could expand to as much as $220 billion in the next two to three years, projecting a substantial impact on Bitcoin’s price due to increased capital inflows.</span></p>
<p>The approval of BTC ETFs has already positively affected the crypto market. In the past month, the total market capitalization soared by nearly 40% to $2.2 trillion. Bitcoin and Ethereum were the primary drivers, increasing by 45% and 47% respectively.</p>
<p>Altcoins also benefited, experiencing double-digit gains, alongside further growth in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/defi-news/">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-news/">non-fungible token (NFT)</a> sectors.</p>
<p>Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a notable increase in net sales, reaching $6.1 billion in February compared to $1.5 billion in January. On top of this, BTC surged by 31% in a month, reaching an all-time high of over $73,800 – a rise that coincided with inflows into spot BTC ETFs. Crypto mining stocks mirrored this trend, also reaching new record highs in February.</p>
<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETFs Expected to Grow: Analyst Projections See $62 Billion Market Within 3 Years</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Early this month, JPMorgan analysts estimated that only 7% ($230 billion) of the $3.3 trillion global investment in gold is held in funds, with the remaining portion stored in bars and coins.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Drawing a parallel with the gold market, analysts applied a volatility ratio of 3.7 to project a potential size of<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-expects-62-billion-bitcoin-spot-etfs-market-over-2-to-3-years.htm"> $62 billion for the spot BTC ETF market within the next two to three years</a>. This figure, however, might primarily reflect a shift of existing investments from other instruments towards ETFs rather than entirely new capital entering the market.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs (excluding Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) have already attracted $19 billion in cumulative inflows, representing nearly half of the $36 billion rotational shift anticipated by JPMorgan for the entirety of 2024. Accounting for the $10 billion outflow from GBTC, net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs remain at an impressive $9 billion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, net sales for spot BTC ETFs also saw a significant climb, reaching $6.1 billion in February, compared to $1.5 billion in January. The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1b-inflows-as-btc-price-remains-at-all-time-highs.htm">largest daily inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> hit a peak of over $1 billion on March 12, with analysts speculating that this figure could rise further once outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF cease.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bears can&#39;t win this game until spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETF inflow stops.</p>
<p>Last week, spot ETFs saw netflows of +30K BTC. Known entities like exchanges and miners hold around 3M BTC, including 1.5M BTC by US entities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The European Commission formally enquired into strategies adopted by big tech companies on March 14 to mitigate generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) risks capable of misleading election voters. The commission has given big tech an April 3 deadline to provide documents and information to its requests.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-sends-requests-information-generative-ai-risks-6-very-large-online-platforms-and-2-very">European Commission issued the official request</a> to big technological companies including Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Google Search, Bing, Snapchat, and YouTube.</p>
<h2>European Commission Questions Big Techs over Generative AI’s Hazards</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-14/tech-giants-face-eu-grilling-over-use-of-generative-ai-tools">According to Bloomberg</a>, this was conveyed in a formal request for information (RFI).</p>
<p>The commission asked the companies to provide further information about hazards posed by generative AI.</p>
<p>This is because the big tech companies allow users to create and spread content using the technology.</p>
<p>The EU is most concerned about the precautions to mitigate the risks of generative AI to election voters, believing that the spread of viral deepfakes and automated service manipulation can impact voters&#8217; perceptions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is now proposed legislation requiring gen AI companies to share details of their training data in the US, the EU and the UK. It’s not perfect, but it’s a strong move in the right direction.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Following the information requests, the European Commission has the authority to impose penalties for errors, inconsistencies, or misrepresentation.</p>
<p>This decision follows the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package">EU&#8217;s recent e-commerce and online governance regulations</a> &#8212; the Digital Services Act (DSA).</p>
<p>This act classified eight platforms as Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs). In this light, it has mandated VLOPs to assess and manage systemic risks in addition to following other outlined guidelines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, election security is another area of concern that the commission is looking into as it seeks answers to the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/generative-ai-legal-challenges-and-opportunities.htm">impact of generative AI</a> on election processes.</p>
<p>Other concerns include gender-based violence, distribution of illicit content, defense of fundamental rights, minors, as well as mental health.</p>
<h2>EU Moves Towards Election Security Rules</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The European Commission has been actively looking into the impact of AI on voters, even as the use of AI increases across all fields.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/AlgorithmWatch_AIForensics_Bing_Chat_Report.pdf">recent study showed</a> the capacity of AI to spread misinformation among voters, for example.</p>
<p>The EU is already counting down to March 27 to finalize election security regulations. The European body has been <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-gathering-views-draft-dsa-guidelines-election-integrity">requesting feedback</a> on election security statutes including by public consultations.</p>
<p>This recent RFI to the big tech companies is considered a crucial request that will aid the creation of the EU’s election security policy.</p>
<p>Once created, the policy will help combat lingering election security challenges – including misinformation among voters.</p>

<p>“The SEC&#8217;s approvals have provided a green light for Wall Street to sell volatile cryptocurrency investments to ordinary Americans through their brokerage and retirement accounts,” the letter read.</p>
<p>The democratic senators also cited the January 2024 report from the <a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2024/finra-publishes-crypto-asset-communications-sweep-update">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)</a> showing that an estimated 70% of brokers’ communications to retail investors regarding cryptocurrencies violated fair disclosure rules.</p>
<p>“These alarming deficiencies raise significant concerns that brokers and advisers may now provide incomplete or deceptive information about bitcoin ETPs to retail investors,” Reed and Butler stated.</p>
<h2>How Likely Is A Spot Ethereum ETF?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Reed and Butler’s letter follows the SEC’s January approval of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/analyst-spot-bitcoin-etfs-anticipated-to-attract-220-billion-in-three-years.htm">several spot bitcoin ETFs</a>, causing bitcoin’s price to surge. Earlier this week, the token’s price soared over $73,000 to mark an all-time high during its latest rally.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency&#8217;s rally coincides with rising discussions regarding the potential SEC approval of a spot Ethereum ETF, with experts plummeting the estimated <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1767204301372297274">chances of approval in May</a> to just 35%.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>“The blockbuster success of the Bitcoin ETF is upsetting to high-ranking Dems,” wrote Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas. “Buyer’s remorse. This is part of why we are pessimistic re spot Eth etf approval chances.&#8221;</p>
<h2>SEC To Monitor Brokers&#8217; Communications About ETFs?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meanwhile, the senators alleged that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/a-beginner-s-guide-to-bitcoin-etfs.htm">Bitcoin ETFs</a> should be referred to as exchange-traded products (ETPs) due to the lack of “restrictions on harmful practices that apply to most investment funds marketed to retail investors,” including limits on leverage, custody requirements, and examination by the SEC.</p>
<p>“Although it may seem like a small distinction, this purposeful confusion of terminology is troubling because bitcoin ETPs are different in critical ways from mutual funds and ETFs,” the senators stated.</p>
<p>The letter then requested Gensler to closely monitor communications from brokers and advisors <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-price-prediction-as-eth-crosses-4000-level-new-all-time-high-coming.htm">regarding ETFs</a> as well as to ensure Bitcoin ETFs &#8220;do not use inappropriate and confusing naming conventions&#8221; in official filings.</p>
<p>“These steps would help protect investors from fraud and abuse, which may be enabled by the current light-touch regulatory regime applicable to Bitcoin ETPs,” the letter concluded.</p>
<p>As of time of publication, Gensler has yet to publicly reply to the letter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, Binance quietly split from its venture capital division, Binance Labs, and established as an independent entity now valued at $10 billion. This change in operation became effective on March 15 under Binance&#8217;s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, Richard Teng, who assumed the role four months ago.</p>
<h2>Binance Labs Severs Ties, Maintains Branding</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-15/crypto-exchange-binance-spins-off-binance-labs-venture-capital-unit">A disclaimer announcing the split</a> was published on the website saying, “Binance Labs is an independent venture and not part of the Binance Group nor is it involved in any of the businesses operated by the Binance Group (including but not limited to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange).”</p>
<p>Following the effect of this change in operation, personnel at Binance Labs now operate under separate employment agreements from Binance exchange staff. This is in line with the arrangements that are effective at the Binance-backed blockchain network, BNB Chain.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In an unexpected move, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> has spun off its venture capital arm, Binance Labs, into an independent entity valued at $10 billion. </p>
<p>This strategic decision aims to enhance operational efficiency and growth under the leadership of CEO Richard Teng. Despite the separation,…</p>
<p>&mdash; Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) <a href="https://twitter.com/Satoshi_Talks/status/1768645312854302821?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Investment Director at Binance Labs, Alex Odagiu noted that they are no longer affiliated with the Binance group as well. He said this while clarifying that the venture capital entity would continue to use the Binance brand under a licensing agreement.</p>
<p>Binance Labs has invested in over 250 projects since it launched. There are many companies in its portfolio that have been impacted by this transition into an independent firm. Some are industry giants like PancakeSwap, Polygon, Sky Mavis, and Curve DAO. Aptos Labs, LayerZero, and The Sandbox are some of the other companies involved.</p>
<p>In February, Binance Labs <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-labs-backs-babylon-pioneering-native-bitcoin-staking-protocol.htm">invested in Babylon</a>, a Bitcoin staking protocol that introduced the concept of native Bitcoin staking. The investment enables users to stake their Bitcoins on Proof-of-Stake blockchains and earn yields without relying on third-party custody. This bridges services, or token wrapping mechanisms.</p>
<p>The unfolding events at Binance have been on the crypto community&#8217;s radar since a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/secs-absence-at-binance-settlement-announcement-raises-questions.htm">November settlement with US authorities.</a> The authorities charged Binance $4.3 billion and demanded that founder and CEO <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-cz-zhao-resigns-and-pleads-guilty-whats-going-on.htm">Changpeng Zhao step down</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its newfound independence, Binance Labs&#8217; core operations are expected to stay unaffected, with an emphasis on finding and investing in promising crypto projects.</p>
<h2>Venture Capital Trend Among Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In 2018, Yi He, who heads Binance Labs and co-founded Binance alongside Zhao launched the venture capital division.</p>
<p>As a venture capital and incubator, Binance Labs uses funds from the exchange&#8217;s profits to back early-stage crypto projects.</p>
<p>The splitting of these two entities does not appear to be a cause for major concern within the Binance ecosystem.</p>
<p>Binance still holds the largest market share of centralized exchanges (CEXs), accounting for about 50% of global trading volume.</p>
<p>The Binance native token, BNB, has experienced a slight decline since the news broke, however. At the time of reporting, BNB was trading at $584.31, representing a decrease of 2.81%.</p>
<p>Aside from Binance, popular exchanges in the crypto industry, such as Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken have also established <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-vc-firms/">venture capital businesses</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-ventures-invests-more-in-startups-outside-the-us-especially-in-india-singapore-australia-and-the-uk.htm">Coinbase Ventures</a> was the second-most active investor in the crypto sector in 2023, according to data from PitchBook. Odagiu admitted that in Binance Lab’s case, the transition will not have much impact on the company.</p>

<h2><strong>What Is SPONGEV2 and How Could It Repeat The Success of SPONGE V1?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Sponge V1 made its debut during the bear market of May 2023, a fair launch token that instantly captivated meme coin virality due to its nostalgic and catchy namesake.</p>
<p>In a dramatic climb, the first SPONGE token exploded to become on of the biggest meme coin launches of the year &#8211; hitting an all-time high market cap of over $100M and generating a community of more than 13,000 holders (and an additional 30,000 followers on social media).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-184320 size-full" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/15162729/1710520049-1708695860-1708432273-1708090646-1705488575-screenshot-212.png" alt="As meme coin markets explode into bull market posture, explore Sponge Price Analysis and explore undiscovered crypto set for skyrocket.

<p>Much of these major price gains were fuelled by listings on more than 10 centralized exchanges, including LBank, Toobit, CoinW, BTCEX, Poloniex, MEXC, Gate.io, Bitget, BitKan, and BitMart.</p>
<p>And this is why crypto whales are now betting big on SPONGE V2.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/sponge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Sponge V2</a> was not a traditional launch, to acquire this new token &#8211; early holders had two options &#8211; either buying SPONGE V1 and then staking it through the Sponge website, or, staking already held SPONGE V1.</p>
<p>The SPONGE V2 airdrop saw tokens distributed based upon the quantity and length of time V1 tokens were staked.</p>
<p>But the hype behind SPONGE V2 doesn&#8217;t stop at the network migration it also seeks to deliver Play-to-Earn (P2E) utility to the Sponge ecosystem.</p>
<h2><strong>SPONGE V2 Play-2-Earn Promise Could Supercharge Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Sponge V2 team is developing a bespoke <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/sponge">Play-to-Earn</a> (P2E) game, bringing an exciting new utility to the token.</p>
<p>Users will have the opportunity to earn $SPONGEV2 tokens by playing the game and ranking on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>The game will feature both free and paid versions, allowing users to play for fun or use $SPONGEV2 tokens to purchase game credits for additional in-game earnings.</p>
<h2><strong>SPONGE V2 Price Analysis: As SPONGE V2 Climbs To $1M Market Cap &#8211; Could It Repeat 100X?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
At the time of writing, SPONGE V2 is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/polygon/pair-explorer/0xa01f64fa1b923dd9c5c7618b39a6ba8098a88863?t=1710521982270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.003087</a> (representing a 24-hour change of -7.14%).</p>
<p>This comes as price continues to wrestle with a minor -26% localized retracement move after rising to establish a new early-stage all-time high at $0.004240 on March 9.</p>
<p>Now in consolidation, SPONGE V2 has established a well-defended lower support zone between $0.0027 and $0.0031 over the past week &#8211; priming price action for its next leg-up.</p>

<p>Upside movements are now targeting a pushback above higher supper at $0.00365 as buy-pressure remains dominant over the past 24-hours representing 59% of transactions.</p>
<p>Overall, price analysis leaves SPONGE V2 in a bullish ascendant trading channel in the weekend, with price primed for a bounce ahead of major exchange listings following a successful consolidation.</p>
<p>Still representing a fantastic entry at $1.1m &#8211; if crypto whales are right &#8211; this project could undertake as much as a 100x return from current levels (based on historical market caps).</p>
<h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As <a href="https://cryptonews.com/visit/sponge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored">Sponge V2</a> heads towards major exchange listings, crypto whales are rushing to accumulate in anticipation of major gains, bringing a new chapter to the already remarkable history of SPONGE token.</p>
<p>The team’s commitment to utility, staking, and a P2E game makes Sponge V2 a project to watch closely.</p>

<h2>El Salvador&#8217;s Historic Bitcoin Adoption: Future of Nation-Building Redefined</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/countries-in-which-bitcoin-is-banned-or-legal.htm">El Salvador became the first nation to use bitcoin as legal tender</a> in September 2021 when bitcoin was trading around $51,000.</p>
<p>News of the country’s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/difference-of-bitcoin-from-traditional-currencies.htm">latest Bitcoin strategy</a> comes as the token reached an all-time high of over $73,000 earlier this week.</p>
<p>Its price has been rallying in recent months following the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024.</p>
<p>The rally is expected to intensify as anticipation builds for the token&#8217;s quadrennial halving event, scheduled to occur next month.</p>
<p>As of March 15, Bukele’s announcement received over 2,000 replies on X, most of which are seemingly positive.</p>
<p>“El Salvador is a case study on how to positively transform a country,” <a href="https://x.com/OtherKindsMoney/status/1768428601446482094?s=20">one X user wrote</a>.</p>

<h2>El Salvador On Track To Become One Of The Richest Countries In The World?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Meanwhile, a number of U.S. officials have lambasted the country’s crypto-forward policy, with U.S. senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/MCC22059.pdf">originally introducing</a> “Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador Act” in 2022, citing U.S. security and trade concerns.</p>
<p>“Using cryptocurrency as legal tender could weaken economic and financial stability and empower malign actors,” <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/rep/release/risch-menendez-reintroduce-legislation-to-mitigate-risks-of-el-salvadors-adoption-of-bitcoin">said Risch</a>. “Given U.S. interest on prosperity and transparency in Central America, we must seek greater clarity on how the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender may impact El Salvador’s financial and economic stability, as well as El Salvador’s capacity to effectively combat money laundering and illicit finances.”</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/el-salvador-may-become-one-of-the-worlds-richest-countries-due-to-bitcoin-holdings.htm">based on the country’s current bitcoin holdings</a>, U.S. lawmakers may have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>“Within maybe 30 or 40 years, El Salvador will have gone from the poorest, most crime ridden country, to maybe one of the richest, most innovative countries in the world, just in that period of time,” venture capitalist Tim Draper said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1JI1WZXEQw">Rachel Wolfson’s Web3 Deep Dive podcast</a>. “And this is just because they embraced Bitcoin.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rumors are spreading like wildfire across the crypto grapevine that the state of Qatar could be making a huge, possibly multibillion-dollar huge, Bitcoin (BTC) bet soon.</p>
<p>At least one <a href="https://financefeeds.com/did-qatar-really-invest-3-3-billion-in-bitcoin/">article</a> claims the Middle Eastern nation may have already made the leap and purchased 50,000 BTC in a series of daily installments of 100 BTC each.</p>
<p>As yet, there is no substantial evidence tying the Emir of Qatar or the state&#8217;s Sovereign Wealth Fund, the <a href="https://www.qia.qa/en/About/Pages/default.aspx">Qatar Investment Authority</a> (QIA), to a giant Bitcoin investment, although rumors have tended that way <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/qatars-sovereign-wealth-fund-dives-into-bitcoin-with-potential-500b-investment-confirmed-news-or-just-rumors.htm">since</a> December.</p>
<p>Still, there are only a few explanations for the mysterious case of the &#8220;Mr 100,&#8221; and in any case, one thing is clear: there is some hefty whale movement around Bitcoin between the successful launch of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs back in January and the upcoming halving on April 19, a quadrennial event that halves miners&#8217; Bitcoin revenue and thereby the new supply.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get into why some people think Qatar&#8217;s Sovereign Wealth Fund is diversifying with Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Qatar&#8217;s Emir Warms To Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The rumor mill began churning back in December last year when Bitcoin maxi influencer Max Keiser tweeted, &#8220;the rumors are getting very loud on this&#8221; while suggesting the QIA was possibly looking to buy half a trillion in Bitcoin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A series of reports add weight to Kaiser&#8217;s claim that Qatar is becoming Bitcoin curious.</p>
<p>Firstly, people noted the warming relations between Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and El Salvador President and notorious Bitcoin bull Nayib Bukele. Bukele made Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador back in 2021 and the country is speculated to have 5,689.68 BTC.</p>
<p>A picture also made the rounds on social media of Qatar&#8217;s Executive Gulfstream G650ER jet at an airport in Madeira, Portugal, a day after MicroStrategy executive chairman, co-founder and Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor&#8217;s talk at Bitcoin Atlantis. MicroStrategy is the largest institutional Bitcoin whale with an eye-watering 193,000 BTC on its balance sheet, about $13 billion today.</p>

<p>Still, institutions are banned from using Bitcoin in Qatar and have been since 2018, when the country&#8217;s Central Bank issued a <a href="https://freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/qatar/">circular</a> to that effect to all the banks in the territory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) plummeted 12% in the space of 24 hours to trade at $2.85 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, all leading meme coins share the same fate today, with market leaders Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and PEPE posting similar losses.</p>
<p>Crypto&#8217;s novelty coin sector is bearing the brunt of a broader market downturn that has today shaved 6% from market leader Bitcoin (BTC) which was trading at all-time highs earlier yesterday, but now sells at $68,118.</p>
<p>Nearest contender Ethereum (ETH) also shed 5% overnight and changes hands at $3,711.54.</p>
<p>Crypto has been doing well for most of the year-to-date off the back of hype around 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs the SEC approved for trading on January 10.</p>
<p>The ETFs have been very successful. So far they have collectively netted <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-15/bitcoin-btc-price-dips-from-record-as-bubble-talk-grows-louder?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2">$12 billion</a>, helping Bitcoin set a new all-time high of <span data-price-target="price" data-price-json="{&quot;aed&quot;:270832.0669156944,&quot;ars&quot;:62658240.79648604,&quot;aud&quot;:111439.55350626324,&quot;bch&quot;:270.6770577460594,&quot;bdt&quot;:8091215.988314361,&quot;bhd&quot;:27794.114137221193,&quot;bmd&quot;:73737.9364849832,&quot;bnb&quot;:143061.5164520744,&quot;brl&quot;:380542.0056553954,&quot;btc&quot;:1.0033005057217026,&quot;cad&quot;:99381.40996668336,&quot;chf&quot;:64879.50322329624,&quot;clp&quot;:70749614.18166593,&quot;cny&quot;:530374.8557555386,&quot;czk&quot;:1703814.3605756166,&quot;dkk&quot;:502619.8964625912,&quot;dot&quot;:8268.238228009446,&quot;eos&quot;:75439.31567898425,&quot;eth&quot;:624.2026756165253,&quot;eur&quot;:67405.3962375893,&quot;gbp&quot;:57639.17523983572,&quot;gel&quot;:195418.55730459504,&quot;hkd&quot;:576787.7251172813,&quot;huf&quot;:26873105.539642688,&quot;idr&quot;:1149293683.3734622,&quot;ils&quot;:270420.1259941225,&quot;inr&quot;:6110932.308668408,&quot;jpy&quot;:10906157.879255911,&quot;krw&quot;:97195530.98364732,&quot;kwd&quot;:22650.598115647696,&quot;lkr&quot;:22592283.544566188,&quot;ltc&quot;:838.0129740364276,&quot;mmk&quot;:154750684.2782103,&quot;mxn&quot;:1409247.1249294062,&quot;myr&quot;:345646.5772733587,&quot;ngn&quot;:118524884.34723207,&quot;nok&quot;:773633.80444196,&quot;nzd&quot;:119746.72195478815,&quot;php&quot;:4084270.7114426116,&quot;pkr&quot;:20569197.38248603,&quot;pln&quot;:288842.83326363453,&quot;rub&quot;:6746468.932467607,&quot;sar&quot;:276539.60441344156,&quot;sek&quot;:755545.5903581448,&quot;sgd&quot;:98280.50257496253,&quot;thb&quot;:2631375.1324348687,&quot;try&quot;:2368816.60946866,&quot;twd&quot;:2323592.985546547,&quot;uah&quot;:2856688.8448963165,&quot;usd&quot;:73737.9364849832,&quot;vef&quot;:8618768857.093742,&quot;vnd&quot;:1820914621.7579532,&quot;xag&quot;:3040.0481077527425,&quot;xau&quot;:37.7153686383122,&quot;xdr&quot;:55169.175581398296,&quot;xlm&quot;:517336.0996552501,&quot;xrp&quot;:159288.0595044857,&quot;yfi&quot;:11.59318171251923,&quot;zar&quot;:1375794.3459012401,&quot;bits&quot;:1058235.7939525498,&quot;link&quot;:74906.24576061158,&quot;sats&quot;:105823579.39525498}" data-prev-price="73737.9364849832">$73,737.94</span> yesterday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the ETFs took in $1 billion in inflows, with BlackRock’s accounting for the $848 million bulk of it.</p>
<p>However the release that day of last month’s <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">hot US inflation readings</a> appear to have dampened enthusiasm for riskier assets this weekend.</p>
<p>Over on WIF&#8217;s trading chart we can see a gradual rally from the end of February that starts to get volatile around a week into March.</p>
<p>The sudden upward momentum on Tuesday March 12 was very bullish but it fizzled out by Thursday.</p>
<p>Given WIF&#8217;s Relative Strength Index (RSI) of about 50, it&#8217;s not likely to decline unless Bitcoin does. In any case, WIF will find strong support at $2.</p>

<h2>WIF Memes Offer Less Utility Than VR Gaming Tokens</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
WIF is pure meme stock, which makes it a volatile allocation for any portfolio. Meme coins are highly whimsical in nature and their pricing often exaggerates market trends.</p>
<p>For instance, when Bitcoin was rallying last week, meme coins were rallying even harder. Today, when Bitcoin and Ethereum are posting losses, leading meme coins are posting heavier ones.</p>
<p>Investors who want to support the altcoin sector should really limit their exposure to altcoins. Since their value is dictated by their viral appeal and trendiness rather than their underlying protocol, a sudden loss of interest could be disastrous for holders.</p>
<p>Blockchain proponents believe that the future of gaming will incorporate blockchain tech to handle and record payments. Not only will blockchain be more integrated in gaming, it will also be more present in the wider web. Advocates of the idea refer to this iteration of the internet as Web 3.</p>
<p>Another technology that will drive future innovations in gaming and the web is virtual reality (VR). With that in mind, it would seem that the crypto projects that are most ahead of the curve are VR gaming projects like <a href="https://www.cryptonews.com/ext/5thscape/en" rel="sponsored nofollow">5th Scape</a> ($5SCAPE).</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In response to the attack, NFPrompt took swift action to mitigate further losses. They swiftly transferred ownership of its smart contracts to new addresses, effectively isolating the hackers. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the platform assures that NFP tokens and other assets remain secure, the token&#8217;s price has drastically dropped by over 15% within the last 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">NFPrompt urges users to exercise caution and refrain from accepting NFPs from unreliable sources. Additionally, they advise solely trading the token on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-exchanges/">established centralized exchanges (CEXs)</a> until further updates regarding the incident.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Collaborative efforts are underway with partner CEXs to suspend NFP deposits while investigations proceed. NFPrompt has also requested that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) temporarily halt NFP liquidity pool activities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Specific CEXs have been notified to freeze transactions potentially linked to the hackers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to its recent statement, NFPrompt has partnered with leading Web3 security firms SlowMist and Chainalysis.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meme coin BONK&#8217;s price has risen 28% over the last two weeks, buoyed by a crypto buying frenzy that has driven market leader <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-29.htm">Bitcoin to new highs</a>.</p>
<p>BONK managed to post $720,000 in overnight trading volume, according to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bonk">CoinGecko</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it wasn&#8217;t enough to keep the novelty cryptocurrency from sliding out of the <a href="http://$0.00002966">top five meme coins</a> by market capitalization.</p>
<p>BONK also fell from the 60th largest cryptocurrency by market cap this time last week to 63rd today.</p>
<p>Prices across the entire market have been pulling back over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>BONK is currently one of the bigger casualties after posting the biggest intraday losses among the top 6 meme coins. BONK fell 15% overnight and currently trades for $0.00002966.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) dramatic pullback in the last 24 hours has made the market cautious. The number one cryptocurrency by market capitalization currently trades at $67,056, making for intraday losses of 7%.</p>
<p>Crypto has been doing well for most of the year-to-date off the back of hype around 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs the SEC approved for trading on January 10.</p>
<p>The ETFs have been doing well. So far they have collectively netted <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-15/bitcoin-btc-price-dips-from-record-as-bubble-talk-grows-louder?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2">$12 billion</a>, helping Bitcoin set a new all-time high of <span data-price-target="price" data-price-json="{&quot;aed&quot;:270832.0669156944,&quot;ars&quot;:62658240.79648604,&quot;aud&quot;:111439.55350626324,&quot;bch&quot;:270.6770577460594,&quot;bdt&quot;:8091215.988314361,&quot;bhd&quot;:27794.114137221193,&quot;bmd&quot;:73737.9364849832,&quot;bnb&quot;:143061.5164520744,&quot;brl&quot;:380542.0056553954,&quot;btc&quot;:1.0033005057217026,&quot;cad&quot;:99381.40996668336,&quot;chf&quot;:64879.50322329624,&quot;clp&quot;:70749614.18166593,&quot;cny&quot;:530374.8557555386,&quot;czk&quot;:1703814.3605756166,&quot;dkk&quot;:502619.8964625912,&quot;dot&quot;:8268.238228009446,&quot;eos&quot;:75439.31567898425,&quot;eth&quot;:624.2026756165253,&quot;eur&quot;:67405.3962375893,&quot;gbp&quot;:57639.17523983572,&quot;gel&quot;:195418.55730459504,&quot;hkd&quot;:576787.7251172813,&quot;huf&quot;:26873105.539642688,&quot;idr&quot;:1149293683.3734622,&quot;ils&quot;:270420.1259941225,&quot;inr&quot;:6110932.308668408,&quot;jpy&quot;:10906157.879255911,&quot;krw&quot;:97195530.98364732,&quot;kwd&quot;:22650.598115647696,&quot;lkr&quot;:22592283.544566188,&quot;ltc&quot;:838.0129740364276,&quot;mmk&quot;:154750684.2782103,&quot;mxn&quot;:1409247.1249294062,&quot;myr&quot;:345646.5772733587,&quot;ngn&quot;:118524884.34723207,&quot;nok&quot;:773633.80444196,&quot;nzd&quot;:119746.72195478815,&quot;php&quot;:4084270.7114426116,&quot;pkr&quot;:20569197.38248603,&quot;pln&quot;:288842.83326363453,&quot;rub&quot;:6746468.932467607,&quot;sar&quot;:276539.60441344156,&quot;sek&quot;:755545.5903581448,&quot;sgd&quot;:98280.50257496253,&quot;thb&quot;:2631375.1324348687,&quot;try&quot;:2368816.60946866,&quot;twd&quot;:2323592.985546547,&quot;uah&quot;:2856688.8448963165,&quot;usd&quot;:73737.9364849832,&quot;vef&quot;:8618768857.093742,&quot;vnd&quot;:1820914621.7579532,&quot;xag&quot;:3040.0481077527425,&quot;xau&quot;:37.7153686383122,&quot;xdr&quot;:55169.175581398296,&quot;xlm&quot;:517336.0996552501,&quot;xrp&quot;:159288.0595044857,&quot;yfi&quot;:11.59318171251923,&quot;zar&quot;:1375794.3459012401,&quot;bits&quot;:1058235.7939525498,&quot;link&quot;:74906.24576061158,&quot;sats&quot;:105823579.39525498}" data-prev-price="73737.9364849832">$73,737.94</span> yesterday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the ETFs took in $1 billion in inflows, with BlackRock’s accounting for the $848 million bulk of it, however the release that day of last month’s <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">hot US inflation readings</a> appear to have dampened enthusiasm for riskier assets.</p>
<p>Over on the trading chart we can see the late February/early March rally very clearly outlined by volatile peaks and troughs although BONK appears to find strong support at the $0.30 price range. A Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 38 indicates heavy selling that may continue to drive the price down in the near-term.</p>

<p>Given that today&#8217;s loss is largely the result of profit-taking from traders, PEPE has every chance of rebounding again soon enough.</p>
<p>And as the market continues to gain in bullishness, the meme token could even break its new ATH in the next few weeks.</p>
<h2>Pepe Price Prediction as PEPE Drops 17% Overnight – What&#8217;s Going On?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
PEPE may have dived badly overnight, but its chart and indicators suggest that now may be a great time to buy.</p>
<p>Most notably, its relative strength index (purple) has resumed rising again after almost hitting rock bottom (30) in the early hours of this morning.</p>

<p>In other words, it looks like it&#8217;s on the way back up, even if its 30-day average (yellow) is still falling.</p>
<p>Yet the average is arguably cancelled out by PEPE&#8217;s support level (green), which is still rising and which prevented the coin from falling too far last night.</p>
<p>At the same time, PEPE&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume remains close to $2.5 billion, indicating substantial interest in the token.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s likely that whales who had previously bought the coin have taken some profits in the past day or so, yet PEPE hasn&#8217;t fallen any harder than many other alts and meme coins.</p>
<p>As such, it&#8217;s likely to rebound soon enough, with the market remaining positive overall.</p>
<p>This is largely because of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-blackrocks-spot-etf-holdings-surpass-microstrategy-are-institutional-investors-here.htm">rising Bitcoin ETF volumes</a>, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/will-the-sec-approve-ethereum-etfs-this-year.htm">the possibility of Ethereum ETFs</a> – and the approaching Bitcoin halving – also improving the wider picture.</p>
<p>The PEPE price could easily set a new ATH in the next few weeks, while potentially reaching $0.000020 by the second half of the year.</p>

<p>As a meme token with weak fundamentals it will always have the tendency to drop suddenly, but the medium- and long-term trajectory of the market should help push it up as a whole.</p>
<h2>New Meme Tokens Bring Greater Potential</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Given that PEPE is now a well-established coin, some traders may prefer to diversify into newer, smaller cap meme tokens, especially those on course to rally big as they list on new exchanges.</p>
<p>This includes coins that have recently launched their own presales, with one of the most interesting in this category being new Ethereum-based <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20">meme token Dogecoin20 (DOGE20)</a>.</p>
<p>It launched its presale only yesterday, yet it has already raised over $280,000, as it wins over more investors.</p>

<p>The reason why Dogecoin20 is so exciting is that it takes the basic appeal of meme coins such as DOGE and combines it with a bullish staking system, a hard-capped supply, and a commitment to supporting more venerable causes.</p>
<p>As an Ethereum-based coin, it will enable staking, with its protocol providing greater rewards to holders who stake early and for longer periods.</p>
<p>Another interesting facet is that it will regularly distribute a portion of its supply to charitable causes, as well as to projects based within its own community.</p>
<p>The aim of this is to encourage greater engagement and commitment to its development, which in the long run can only help it grow.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth pointing out that, unlike the infinitely inflationary Dogecoin, DOGE20 has limited itself to a max supply of 140 billion tokens.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>25% of this supply is going to its presale, with the rest going to a mix of marketing, treasury (for development and community/charity purposes), staking and liquidity.</p>
<p>In combination, these features promise to give DOGE20 plenty of appeal, helping to push its price up over time.</p>
<p>Investors can join its presale now by going to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20">its official website</a>, where they can buy 1 DOGE20 coin for $0.00014, using either ETH, USDT or fiat currency.</p>
