<p>Last week the crypto climbed 23.70%, which is an indicator of the beginning of a consistent upward trend. RENQ declined 1.55% in the last 24 hours and was trading at $0.0067 at press time.</p>



<p>Therefore, if the demand surges abruptly, the Renq Finance asset price could bounce back from the current level. Then the next goal for the price could be to reach $0.01000 and in between resistance could be $0.008950.</p>



<p>Another possibility would be that if the RENQ crypto price fails to stay above the $0.005000 level, it could decline further.</p>

<p><em><strong>Koinly, is one of the most popular and user-friendly softwares allowing users to track transactions across hundreds of exchanges and digital wallets.</strong></em></p>



<p>Acceptance of cryptocurrency in different forms in different regions raised the need for a cryptocurrency tax calculator. Koinly, a crypto tax software thus introduced to the crypto universe to make crypto transactions and related activities effortless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Letâs uncover the facts and features linked to the respective crypto tax software.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Koinly?</strong></h2>



<p>Koinly was founded by Crispian Robinson, Maria Bilo, and Robin Singh in 2018 and is legally known as Koinly Pte Ltd. It is a platform that generates tax reports for crypto trading and similar activities automatically.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>In blending with all the key blockchains and exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, Bittrex, etc., the platform mitigated crypto tax reporting to a few minutes of work. It is emerging as one of the most popular cryptocurrency tax software solutions and is mainly developed to help crypto users calculate and report related taxes.</p>



<p>Easy import of trades, preview of capital gains, and download of tax documents enhanced the value of the platform among investors. It is one of the best software that solves all crypto tax-related issues effortlessly.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Koinly Features&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The cryptocurrency tax calculator and portfolio tracker hold a wide variety of features that make it an unbreakable part of the crypto universe.</p>



<ul>
<li>Individuals can track real-time crypto transactions as well as gains or losses.</li>



<li>The platform supports around 400 crypto exchanges, 20,000 crypto assets, 170+ blockchains, and wallets.</li>



<li>It supports a wide range of accounting methods including FIFO, LIFO, Highest Cost, Average Cost Basis, and more.</li>



<li>Integration with key tax software such as TurboTax and TaxAct is a significant feature.</li>



<li>User-friendly interface and tax reports for over 100 nations including the UK, US, Canada, and Australia.</li>



<li>Portfolio tracking, integration, data import, transaction monitoring, and crypto tax reports are major benefits of the software.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How the software resolved the crypto taxes problem</strong></h3>



<p>Since the day cryptocurrency was launched, <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/10/an-ultimate-guide-on-doge-killer-leash-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cryptocurrency </a>transactions become taxable in most of the developed and developing nations. Moreover, there are no appropriate rules and regulations to govern all the transactions as a digital asset is classified differently in different nations.Â </p>



<p>In some regions, crypto is classified as a property, whereas in some regions it is considered as maliciousness or intangible property. To resolve this issue and update with the latest crypto tax rules, Koinly was introduced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It helps in simplifying the crypto tax accountabilities through automated determination of tax implications and each transaction. It also helps in avoiding human errors and saves time in generating ready-to-sign tax reports.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does the platform work?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Registration: </strong>The very first step is registration in which the user can sign up for the platform using a Google account and additional details including country, desired plan, and base currency. The platform uses universal accountancy methods including First In First Out (FIFO), Last In First Out (LIFO), Highest Cost First Out (HIFO), and Average Cost Basis (ACB).</p>



<p><strong>Data Importation: </strong>Once registered over the platform, the next step is to link the crypto wallet, crypto exchange, and blockchains manually or automatically by entering API keys which are encrypted for security.</p>



<p><strong>Review and verification:</strong> after accomplishing the data importation the next step is review and verification. The step helps in ensuring that all the data has been imported accurately. Confirm the accuracy of the imported data. The platform doubles as a portfolio tracker, reviewing transactions, and establishing cost bases, market values, and profit calculations.</p>



<p><strong>Tax report generation: </strong>Once data is verified, detailed tax documents are ready for export. These reports are compatible with tax software like TurboTax and can be sent to accountants. The platform&#8217;s premium services include the creation of IRS-compliant documents such as Form 8949 and Schedule D.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pros and cons of the crypto tax software</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Advantages: </strong>Localized tax reports in around 20 countries and generic tax reports acceptability in approximately 100 countries is one of the main benefits of the respective platform. Another main benefit is the availability of the tool for free of cost and an easy user interface.</p>



<p>It supports around 20,000 crypto assets, 100+ wallets, 170+ blockchains, and 400+ exchanges which enhances its accessibility for investors. The platform detects duplicate transactions that should be excluded from tax reporting.</p>



<p><strong>Disadvantages: </strong>The platform is not 100% automated and a few of the transactions require manual input. A few of the users face errors when importing transaction history. Additionally, for RSI-compliant tax forms, the user needs to purchase the paid version which can be expensive for high-volume traders.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some Alternatives of Koinly</strong></h3>



<p>Although Koinly is one of the best platforms when it comes to crypto tax reports there are a few challenges. Here are a few of the alternatives users can explore:</p>



<p><strong>CoinLedger:</strong> It is another crypto tax software that aims to simplify the procedure of tracking transactions and tax reporting for digital assets. It supports over 400+ exchanges, and 10K+ transaction limits. IRS Form 8949 and International tax reports are supported by CoinLedger.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>CoinTracking: </strong>Another tool widely used for crypto tax reporting is CoinTracking which is the first and leading digital asset portfolio tracker and crypto tax calculator. It offers unlimited transaction limits, supports 70+ crypto exchanges, and works with IRS Form 8949 and International tax reports.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>Koinly, the crypto tax software makes it easy for investors to keep track of the activities and crypto transactions. The software is compatible with a wide variety of cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and blockchains which enhances its acceptability and accessibility. IRS Form 8949, Schedule D, and International tax reports are the main tax reports supported by the respective software.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FAQs</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is the software free to use?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The software offers a free version as well as a paid version. The free version holds limited features whereas the paid version offers a wide range of offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why use crypto tax software?</strong></h4>



<p>Operating with crypto taxes is complex due to the nature of actions that can have different tax implications and reporting needs. Crypto tax software thus helps in ensuring the accuracy and compliance related to the crypto transactions and actions.</p>

<p><em><strong>Coinbase did not hold back about a letter that contained information which was pushing the SEC to hold any more crypto ETFs.</strong></em></p>



<p>According to Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of Coinbase the direct evidence shows that Ether&#8217;s futures and spot markets are as correlated as Bitcoin. This letter suggests that the recent letter by the US senators urging the SEC to regulate Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, rejecting any further crypto ETF applications is misguided.</p>



<p>In response to a letter from two US senators urging the SEC to regulate Bitcoin ETFs even more and reject any further crypto ETF applications, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal criticized the senator&#8217;s claims.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Was in This Letter?</strong></h2>



<p>The letter, dated March 11, claimed that approving further crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin would expose investors to &#8220;enormous risks&#8221;. Grewal said that the senators&#8217; letter contained several falsehoods, and he argued that the evidence pointed in the opposite direction.</p>



<p>He explained that the market for many cryptocurrencies smaller than Bitcoin, notably Ether, demonstrated quality metrics that exceeded even the largest traded equities.</p>



<p>Grewal added that the spot market for Ether is deep and liquid, with only two S&amp;P 500 stocks having higher notional dollar trading volume. Additionally, there was direct evidence that Ether&#8217;s futures and spot markets were just as correlated as Bitcoin&#8217;s.</p>



<p>The letter from the senators, Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler, claimed that approving any further <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2022/11/04/crypto-winter-provoked-these-australian-crypto-etfs-delisting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto ETFs</a> by the Securities and Exchange Commission would see investors exposed to thinly traded markets rife with fraud and manipulation.Â </p>



<p>However, there are currently eight proposed spot Ether ETF applications awaiting approval by the SEC, and there have been hopes that other altcoins could eventually walk the same path.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Senators Urged the SEC to Hold the Approval&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The SEC has been urged by the senators to avoid setting a precedent for further approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns about the market&#8217;s recent weakness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, they argued that while Bitcoin&#8217;s market has undergone serious scrutiny, it is more reliable and established than the market for smaller cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The SEC is under pressure to scrutinize Bitcoin ETF brokers and advisors. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs is increasing political pressure on Gensler, making an Ether ETF approval in May less likely. Moreover, Both Butler and Reed have sponsored legislation to crackdown on cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to this, Coinbase and Grayscale met with SEC officials on March 9 to discuss a rule change for the launch of spot Ether ETFs. The SEC may reject pending ETH ETFs based on &#8220;correlation.&#8221; Some believe the SEC&#8217;s pushback on Ether ETFs is political, not intended to &#8220;protect investors.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>Coinbase has criticized a letter from Senators that claimed approving further crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin would expose investors to âenormous risksâ. Crypto industry pundit, Balchunas, said that the letter was evidence of mounting political pressure on Gensler, which makes an Ether ETF approval in May seem less likely.</p>

<p><em><strong><em>Over the past few years, cryptocurrencies&#8217; popularity has suddenly surged globally. Bitcoin is the only crypto dominating over 50% of the market. A major difference is seen post spot ETFs approval.</em></strong></em></p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the market pioneer, has most recently traded at its all-time high. However, the spike game was over in a few hours. When writing, it was trading at $67,983, with an intraday decline of 7.41%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BTC&#8217;s highest trading price is $73,750, achieved on March 14, 2024. The price at press time was 8.33% lesser.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2022/04/30/ripples-xrp-is-categorized-as-just-a-impostor-cryptocurrency-by-coinmarketcap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinMarketCap</a>, there are 42.09 Million addresses that hold $0- $1k Bitcoins. However, the number of wallets that hold $100k BTC is 683.61k.</p>



<p>Compared to other years in 2024, a significant boost has been observed in the total number of Bitcoin holders. As of March 12, 2024, there were 452.61k whales holdings, 1.70 Million Investors, and 17.51 Million retail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There has been a neck-to-neck competition between Binance and Coinbase for Bitcoin trading volume for the past few years. Binance is the highest Bitcoin trading volume contributor in spots, and Bitunix leads the perpetual trading of BTC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the past few years, a primary pump in the market capitalization of Bitcoin has been seen; when writing, it was $1.33 Trillion. Between March 13 and 14, the market cap of the most prominent crypto firm reached $1.44 Trillion.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reason Behind Downfall!</strong></h2>



<p>Despite an inflow of funds in the Bitcoin ecosystem from spot ETF, a significant outflow of funds has been observed in the past few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>BitMEX Research observed that the Grayscale spot ETF has suffered a severe outflow for the past few months. However, a record outflow of funds was seen on March 11, 2024, when Bitcoin peaked.</p>



<p>In the early days of approval, the spot ETF gathered significant attention, and billions of dollars were injected into the BTC ecosystem. Moreover, thousands of news addresses have started holding Bitcoin since January 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Quarterly Bitcoin Hashrate Report</strong></h2>



<p>The Bitcoin hash rate has surged significantly in the past three months and reached 780.17 EH/s on March 07, 2024. The record was one of the highest hashrate in one quarter.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/0zB09hnH1YV10L6Lj5WEj65Sx8mKyItdmEGPSOoC9ZBSvjmF2c_JIMywYKNFszQOWwIPW0ExXLI0gBWuLYKxdek4WdzusoPrkX-PWnRNNlqZi5CG3CqLDj7opvjUo_WUeRqTVPVdJ3tkfBea9MLLnzA" alt=" Bitcoin "/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Blockchain</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As per the whitepaper, Bitcoin&#8217;s hashrate is the calculated value that specifies an estimate of how much hashrate is being generated by Bitcoin miners trying to solve the pending Bitcoin block or any other block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In simple words, Bitcoin hashrate calculates the difficulty of solving an individual block. On February 26, a significant spike in the hash rate was seen when it suddenly reached above 700 EH/s from 631.2389 EH/s a day earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hashrate is measured in units Hash (H/s), KiloHash (kH/s), MegaHash(MH/s), GigaHash (GH/s), TeraHash (TH/s), PetaHash (PH/s), ExaHash (EH/s), ZettaHash (ZH/s) and YottaHash (YH/s) is the highest measurement unit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bitcoin hashrate was 544.97 EH/s as of writing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong><em>Berachain has emerged as a leading DeFi company in the past few quarters. Blockchain technology&#8217;s rapid evolution and advancement have lured global investors into supporting blockchain-backed companies.Â </em></strong></em></p>



<p>Berachain, a DeFi-focused, EVM-compatible Layer 1 built on the Cosmos SDK and proof of liquidity consensus, raised $69 Million in funding. The funding round was coâled by Brevan Howard Digital and Framework Ventures.</p>



<p>A Bloomberg report states that the project is raising money by offering digital tokens, which will be valued at $1.5 Billion. In the past few years, a significant shift of interest has been seen in funding crypto.</p>



<p>The report further states that Berachain is the only company that secured unicorn states during the ongoing bull run. Other than co-led in funding, OKX ventures, Robot Ventures, Shima Capital, Hack VC, Tribe Capital, and Polychain, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Other Major Funding Since January 2024</strong></h2>



<p>Since January 1, 2024, EigenLayer and Hashkey Group have only raised $100 Million. Optimism has secured $89 Million in funding, and Zama gathered $73 Million in a Series-A round.</p>



<p>Over this period, most projects that have received funding are based on the Ethereum blockchain. Portal, a DeFi project, has raised $34 Million in its seed funding round, followed by Ether(dot)Fi $27 Million.</p>



<p>The first quarter of 2024 is on the brink of being completed, and to date, over 351 founding rounds have occurred, and several companies collectively secured $2,005,891,315.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors Ranking Per Funding Rounds</strong></h3>



<p>OKX Ventures has invested in more than 32 companies in the past 180 days, and HashKey Capital has injected funds in 26 rounds. Big Brain Holdings and Foresight Ventures have participated in 22 funding rounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HashKey Capital has topped the list in making investments in the past 365 days as it is invested in 51 firms. Coinbase Ventures did not lock any major funding deals in YTD, but it has invested in 366 companies since its foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Market Price Update&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The fear and greed index of <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/03/13/stepn-gmt-and-digitoads-toads-predicted-to-reach-coinmarketcap-top-20-by-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinMarketCap</a> shows extreme greed, with 87 points, which might lead to bearishness in the market. The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies slips 6.47% over the past 24 hours.Â </p>



<p>Bitcoin, the market leader, marked a new all-time high at $73,750; the price failed to sustain higher for a longer time. As of writing, BTC was trading at $67,804, with an intraday decline of 6.83%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to several market analysts, the significant increase in the trading price in the past few days is due to the massive outflow from the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>Similarly, the second most talked about cryptocurrency in the market has declined approximately 6.30% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin SV tops the intraday loser list as its price slips 20.49%, Bonk (BONK) lost 16.26%, Injective (INJ) 16.26%, Mantle (MNT) 15.13% and Shiba Inu (SHIB) 13.36%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conflux (CFX) grew 8.02% in the past 24 hours, which makes it the leader of the past 24 hours gainers list, followed by Fetch.ai (FET) at 5.20%, Sei (SEI) at 3.27%, 0x Protocol (ZRX) at 3.17% and UNUS SED LEO (LEO) 1.59% including others.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Details to Look For When Investing In New Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>



<p>Understanding how to recognize new<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/02/28/5-top-cryptocurrencies-under-1-cent-to-grab-for-549-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> cryptocurrencies </a>that have the potential to result in higher returns is essential for your success as a digital asset trader. Crypto markets are generally highly volatile and unpredictable, so you should take everything with a grain of salt. That said, there are a few details or signs you should look for when trying to identify cryptos that are the most likely to explode after release.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Demand and Supply</strong></h3>



<p>The first rule of cryptocurrencies is demand and supply. The price of all cryptocurrencies is determined by two primary factors: availability and popularity. Bitcoin is an excellent example. When its demand spiked in 2017, Bitcoin went from $1 to $20,000 in less than 12 months. The same applies to any other cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limited supply combined with increased demand is what drives prices higher over time. If the two factors work together, the asset&#8217;s price can explode, resulting in exponential growth and high returns. Things work the other way around, so token prices will likely decrease significantly if the supply and demand are too high.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Technological Factors</strong></h3>



<p>Many cryptos gain value after providing more details on project development, including future roadmaps, updates, and partnerships with other projects. A significant increase in funding, an appearance on Tier 1 exchange listings, etc., can trigger explosive growth. Such information often sparks investor confidence, resulting in high gains in a short period.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Market Sentiment</strong></h3>



<p>Sometimes, the buzz surrounding a cryptocurrency can also result in high gains. For example, when Elon Musk Tweeted about Dogecoin in 2019, the token exploded almost immediately, resulting in a massive bull run. However, sometimes influencers use their social presence to manipulate market sentiment, resulting in artificial price increases that usually don&#8217;t last very long.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Regulatory Changes</strong></h3>



<p>Cryptocurrency markets are still largely unregulated, so new regulations and policies imposed by governments can also affect <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/01/25/link-whales-tired-of-lifting-token-prices-new-disclosures-might-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">token prices</a>. Rising interest rates and deteriorating macroeconomic parameters almost always negatively affect crypto prices. However, as the FED reduces interest rates, more investors are willing to invest in digital assets, resulting in steady price increases across the entire crypto market.&nbsp;</p>
