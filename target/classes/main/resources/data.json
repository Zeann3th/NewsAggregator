According to Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer of Coinbase the direct evidence shows that Ether\u2019s futures and spot markets are as correlated as Bitcoin. This letter suggests that the recent letter by the US senators urging the SEC to regulate Bitcoin ETFs. In addition, rejecting any further crypto ETF applications is misguided. In response to a letter from two US senators urging the SEC to regulate Bitcoin ETFs even more and reject any further crypto ETF applications, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal criticized the senator\u2019s claims. What Was in This Letter? The letter, dated March 11, claimed that approving further crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin would expose investors to \u201cenormous risks\u201d. Grewal said that the senators\u2019 letter contained several falsehoods, and he argued that the evidence pointed in the opposite direction. He explained that the market for many cryptocurrencies smaller than Bitcoin, notably Ether, demonstrated quality metrics that exceeded even the largest traded equities. Grewal added that the spot market for Ether is deep and liquid, with only two S&P 500 stocks having higher notional dollar trading volume. Additionally, there was direct evidence that Ether\u2019s futures and spot markets were just as correlated as Bitcoin\u2019s. The letter from the senators, Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler, claimed that approving any further crypto ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission would see investors exposed to thinly traded markets rife with fraud and manipulation. However, there are currently eight proposed spot Ether ETF applications awaiting approval by the SEC, and there have been hopes that other altcoins could eventually walk the same path. The Senators Urged the SEC to Hold the Approval The SEC has been urged by the senators to avoid setting a precedent for further approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns about the market\u2019s recent weakness. Moreover, they argued that while Bitcoin\u2019s market has undergone serious scrutiny, it is more reliable and established than the market for smaller cryptocurrencies. The SEC is under pressure to scrutinize Bitcoin ETF brokers and advisors. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs is increasing political pressure on Gensler, making an Ether ETF approval in May less likely. Moreover, Both Butler and Reed have sponsored legislation to crackdown on cryptocurrency. In addition to this, Coinbase and Grayscale met with SEC officials on March 9 to discuss a rule change for the launch of spot Ether ETFs. The SEC may reject pending ETH ETFs based on \u201ccorrelation.\u201d Some believe the SEC\u2019s pushback on Ether ETFs is political, not intended to \u201cprotect investors.\u201d Summary Coinbase has criticized a letter from Senators that claimed approving further crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin would expose investors to \u2018enormous risks\u2019. Crypto industry pundit, Balchunas, said that the letter was evidence of mounting political pressure on Gensler, which makes an Ether ETF approval in May seem less likely.

Compared to other years in 2024, a significant boost has been observed in the total number of Bitcoin holders. As of March 12, 2024, there were 452.61k whales holdings, 1.70 Million Investors, and 17.51 Million retail. There has been a neck-to-neck competition between Binance and Coinbase for Bitcoin trading volume for the past few years. Binance is the highest Bitcoin trading volume contributor in spots, and Bitunix leads the perpetual trading of BTC. In the past few years, a primary pump in the market capitalization of Bitcoin has been seen; when writing, it was $1.33 Trillion. Between March 13 and 14, the market cap of the most prominent crypto firm reached $1.44 Trillion. Reason Behind Downfall! Despite an inflow of funds in the Bitcoin ecosystem from spot ETF, a significant outflow of funds has been observed in the past few days. BitMEX Research observed that the Grayscale spot ETF has suffered a severe outflow for the past few months. However, a record outflow of funds was seen on March 11, 2024, when Bitcoin peaked. In the early days of approval, the spot ETF gathered significant attention, and billions of dollars were injected into the BTC ecosystem. Moreover, thousands of news addresses have started holding Bitcoin since January 2024. Quarterly Bitcoin Hashrate Report The Bitcoin hash rate has surged significantly in the past three months and reached 780.17 EH/s on March 07, 2024. The record was one of the highest hashrate in one quarter. Source: Blockchain As per the whitepaper, Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate is the calculated value that specifies an estimate of how much hashrate is being generated by Bitcoin miners trying to solve the pending Bitcoin block or any other block.

Beginners constantly look for low-cap platforms to invest in, hoping to acquire large amounts of tokens at a low price. This strategy has significant benefits and is less risky, but it\u2019s not entirely proven in any way, as many emerging cryptos often fail before the gains even begin. However, if a new platform gets enough backing from investors in the earliest stages and offers excellent utility, it can result in high short and long-term gains. That brings us to Green Bitcoin, an engaging new platform with a hugely successful presale event. >>>Buy The Best Coin Now<<< Green Bitcoin \u2013 Predict-to-Earn Staking Platform Showing Massive Potential Green Bitcoin is an upcoming cryptocurrency that has excited thousands of investors. It entered presale recently and is already showing clear signs of explosive growth. It\u2019s primarily a staking platform with a unique Predict-to-Earn reward system that allows users to earn native $GBTC tokens by predicting future Bitcoin prices. Its release will coincide with the next Bitcoin halving event, giving users another option to get higher returns during the upcoming bull run. Green Bitcoin is a gamified green staking platform with high sustainability, and it will be the next big crypto to explode in the upcoming period. It\u2019s built on the Ethereum blockchain, so it\u2019s compatible with all ETH-based crypto wallets. Earn $GBTC Tokens Using Your Gut Feeling The unique Predict-to-Earn reward system allows users to earn $GBTC tokens using their gut feeling regarding future Bitcoin prices. It\u2019s an excellent choice for beginners and experienced traders, as it offers a simple platform for earning tokens with or without trading experience. Once you buy $GBTC tokens during the ongoing presale, you can stake them to earn up to 118% returns before the first listing. After the platform goes live, you can earn even more tokens using various price prediction strategies and approaches. However, before you can place any predictions, you must stake a number of your $GBTC. Then, you have to wait until the staking period is over, and if your predictions are correct, you earn higher $GBTC returns. >>>Buy Green Bitcoin Now<<< Green Bitcoin Token Presale The platform entered presale a few weeks ago and has already raised over $4.3 million, showing clear signs of growing demand and a positive market sentiment. The platform has a total of 21 million tokens, but only 50% is available during the event. It\u2019s just a few weeks of going live, and considering that the presale hard cap is set to $7 million, you only have a few more days to get into the action early. Moreover, if you buy $GBTC tokens during the presale, you can stake them for up to 118% rewards before the first listings. Details to Look For When Investing In New Cryptocurrencies Understanding how to recognize new cryptocurrencies that have the potential to result in higher returns is essential for your success as a digital asset trader. Crypto markets are generally highly volatile and unpredictable, so you should take everything with a grain of salt. That said, there are a few details or signs you should look for when trying to identify cryptos that are the most likely to explode after release. 1. Demand and Supply The first rule of cryptocurrencies is demand and supply. The price of all cryptocurrencies is determined by two primary factors: availability and popularity. Bitcoin is an excellent example. When its demand spiked in 2017, Bitcoin went from $1 to $20,000 in less than 12 months. The same applies to any other cryptocurrency. Limited supply combined with increased demand is what drives prices higher over time. If the two factors work together, the asset\u2019s price can explode, resulting in exponential growth and high returns. Things work the other way around, so token prices will likely decrease significantly if the supply and demand are too high. >>>Buy The Best Coin Now<<< 2. Technological Factors Many cryptos gain value after providing more details on project development, including future roadmaps, updates, and partnerships with other projects. A significant increase in funding, an appearance on Tier 1 exchange listings, etc., can trigger explosive growth. Such information often sparks investor confidence, resulting in high gains in a short period. 3. Market Sentiment Sometimes, the buzz surrounding a cryptocurrency can also result in high gains. For example, when Elon Musk Tweeted about Dogecoin in 2019, the token exploded almost immediately, resulting in a massive bull run. However, sometimes influencers use their social presence to manipulate market sentiment, resulting in artificial price increases that usually don\u2019t last very long. 4. Regulatory Changes Cryptocurrency markets are still largely unregulated, so new regulations and policies imposed by governments can also affect token prices. Rising interest rates and deteriorating macroeconomic parameters almost always negatively affect crypto prices. However, as the FED reduces interest rates, more investors are willing to invest in digital assets, resulting in steady price increases across the entire crypto market. >>>Buy The Best Coin Now<<< Wrapping Up Green Bitcoin is getting more support by the day and is quickly rising above many other platforms going live in the next few months. It\u2019s one of the most anticipated cryptos in 2024, and the next platform will likely explode in the next few months. The demand for $GBTC tokens is growing exponentially, and it will go live right around the next crypto bull run following the upcoming Bitcoin halving event. Visit the official Green Bitcoin site and stake your $GBTC tokens for 118% rewards. Jump on the Green Bitcoin train early to get the highest returns in the next few months.

Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading in the $68,000s, down about 3.5% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), meanwhile, was last down about 4.2% over the same period and trading near $3,700. Both cryptos continue to trade with 30-day gains of over 30%, thanks mostly to huge spot Bitcoin ETF demand. But the ETF buyers were strong enough to hold up the market on Friday. More traders started taking profit in the latter half of the week thanks to the macro backdrop turning into a headwind. The DXY and US yields have pushed up this week as macro traders downsized bets on Fed rate cuts in wake of the latest CPI and PPI inflation figures. Some think that $74,000 may have been the pre-halving peak for Bitcoin. If the blue-chip markets are going to spend the next few weeks consolidating/falling, on-chain shitcoin markets all of a sudden become more attractive. On-chain markets refer to the market for digital assets that have been issued directly on top an existing blockchain. For example, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) token is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. These tokens can then be traded on decentralized exchanges, and also perhaps on centralized exchanges if they get big enough. They are often referred to as shitcoin markets because virtually anyone can issue a token at any time. As a result, these on-chain markets are replete with scams and pump-and-dump schemes. Here are a few of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be monitoring. Top Crypto Gainers Today on DEXScreener MindAI ($MDAI) An AI shitcoin called MindAI ($MDAI) is up 6,753% in the past 24 hours, as per DEXScreener. That makes it the top crypto gainer today on Ethereum. Its market cap was last around $1.2 million, with just over $250,000 in locked liquidity. Potential investors should be very cautious of this coin though, given five concerning aspects to its smart contract. These include; a modifiable tax, pausable transfers, a 5% buy and sell tax and a whitelist function. COCO ($COCO) A shitcoin called Coco is up 1,800% in the past 24 hours, as per DEXScreener, making it a top crypto gainer today. Its market cap was last $3 million, with $274,000 in locked liquidity. It also has no smart contract issues. But even if the token doesn\u2019t look like a scam, shitcoins are all still very risky. The token is probably still a pump-and-dump scam. There is no such thing as zero risk in the shitcoin market. Crypto Alternatives to Consider Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy. An innocent-looking project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower. A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is getting involved in crypto presales. The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price. These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing. While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales\u2014unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision\u2014savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more. With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market. Here are 14 of the presale projects with the highest potential.

Bitcoin (BTC) was last trading in the $68,000s, down about 3.5% in the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), meanwhile, was last down about 4.2% over the same period and trading near $3,700. Both cryptos continue to trade with 30-day gains of over 30%, thanks mostly to huge spot Bitcoin ETF demand. But the ETF buyers were strong enough to hold up the market on Friday. More traders started taking profit in the latter half of the week thanks to the macro backdrop turning into a headwind. The DXY and US yields have pushed up this week as macro traders downsized bets on Fed rate cuts in wake of the latest CPI and PPI inflation figures. Some think that $74,000 may have been the pre-halving peak for Bitcoin. That suggests it probably isn\u2019t one of the best crypto to buy today. But other altcoins have continued to pump. Here are some top performers that traders will be watching and could be the best crypto to buy today. Best Crypto to Buy Today Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter (JUP), Solana\u2019s biggest decentralized exchange, is pumping on Friday, having rallied 23.5% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. The token just hit fresh record highs above $1.2, giving it a market cap of $1.6 billion. It\u2019s fully diluted market cap is $12.17 billion. That\u2019s about $1 billion lower than Uniswap\u2019s fully diluted market cap, the most well-established of the DEXs. For reference, Uniswap\u2019s circulating market cap was last around $7.8 billion. The cryptocurrency hit a market cap $22.6 billion in 2021, so could easily 3x from here. Jupiter, as the Solana ecosystem leader, could see even larger gains. That\u2019s why it ranks as potentially the best crypto to buy today. Conflux (CFX) Conflux (CFX) is one of the top performers today, up 18.5% in 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. CFX has its sights set on challenging the early 2023 highs in the $0.49 area. If it can break above here, a quick surge towards late-2021 highs around $0.84 is on the cards. The prospect of near-term 2x upside means CFX could easily be the best crypto to buy today. Solana (SOL) In fitting with the pump in the token of its largest DEX, Solana (SOL) is also up big on Friday. SOL was last higher by about 7% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap. Last above $180, SOL is bearing down on its 2021 highs $260 region. Another 50% rally from current levels is easily possible for the token, ranking it as potentially the best crypto to buy today. Crypto Alternatives to Consider All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make solid gains. While the future is always uncertain in crypto, these names could be among the best crypto to buy today. However, those looking for a better probability of near-term gains should consider an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy\u2014getting involved in crypto presales. Presales offer investors a routine to get involved in a project at its very early stages, and thus potentially make returns of as much as 100x. If investors can identify projects with solid foundation, the risk/reward of their investment is very good. Analysts at Cryptonews spend a lot of time examining new presale projects. Here are 14 of the best presales of 2024, according to the team at Cryptonews: See the 14 Cryptocurrencies The post Best Crypto to Buy Today March 15 \u2013 Jupiter, Conflux, Solana appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_summary":"On a day that crypto markets succumb to profit-taking, investors are hunting for the best crypto to buy in order to benefit from the recent market dip.

The $5SCAPE token is currently priced at $0.00187 but will eventually list at a 434.76% price premium ($0.01) to this opening Stage 1 presale price. When Stage 1 finishes in two days\u2019 time, the presale price rises by 14.97% to $0.00215 in Stage 2. Eighty percent of the total token supply is available for purchase in the presale. The excitement around the project is shown by the size of the community on social media. 5thScape\u2019s Discord server already has more than 5,400 members, Telegram 16,588, X/Twitter 9,569 and 1,000-plus on its YouTube channel Tokenization to play a major role in the future of VR 5thScape believes that tokenization will play a major role in the future of VR/AR, and its $5SCAPE token is central to its vision. Users will be able to stake $5SCAPE to earn rewards and unlock a wealth of utility-rich features. A dynamic staking pool will be in part funded by player subscriptions and participation in virtual experiences. As more players are onboarded it grows the liquidity pool of the ecosystem to provide the basis for attractive and rewarding annual percentage yield from staking activities.For gamers, $5SCAPE is the universal currency for unlocking products and services in a seamless transactional environment, such as buying and trading in-game assets and access to premium content.On the other hand, for developers $5SCAPE tokens can be earned for building games for the platform and participation in the 5thScape Developer center.The initial product offering includes an impressive array of games, from MMA Cage Contest to soccer VR sporting fun Immersive Kickoff, racing game Thrust Hunter and Archery Master, an adventure game where you follow in the footsteps of a legendary archer. Interested parties can join the waitlist for all the games today. 5thScape chooses Ethereum for its superior technology and vibrant community 5thScape runs on the Ethereum network and will make use of the Skale Network Layer 2 technology to enable the scaling necessary for gaming and other virtual world activities.This is a smart choice. Transaction costs for Layer 2 technologies that run on top of Ethereum\u2019s blockchain are coming down following the Dencun upgrade, so ecosystems like 5thScape\u2019s will be beneficiaries.But with VR there is much more than just gaming. Virtual reality technology provides a platform for commerce that will break down the boundaries between industries and magnify the value potential of each. From movies to education, there are revolutionary opportunities open to those companies and projects that can harness the technology in a way that makes it appealing and accessible for all.The team at 5thScape has thought through how to overcome the barriers to adoption by developing its own hardware and through the innovative use of blockchain-based software. Tokenization plus VR Ultra headset and Swiftscape VR chair set 5thScape apart To work well, virtual reality and augmented reality need great hardware too. So the team at 5thScape will develop the VR Ultra headset and the Swiftscape VR chair in order to maximize comfort and ergonomics to deliver an immersive experience with precise motion tracking and intuitive controls. For all the power and technological innovation (and expense) of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro, much of that can be for naught if the experience of wearing and using the headset is so uncomfortable it limits the engagement with the device and enjoyment.The efforts of Meta in this field have certainly in many ways been pioneering \u2013 or at least the companies it has acquired have been. Meta\u2019s family of Quest headsets has helped to create a bridgehead for VR while Apple\u2019s mixed reality approach has literally opened the eyes of many to the possibilities, if not the wallets. VR is a chance for crypto-native agile tech companies to blossom But neither Meta nor Apple, or the other big tech companies, have shown any inclination to leverage the proven benefits of crypto as the foundation for a trustless economy that facilitates players\u2019 value interactions. That means nimble tech-savvy crypto-first innovators like 5thScape can carve out a niche for themselves and establish a competitive advantage.The funds being raised in the presale will enable the project to complete the development and manufacture of its hardware and build out the decentralized network infrastructure. 5thScape is audited by Coinsult and no major issues have been found with its code. Also, the project is fully KYC\u2019d by SolidProof; the team passed the KYC verification process on January 3, 2024. Also encouraging for potential investors, a link to CEO Anoj Kumar\u2019s LinkedIn is provided on the website, as are those of the rest of the leadership team.An active wallets widget on the homepage shows that there is purchasing activity from countries all over the world, such as Germany, Australia, the United States and Japan, to name a few. $5SPACE token can be bought today with ETH, MATIC, USDT, BNB or card.

This annual observance, established in 1987, emphasizes the profound contributions women have made to society. Diversity Drives Web3 Growth Monica Talán, Founder and Contributor at Spanish-language web3 platform CryptoConexión, told Cryptonews that raising awareness for women in web3 is not just about achieving gender balance. Rather, Talán believes that highlighting women in the web3 sector will expand the field\u2019s talent pool, leading to fresh perspectives and new approaches. \u201cThis will create more equitable economic opportunities, build inclusive communities, and ensure that the future of technology reflects and serves the needs of all,\u201d said Talán. This is critical, as 2023 data suggests that women hold about 26% of all jobs in the crypto industry. Statistics further show that only about 6% of the top leadership roles are held by women, with 94% of CEOs being male. According to Talán, women make up 47% of CryptoConexión\u2019s audience. She explained that by shifting the perspective from \u201cbelieving women must adapt to web3\u201d to \u201cunderstanding that web3 must evolve to embrace women\u201d has helped with the platform\u2019s diversity. Talán explained that CryptoConexión spotlighted 60 Latinas contributing to the web3 sector at the start of Women\u2019s History Month this year. \u201cThis list also included newcomers,\u201d said Talán. \u201cThis effort highlights the importance of representation, aiming to inspire more Latinas to join web3 and create a more inclusive, diverse digital future.\u201d Sandy Carter, COO at web3 domain platform Unstoppable Domains, told Cryptonews that women in the crypto sector have indeed innovated in unique ways. Carter shared that Unstoppable hosted a space on the X platform focused on \u201cthe power of tokenization and women\u201d on March 8 \u2013 International Women\u2019s Day. \u201cWe had guests like Dr Anino Emuwa, who founded 100 Women Davos, and The Africa Women CEO Network,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also had the Director from Boss Beauties who worked on the Mattel Barbie and Boss Beauty NFT project.\u201d Honored to be part of @UnstoppableWow3's initiative to empower women in #Web3 and #AI this International Women's Day.

Kim Currier, Head of Marketing at the Decentraland Foundation, told Cryptonews that from March 26-29, Decentraland will showcase the art of talented women during its second annual \u201cArt Week\u201d and \u201cMESHfair.\u201d \u201cMESHfair is a unique opportunity for artists to explore their creativity in a virtual environment,\u201d said Currier. Currier added that women artists will represent 16 of the 32 international artists selected to show new works during MESHfair. Image of MeshFAIR 2023. Source: MeshFAIR Artist and web3 producer Bay Backner founded MESHfair. Backner told Cryptonews that MESHfair acts as a way to connect artists working in the 3D file format for virtual reality (VR) with galleries and collectors. \u201cDespite widespread interest in VR, works in this format are still underrepresented in both traditional art fairs and influential NFT collections,\u201d said Backner. Backner added that 13.7% of living artists represented by galleries in Europe and North America are women. \u201cOf the 100 most expensive works ever sold, none have been made by a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there is still a long way to go towards gender equality in-real life art.\u201d Unfortunately, Backner believes that a similar gender gap is opening within the VR sector. This may be due to a lack of women-led Metaverse companies. According to McKinsey, only 10% of the virtual world or metaverse companies that gained funding during the 2017-2022 crypto boom were led by women. \u201cSo unless we work on discoverability here \u2013 sharing the work of women entrepreneurs and creatives in VR \u2013 we\u2019ll see the same tired old narratives being repeated,\u201d remarked Backner. With this in mind, Backner explained that MESHfair is important for discoverability. \u201cIt supports the small, but growing community of creators in immersive web3 technology. And every artist in this space right now is making history,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re defining a new artistic medium. It\u2019s therefore especially important that women artists are a documented and discoverable part of this conversation.\u201d A female artist by the name of \u201cJaneDAO\u201d told Cryptonews that displaying her work during MESHfair and Women\u2019s History Month provides a platform to inspire through sharing and creating. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to highlight the diverse creativity and insights women bring to these fields, reinforcing that art communicates universally powerful messages,\u201d she said. \u201cMy involvement not only showcases my contributions but also shines a light on the broader impact of women in this space, sparking important conversations about our shaping role in the future of tech and art.\u201d Image created by JaneDAO. Source: MeshFAIR Women in Web3 Continue to be Highlighted Even as Women\u2019s History Month comes to an end, women-focused initiatives will continue in hopes of encouraging women\u2019s participation in web3. Talán recognizes that the blockchain sector often presents a hurdle for women. She suggests focusing on simplifying web3 concepts and platforms, thus making the sector more approachable, as a key factor in changing the current dynamic. \u201cThe technical jargon, lack of easy-to-use platforms, and fast pace can be intimidating, especially in a field historically dominated by men,\u201d said Talán. \u201cDespite these challenges, significant progress is being made through dedicated ongoing efforts to onboard women into web3.\u201d For example, Talán explained that initiatives like SheFi, Unstoppable Women of web3, HER DAO, Black Women Blockchain Council, and the Association for Women in Crypto are key in demystifying the space. Each of these platforms offers continued education, resources, and community support. \u201cIn Latin America, \u2018WAGMI LATAM\u2019s\u2019 collaboration with communities like Cripto Curiosas, WomenBiz, WEDAO LATAM, WARMI, Mujeres en Crypto and Metagals have shown us the importance of creating local and regional inclusive environments,\u201d added Talán. Backner further noted that she will be hosting upcoming projects geared toward women this year. \u201cMy two upcoming projects are Decentraland Gaming Week (June 2024) which will support diverse creators to build interactive web3 games, and The Censored Art Show (Sept 2024) which will support digital artists impacted by censorship or shadowbanning on social media and other platforms,\u201d she said. Backner pointed out that censorship in particular is an issue that disproportionately affects women and minority digital artists. \u201cThis is especially the case if artists use their own bodies within their works,\u201d she said. Additionally, Carter shared that Unstoppable will continue its commitment to increasing women\u2019s involvement in web3 and tech in general. \u201cWe plan to expand our educational initiatives, offering more workshops, courses, and mentorship programs tailored for women,\u201d she said. \u201cNetworking events and safe spaces for discussions will continue to be a priority, ensuring women feel supported and connected.\u201d The post Web3 Community Celebrates Women\u2019s History Month in The Metaverse and Beyond appeared first on Cryptonews.","article_summary":"March has seen several web3 initiatives to recognize and spotlight women\u2019s achievements in celebration of Women\u2019s History Month.

Crypto Criminals Adopting Artificial Intelligence During a private video webinar viewed by Cryptonews on Thursday, Chainalysis Cybercrimes Research Lead Eric Jardine summarized growing and shrinking trends in illicit blockchain activity in 2023, and predicted what sorts of tactics criminals will adopt next. We\u2019re excited to announce that our 2024 Crypto Crime Report is now available! You can download your copy here. Want a preview first?

Formal audits have become something of a blockchain industry standard, though their success at preventing hacks is far from foolproof. With AI, however, there\u2019s no telling whether it will strengthen smart contacts or their attackers the most, and the balance of its benefits may oscillate over time. The absolute volume of stolen DeFi funds dropped from $3.1 billion in 2022 to $1.1 billion in 2023, with the number of incidents also falling from 273 to 172. Using Artificial Intelligence For Romance Scams Beyond its impact on DeFi, artificial intelligence could have worrying implications for romance scams, also known as \u201cpig butchering\u201d scams. These scams begin with seemingly innocent contact, evolving into a fabricated relationship that the scammer then exploits for financial gain. \u201cThat is an area where a large language model that has infinite patience and is quite creative could be used to devastating effect by illicit actors,\u201d Jardine added. Romance scammers in crypto nearly doubled their revenue last year compared to 2022, despite a decline in total scam volume from $6.5 billion to $4.6 billion. The average size of a romance payment is $4,593, though the average victim likely paid far more since such scams often involve multiple payments. As a share of all crypto transactions, illicit activity fell to just 0.34% of blockchain activity in 2023.

BTC began Friday\u2019s session above $71,000 before selling off sharply during Asian trading session. Having dropped to as low as $65,500 the Bitcoin price abruptly rallied back to $70,500 during US trading hours.

In past Bitcoin bull markets, the price commonly reversed around 30% lower from local highs. As recently as January, Bitcoin dipped from the at the time yearly high of around $49,000 to as low as $38,500. That suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s latest pullback potentially has legs. A retest of $50,000 isn\u2019t out of the question, based on historical comparisons. But ETFs may have changed the game. Major institutional investors entering the Bitcoin market for the first time, with the knowledge of its volatility but also potential upside, are likely to be less price sensitive than past cohorts of Bitcoin investors. They are also likely to have a \u201cbuy-the-dip\u201d mentality that may help cushion BTC price declines. Any BTC price dips now may struggle to extend beyond 10-15%. That suggests $60,000 could be a near-term price floor. The Bitcoin Price could dip to the low $60,000s, but could then fly higher towards $100,000.

Bloomberg reported that Marathon intends to purchase more mining sites in preparation for Bitcoin\u2019s halving event. The facility was built in 2023. Before this acquisition, Marathon served as a hosting client and had earlier used the site for a hosting agreement. Marathon will remain a hosting client at Applied Digital\u2019s North Dakota data center even after acquiring the Texas facility.

The partnership will see Together AI use Applied Digital\u2019s Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) for its operations. Many companies in the Bitcoin mining industry are now diversifying into the generative AI industry. Joining them is the Nasdaq-listed mining company, which is now set to also experiment with generative AI technologies. Marathon Digital\u2019s BitCoin Mining Exploits In late February, Marathon reported a self-mining hash rate of 28.7 exahashes per second (EH/s). With Bitcoin\u2019s next halving scheduled for April 20, the block reward is expected to decrease from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. To strengthen its position for this, Marathon has strategically bolstered its financial resources. As of January 31, Marathon possessed over $1 billion in unrestricted cash and bitcoin combined. Financial projections indicate this will propel the company\u2019s hash rate to a projected 50 EH/s by the end of 2025. Additionally, Marathon has made major moves to expand its mining capacity. In January, the company acquired two mining sites in Nebraska and Texas for approximately $179 million (390 MW). This latest acquisition of Applied Digital\u2019s Texas Bitcoin mining facility further solidifies Marathon\u2019s role as a major player in the digital asset mining industry.

Specifically, Bitcoin\u2019s allocation is 3.7 times greater than that of gold. Additionally, they pointed out a net inflow of $9 billion into Bitcoin ETFs since their inception, which offsets outflows from Grayscale. Crypto Market Surges 40% as Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attract $10 Billion Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director at JPMorgan, revealed that, when adjusted for volatility, Bitcoin allocation in investor portfolios now exceeds gold by 3.7 times. ❖ Bitcoin has already surpassed gold in investor portfolio allocation: JPMorgan JPMorgan managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said that, when adjusting for volatility, Bitcoin's allocation in investor portfolios has already outpaced that of gold. Specifically, the flagship\u2026 \u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) March 15, 2024 The analyst highlighted the accelerated inflows of over $10 billion into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since their approval in January and claimed the potential BTC ETF market size could reach $62 billion, using gold as a benchmark. Another report from JPM Securities predicts that the spot Bitcoin ETF market could expand to as much as $220 billion in the next two to three years, projecting a substantial impact on Bitcoin\u2019s price due to increased capital inflows. The approval of BTC ETFs has already positively affected the crypto market. In the past month, the total market capitalization soared by nearly 40% to $2.2 trillion. Bitcoin and Ethereum were the primary drivers, increasing by 45% and 47% respectively. Altcoins also benefited, experiencing double-digit gains, alongside further growth in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a notable increase in net sales, reaching $6.1 billion in February compared to $1.5 billion in January. On top of this, BTC surged by 31% in a month, reaching an all-time high of over $73,800 \u2013 a rise that coincided with inflows into spot BTC ETFs. Crypto mining stocks mirrored this trend, also reaching new record highs in February. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Expected to Grow: Analyst Projections See $62 Billion Market Within 3 Years Early this month, JPMorgan analysts estimated that only 7% ($230 billion) of the $3.3 trillion global investment in gold is held in funds, with the remaining portion stored in bars and coins. Drawing a parallel with the gold market, analysts applied a volatility ratio of 3.7 to project a potential size of $62 billion for the spot BTC ETF market within the next two to three years. This figure, however, might primarily reflect a shift of existing investments from other instruments towards ETFs rather than entirely new capital entering the market. Since their launch, spot Bitcoin ETFs (excluding Grayscale Bitcoin Trust) have already attracted $19 billion in cumulative inflows, representing nearly half of the $36 billion rotational shift anticipated by JPMorgan for the entirety of 2024. Accounting for the $10 billion outflow from GBTC, net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs remain at an impressive $9 billion. Notably, net sales for spot BTC ETFs also saw a significant climb, reaching $6.1 billion in February, compared to $1.5 billion in January. The largest daily inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETFs hit a peak of over $1 billion on March 12, with analysts speculating that this figure could rise further once outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF cease. Bears can't win this game until spot #Bitcoin ETF inflow stops. Last week, spot ETFs saw netflows of +30K BTC. Known entities like exchanges and miners hold around 3M BTC, including 1.5M BTC by US entities.

Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto-analytic firm CryptoQuant, foresees this development as fuel for increased demand. After a prolonged crypto winter lasting nearly three years, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has acted as a catalyst for BTC\u2019s renewed positive price action, propelling it beyond the all-time high of the last bull cycle, exceeding $69,000. This has also opened the doors to institutional adoption, led by the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock.

The commission has given big tech an April 3 deadline to provide documents and information to its requests. The European Commission issued the official request to big technological companies including Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, Google Search, Bing, Snapchat, and YouTube. European Commission Questions Big Techs over Generative AI\u2019s Hazards According to Bloomberg, this was conveyed in a formal request for information (RFI). The commission asked the companies to provide further information about hazards posed by generative AI. This is because the big tech companies allow users to create and spread content using the technology. The EU is most concerned about the precautions to mitigate the risks of generative AI to election voters, believing that the spread of viral deepfakes and automated service manipulation can impact voters\u2019 perceptions. There is now proposed legislation requiring gen AI companies to share details of their training data in the US, the EU and the UK. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a strong move in the right direction.

This decision follows the EU\u2019s recent e-commerce and online governance regulations \u2014 the Digital Services Act (DSA). This act classified eight platforms as Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs). In this light, it has mandated VLOPs to assess and manage systemic risks in addition to following other outlined guidelines. Meanwhile, election security is another area of concern that the commission is looking into as it seeks answers to the impact of generative AI on election processes. Other concerns include gender-based violence, distribution of illicit content, defense of fundamental rights, minors, as well as mental health. EU Moves Towards Election Security Rules The European Commission has been actively looking into the impact of AI on voters, even as the use of AI increases across all fields. A recent study showed the capacity of AI to spread misinformation among voters, for example. The EU is already counting down to March 27 to finalize election security regulations. The European body has been requesting feedback on election security statutes including by public consultations. This recent RFI to the big tech companies is considered a crucial request that will aid the creation of the EU\u2019s election security policy. Once created, the policy will help combat lingering election security challenges \u2013 including misinformation among voters.

This change in operation became effective on March 15 under Binance\u2019s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer, Richard Teng, who assumed the role four months ago. Binance Labs Severs Ties, Maintains Branding A disclaimer announcing the split was published on the website saying, \u201cBinance Labs is an independent venture and not part of the Binance Group nor is it involved in any of the businesses operated by the Binance Group (including but not limited to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange).\u201d Following the effect of this change in operation, personnel at Binance Labs now operate under separate employment agreements from Binance exchange staff. This is in line with the arrangements that are effective at the Binance-backed blockchain network, BNB Chain. In an unexpected move, #Binance has spun off its venture capital arm, Binance Labs, into an independent entity valued at $10 billion. This strategic decision aims to enhance operational efficiency and growth under the leadership of CEO Richard Teng. Despite the separation,\u2026 \u2014 Satoshi Talks (@Satoshi_Talks) March 15, 2024 Investment Director at Binance Labs, Alex Odagiu noted that they are no longer affiliated with the Binance group as well. He said this while clarifying that the venture capital entity would continue to use the Binance brand under a licensing agreement. Binance Labs has invested in over 250 projects since it launched. There are many companies in its portfolio that have been impacted by this transition into an independent firm. Some are industry giants like PancakeSwap, Polygon, Sky Mavis, and Curve DAO. Aptos Labs, LayerZero, and The Sandbox are some of the other companies involved. In February, Binance Labs invested in Babylon, a Bitcoin staking protocol that introduced the concept of native Bitcoin staking. The investment enables users to stake their Bitcoins on Proof-of-Stake blockchains and earn yields without relying on third-party custody. This bridges services, or token wrapping mechanisms. The unfolding events at Binance have been on the crypto community\u2019s radar since a November settlement with US authorities. The authorities charged Binance $4.3 billion and demanded that founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao step down. Despite its newfound independence, Binance Labs\u2019 core operations are expected to stay unaffected, with an emphasis on finding and investing in promising crypto projects. Venture Capital Trend Among Crypto Exchanges In 2018, Yi He, who heads Binance Labs and co-founded Binance alongside Zhao launched the venture capital division. As a venture capital and incubator, Binance Labs uses funds from the exchange\u2019s profits to back early-stage crypto projects. The splitting of these two entities does not appear to be a cause for major concern within the Binance ecosystem. Binance still holds the largest market share of centralized exchanges (CEXs), accounting for about 50% of global trading volume. The Binance native token, BNB, has experienced a slight decline since the news broke, however. At the time of reporting, BNB was trading at $584.31, representing a decrease of 2.81%. Aside from Binance, popular exchanges in the crypto industry, such as Coinbase, OKX, and Kraken have also established venture capital businesses. Coinbase Ventures was the second-most active investor in the crypto sector in 2023, according to data from PitchBook.

Sponge V1 made its debut during the bear market of May 2023, a fair launch token that instantly captivated meme coin virality due to its nostalgic and catchy namesake. In a dramatic climb, the first SPONGE token exploded to become on of the biggest meme coin launches of the year \u2013 hitting an all-time high market cap of over $100M and generating a community of more than 13,000 holders (and an additional 30,000 followers on social media). Much of these major price gains were fuelled by listings on more than 10 centralized exchanges, including LBank, Toobit, CoinW, BTCEX, Poloniex, MEXC, Gate.io, Bitget, BitKan, and BitMart. And this is why crypto whales are now betting big on SPONGE V2. Sponge V2 was not a traditional launch, to acquire this new token \u2013 early holders had two options \u2013 either buying SPONGE V1 and then staking it through the Sponge website, or, staking already held SPONGE V1. The SPONGE V2 airdrop saw tokens distributed based upon the quantity and length of time V1 tokens were staked.

At the time of writing, SPONGE V2 is currently trading at a market price of $0.003087 (representing a 24-hour change of -7.14%). This comes as price continues to wrestle with a minor -26% localized retracement move after rising to establish a new early-stage all-time high at $0.004240 on March 9. Now in consolidation, SPONGE V2 has established a well-defended lower support zone between $0.0027 and $0.0031 over the past week \u2013 priming price action for its next leg-up. Upside movements are now targeting a pushback above higher supper at $0.00365 as buy-pressure remains dominant over the past 24-hours representing 59% of transactions. Overall, price analysis leaves SPONGE V2 in a bullish ascendant trading channel in the weekend, with price primed for a bounce ahead of major exchange listings following a successful consolidation. Still representing a fantastic entry at $1.1m \u2013 if crypto whales are right \u2013 this project could undertake as much as a 100x return from current levels (based on historical market caps).

Broadly speaking, all leading meme coins share the same fate today, with market leaders Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and PEPE posting similar losses. Crypto\u2019s novelty coin sector is bearing the brunt of a broader market downturn that has today shaved 6% from market leader Bitcoin (BTC) which was trading at all-time highs earlier yesterday, but now sells at $68,118. Nearest contender Ethereum (ETH) also shed 5% overnight and changes hands at $3,711.54.

Source: TradingView WIF Memes Offer Less Utility Than VR Gaming Tokens WIF is pure meme stock, which makes it a volatile allocation for any portfolio. Meme coins are highly whimsical in nature and their pricing often exaggerates market trends. For instance, when Bitcoin was rallying last week, meme coins were rallying even harder. Today, when Bitcoin and Ethereum are posting losses, leading meme coins are posting heavier ones. Investors who want to support the altcoin sector should really limit their exposure to altcoins. Since their value is dictated by their viral appeal and trendiness rather than their underlying protocol, a sudden loss of interest could be disastrous for holders. Blockchain proponents believe that the future of gaming will incorporate blockchain tech to handle and record payments. Not only will blockchain be more integrated in gaming, it will also be more present in the wider web. Advocates of the idea refer to this iteration of the internet as Web 3. Another technology that will drive future innovations in gaming and the web is virtual reality (VR). With that in mind, it would seem that the crypto projects that are most ahead of the curve are VR gaming projects like 5th Scape ($5SCAPE).

NFPrompt Hit by Crypto Security Breach: Platform Takes Action to Secure User Assets NFPrompt acknowledged a \u201ccritical security incident\u201d on March 15 that allowed hackers to compromise several wallets and steal funds. This included unauthorized access to a portion of the platform\u2019s treasury and ecosystem fund, along with the wallets of NFP\u2019s contract administrators. ATTENTION $NFP Holders: We are writing to inform you of a critical security incident involving NFPrompt.

They illegally gained control of victims' funds,\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ZeQXLruvTW \u2014 NFP (@nfprompt) March 15, 2024 According to the platform\u2019s official statement, hackers managed to compromise several wallets, including those belonging to NFP\u2019s contract administrators, gaining unauthorized access to users\u2019 funds, including a portion of NFP\u2019s treasury and ecosystem fund. In response to the attack, NFPrompt took swift action to mitigate further losses. They swiftly transferred ownership of its smart contracts to new addresses, effectively isolating the hackers. While the platform assures that NFP tokens and other assets remain secure, the token\u2019s price has drastically dropped by over 15% within the last 24 hours. NFPrompt urges users to exercise caution and refrain from accepting NFPs from unreliable sources. Additionally, they advise solely trading the token on established centralized exchanges (CEXs) until further updates regarding the incident. Collaborative efforts are underway with partner CEXs to suspend NFP deposits while investigations proceed. NFPrompt has also requested that decentralized exchanges (DEXs) temporarily halt NFP liquidity pool activities. Specific CEXs have been notified to freeze transactions potentially linked to the hackers. According to its recent statement, NFPrompt has partnered with leading Web3 security firms SlowMist and Chainalysis. Notably, the platforms seek to monitor the hackers\u2019 on-chain activities and trace token swaps to reveal their identities and affiliates. NFPrompt Vows to Recover Stolen Funds, Works with FBI in Ongoing Investigation NFPrompt expressed its commitment to safeguarding user interests and stated that \u201cNFP tokens associated with the attackers will be identified and rendered unusable.\u201d The announcement further mentioned the involvement of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in assisting with apprehending the culprits. The NFPrompt team said that the FBI tracked down the hackers, and major CEXs were informed to freeze the funds related to the hackers. As of now, the exact amount of losses incurred by NFPrompt remains unclear. Launched in 2023, NFPrompt allows users to leverage AI tools to create unique artworks and claim ownership of their creations on the blockchain through NFTs. This one-of-a-kind approach attracted the attention of Binance Labs which selected NFPrompt along with 12 other projects in the sixth cohort of its incubation program in September 2023. NFPrompt, the first Web3 prompt artist platform, has received institutional seed investments at a $60 million valuation to push its mission of building the bridge between AI art and NFTs. By introducing a token that ties up the community, NFTs, and the value of masterfully imagined AI art, the NFP aligns all important metrics to build a widely adopted Web3 protocol for contemporary art and decentralized internet culture. The NFP token price has taken a hit following the security breach. According to CoinGecko data, the token has declined by 15.2% in the last 24 hours. NFP reached a high of $0.96 on March 14 before plummeting to an intraday low of $0.76 earlier today. While the current price stands at around $0.79, it remains 22% higher compared to the previous 30-day period.

Given that today\u2019s loss is largely the result of profit-taking from traders, PEPE has every chance of rebounding again soon enough.

New Meme Tokens Bring Greater Potential Given that PEPE is now a well-established coin, some traders may prefer to diversify into newer, smaller cap meme tokens, especially those on course to rally big as they list on new exchanges. This includes coins that have recently launched their own presales, with one of the most interesting in this category being new Ethereum-based meme token Dogecoin20 (DOGE20). It launched its presale only yesterday, yet it has already raised over $280,000, as it wins over more investors. #Dogecoin is a beloved token but has been limited in its potential future worth because it has an infinite supply that will always emit more #Tokens into the market. #DOGE20 fixes this with a fixed supply, allowing for unhindered upwards pressure on the token price. pic.twitter.com/MvnjTeVdhp \u2014 Dogecoin20 (@DOGE_COIN20) March 15, 2024 The reason why Dogecoin20 is so exciting is that it takes the basic appeal of meme coins such as DOGE and combines it with a bullish staking system, a hard-capped supply, and a commitment to supporting more venerable causes. As an Ethereum-based coin, it will enable staking, with its protocol providing greater rewards to holders who stake early and for longer periods. Another interesting facet is that it will regularly distribute a portion of its supply to charitable causes, as well as to projects based within its own community. The aim of this is to encourage greater engagement and commitment to its development, which in the long run can only help it grow. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that, unlike the infinitely inflationary Dogecoin, DOGE20 has limited itself to a max supply of 140 billion tokens. How is #Dogecoin20 different from #Dogecoin? $DOGE20 is part of the #DOGE family of #Memecoins but it adds more utility and value for holders by introducing staking on #Ethereum for passive rewards.

In combination, these features promise to give DOGE20 plenty of appeal, helping to push its price up over time. Investors can join its presale now by going to its official website, where they can buy 1 DOGE20 coin for $0.00014, using either ETH, USDT or fiat currency.

This bullish momentum was underpinned by a significant development in the form of an upgraded forecast for Wall Street earnings. As Bank of America revised its outlook on the US economy, highlighting the transformative impact of AI investments, the market witnessed a renewed wave of optimism, propelling stocks higher despite a backdrop of economic uncertainties. Stock market rally \u2013 Optimistic projections from Bank of America Bank of America\u2019s bullish stance on Wall Street earnings reverberated through the market, with the institution now forecasting S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) of $250 for the year 2024, marking a notable uptick from its previous estimate of $235. This upward revision, amounting to a 12% year-on-year increase, underscored the bank\u2019s confidence in the resilience and growth potential of the US economy. Notably, this upward trajectory in earnings forecasts coincided with the S&P 500 index\u2019s resurgence towards record levels, further fueling investor optimism. The rationale behind Bank of America\u2019s upgraded projections stemmed from a multifaceted analysis of economic dynamics. With the bank revising its annual GDP forecast for the year upwards to 2.7%, a marked improvement from earlier estimates, the stage was set for a robust earnings outlook. This upward revision in economic activity translated into a five-percentage-point enhancement in earnings growth, laying the groundwork for sustained market expansion. Also, the bank\u2019s forward-looking approach extended to 2025, with earnings forecasts pegged at $275, signaling a long-term bullish sentiment. Tech giants and AI investments Central to the buoyant market sentiment were the pivotal roles played by tech giants and their strategic investments. Bank of America highlighted the significant capital expenditure expected from hyperscalers such as Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc Class A, and Meta Platforms Inc Class A. With projections indicating a substantial year-on-year increase in spending, amounting to $180 billion, these tech behemoths emerged as key drivers of earnings growth. Importantly, this surge in capital expenditure mirrored an anticipated 80% of expected earnings growth, underpinning market confidence in sustained profitability. Beyond the immediate implications of increased spending, Bank of America emphasized the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) investments. These investments were projected to trigger a virtuous cycle across various sectors, with semiconductors and networking emerging as primary beneficiaries. Also, the ripple effects of AI-driven productivity gains were expected to permeate diverse industries, including electrification, utilities, and commodities. This optimistic outlook underscored the bank\u2019s conviction in the catalytic role of AI in driving sustained economic growth and market expansion. As the stock market rally gathers momentum, propelled by bullish forecasts and optimistic projections, one question looms large: Will this upward trajectory sustain amidst evolving economic dynamics and geopolitical uncertainties? Investors navigate a landscape characterized by optimism tempered with caution, mindful of the interplay between bullish forecasts and real-world challenges.

The Defense Department has high expectations for Plumb, anticipating her technical knowledge and strategic thinking will push the CDAO\u2019s innovative projects to new heights. Achievements and future directions Under Craig Martell\u2019s leadership, the CDAO has laid a strong foundation for AI and digital transformation within the Department of Defense (DOD). The formation of the CDAO itself was a strategic move, merging four key organizations to streamline data and AI operations. These efforts have aimed to enhance decision-making from the Pentagon\u2019s boardrooms to the battlefield. The Pentagon initiatives Martell\u2019s tenure saw the launch of five strategic initiatives focused on AI integration in fiscal year 2023. These included improving data quality and introducing better metrics for business performance. One of the standout achievements was the initiation of the Digital On-Demand service. This program partnered with MIT Horizon online platform to offer the DOD\u2019s military and civilian personnel access to cutting-edge learning resources on AI, 5G, and big data analytics. In conclusion, Radha Plumb is at the helm to accelerate the DOD\u2019s digital and AI capabilities. The transition reflects the Pentagon\u2019s ongoing commitment to integrating cutting-edge technologies to maintain its global defense leadership.","article_summary":"Discover the latest leadership shift at the Pentagon's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office.","creation_date":"Sat, 16 Mar 2024 01:45:00 +0000","associated_tags":["Trending News","AI","Defense","Pentagon","Tech"],"article_link":"https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-pentagon-appoints-a-new-ai-chief/","website_source":"cryptopolitan"},{"article_title":"How Miners Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the JPEG","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Colin Harper"},"article_detailed_content":"This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Inscription Issue\u201d.

Ordinals have been a polarizing phenomenon for most every subcommunity in Bitcoin \u2014 except for miners. The meteoric rise of the new Bitcoin-native NFT standard dominated discourse for months as Ordinals flooded blockspace and buoyed transaction fees to multiyear highs. According to critics, these transactions are, at worst, an attack on Bitcoin that tainted the sanctity of scarce blockspace; at best, they are shitcoins, the play-things of gamblers that belong on casino chains like Ethereum. Well, miners don\u2019t give a shit if they\u2019re shitcoins. They give a shit about making money, and Ordinals gave them a revenue boost at a time when mining income was at one of its lowest points ever. So many miners have embraced \u2014 or at the least, are ambivalent about \u2014 Ordinals/inscriptions, since they received a much-needed boost to Bitcoin mining profitability when many miners were nearly breakeven or unprofitable. Hashprice is a measure of the USD (or BTC) amount miners can expect to earn from a unit of hashrate (for example, at $80/PH/day, a miner with 1 petahash of mining rigs \u2014 roughly 10 new-gen ASICs like the S19j Pro, for example \u2014 can earn $80 per day). Given their positive impact on hashprice, Ordinals, a darkhorse technical advancement that few could have predicted last year, have found themselves at the center of discussions regarding Bitcoin mining economics, discussions that are more germane with each block that pulls us closer to Bitcoin\u2019s fourth block subsidy halving. Click the image above to subscribe! I\u2019m not writing this to proselytize anyone into becoming an Ordinals enjoooyer. I, for one, don\u2019t really understand the appeal. But I do think that they\u2019re important in the context of Bitcoin\u2019s ever-dwindling block subsidy, so they\u2019re worth studying to understand how they affect blockspace and mining economics \u2014 and what developments like them might mean in a future where miners subsist solely on transaction fees. WTF is an Ordinal, Anyway? In NFT parlance, folks use Ordinal and inscription interchangeably, but the individual terms refer to two different aspects of the NFT standard. An inscription is a piece of art or digital media, while an Ordinal is technically the number prescribed to an inscription to mark its place in the grand scheme of all other inscriptions. Another way to view it is that the inscription itself is the NFT, while the Ordinal is the number used to identify an individual inscription. The data for each inscription lives in the Segregated Witness section of a transaction. As such, unlike other NFT standards, the actual art, digital media, or data is uploaded directly to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Since the inscriptions are fully on-chain, you could argue that they are the purest form of NFT available as they benefit from the blockchain\u2019s immutability. Not All Inscriptions Are Created Equal When you understand that inscriptions are actual on-chain data, you can appreciate some of the critiques and concerns from detractors; if a bunch of NFT degens are inscribing monkey JPEGs and dickbutts and God-knows-what-else on-chain, then this crowds out economic (and potentially necessary) transactions. This concern was aggravated by the fact that the arbitrary data for each inscription benefits from a transaction fee discount. As a scalability measure, Bitcoin\u2019s Segregated Witness upgrade modified the transaction structure so that the witness data for a private key signature and public key was moved from the transaction hash field to another part of the block. Bitcoin discounts SegWit data, so it requires fewer satoshis per byte in transaction fees to transact. The arbitrary data for an inscription lives in the SegWit field of a transaction, so it\u2019s entitled to the SegWit discount. Cue the pitchforks. This discount is why, despite the first wave of image-based inscriptions clogging block space in February/March/April, transaction fees did not meaningfully increase; block sizes swelled when trendsetting inscribers flushed the blockchain with thousands of JPEGs for the first inscriptions collections, but these all benefited from SegWit\u2019s 4-to-1 data discount versus normal transactions. Perhaps intuitively, it wasn\u2019t until less data-heavy, text-based inscriptions from BRC-20 tokens became the most popular inscription type that transaction fees soared. So-called BRC-20s (a nod to Ethereum\u2019s own ERC-20 token standard) are a loose form of token. I say loose because they are really just Ordinals in a series defined by Bitcoin\u2019s OP_CODE function, where each \u201ctoken\u201d is itself an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token\u2019s place in the specific BRC-20 series. It goes like this: Someone (God only knows who) publishes an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token series\u2019 max supply, ticker, and the minting limit per transaction. Once publicized, anyone with the technical know-how can mint tokens in the series. These OP_CODE transactions do not benefit from SegWit\u2019s data discount, so they cost a pretty penny more than image-based inscriptions. But they also have a feature that image inscriptions don\u2019t: the minting function, which brings Ethereum NFT-esque incentives to collecting these inscriptions. Ethereum NFT series typically have minting contracts where anyone can create new NFTs in the series by interacting with the contract. This is part of \u2014 if not the entire \u2014 appeal. Minting an NFT is like opening up a digital pack of Pokémon/baseball/Magic: The Gathering cards \u2014 maybe there\u2019s a rare card in this next one! And while there isn\u2019t necessarily the opportunity to mint a rare BRC-20 (because they are all the same), there\u2019s the chance to mint a bunch of NFTs in a hot new series. Why anyone cares about having ORDI/CUMY/RATS #1 or #100 or whatever, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps it\u2019s the greatest expression of the greater fool theory yet in Bitcoin. But the fact is, they do, and the minting incentives for BRC-20s precipitated the largest wave of Bitcoin transaction activity ever. Through a combination of fee wars and the fact that these NFTs don\u2019t benefit from the SegWit discount, BRC-20s have catered a veritable fee feast for Bitcoin miners, but not exactly in the way you might think. Quantifying Transaction Fee Collateral Damage The bulk of transaction fee increases in 2023 has not come directly from fees associated with Ordinals; it has come from indirect fee pressure on other transactions. Per data from independent analyst Data Always\u2019 Dune dashboard, as of November 12, 2023, miners have raked in $70.3 million fees from Ordinals. Seems bigly, but it\u2019s only 19.4% of the $368.2 million in transaction fees that miners have earned in total since inscriptions debuted on December 14, 2022. To put this into further perspective, there have been 40.2 million inscription transactions, which equates to 30% of all transaction volume since December 14. So inscriptions have accounted for one-third of transaction volume over the last year but only one-fifth of all fees. As for the other fees, many of them are the result of indirect fee pressure from inscriptions \u2014 that is, fees that do not come directly from inscriptions themselves, but from the pressure that inscriptions exert on the average transaction fee needed to clear a Bitcoin transaction in a reasonable time frame. Galaxy Digital Research examines this dynamic in a report titled \u201cBitcoin Inscriptions & Ordinals: A Maturing Ecosystem\u201d. Rampant inscription activity congests the mempool. This is particularly true during BRC-20 minting events, as the first-come-first-mint incentivizes bidding wars as inscribers gun to be the first to mint a series. This raises the floor for average transaction fees and, as Galaxy Digital Research points out, precipitates transaction fee \u201coverpayment\u201d from various transactors. They define overpayment as any fee in a block that is greater than that block\u2019s median transaction fee. For normal transactions, this overpayment could come from transaction fee estimators in wallets or on exchanges or from general user ignorance regarding transaction fee structure and dynamics. Some users may also need to expedite transactions for any number of reasons, leading to overpayment. For inscription transactions, Galaxy Digital Research says that \u201cvoluntary overpayment\u201d was commonplace during times of high activity and popular inscription mints. This chart quantifies overpayment for inscription transactions and all other transactions to demonstrate the dynamics Galaxy Digital Research outlines in their report. When Bitcoin\u2019s mempool became backlogged in April and May \u2014 the hottest time frame for inscription activity so far \u2014 a majority of the transaction fees during this time actually came from user overpayment for financial transactions, not inscriptions themselves. These users could probably make it easier on themselves by not using built-in transaction fee estimators with their wallets and exchanges. Blessing and a Curse Inscriptions are a blessing and a curse. They\u2019re a godsend for miners, but they can be a pain in the ass for other Bitcoiners, particularly those who have to send transactions on the network every day. That said, blockspace is an open market. So I don\u2019t have to like Ordinals to recognize that it\u2019s not my place to police someone else\u2019s spending. Nor is it my place to censor a transaction that pays for blockspace on the f(r)ee market. That\u2019s part of the point of a permissionless blockchain, after all: to make transactions other people don\u2019t want you to make.

The company intends to use the proceeds to acquire more Bitcoin, as per their recent press release, following a strategy it has pursued since 2020. MicroStrategy announced it had priced the 0.875% convertible senior notes due 2031 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers. The notes will be sold at 100% of the principal amount with an annual interest rate of 0.875%, payable semiannually.

Holders can require MicroStrategy to repurchase the notes at 100% of the principal amount plus interest on September 15, 2028, or upon certain events constituting a fundamental change. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of MicroStrategy's class A common stock, or a combination of both at the company's discretion. MicroStrategy estimates the net proceeds of the offering will be approximately $515 million after fees and expenses. Led by founder and CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has been aggressive in its bitcoin accumulation strategy. The company now holds more than 200,000 bitcoins worth over $13 billion at press time. Saylor has said he aims to position MicroStrategy as the world's first \"Bitcoin development company,\" though details on the proposal have been scant. In the past, MicroStrategy has released alpha applications, such as a tool for allowing businesses to reward employees using Bitcoin lightning payments.

If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation, that He exists.\u201d - Blaise Pascal Blaise Pascal only lived to age 39 but became world-famous for many contributions in the fields of mathematics, physics, and theology. The above quote encapsulates Pascal\u2019s wager\u2014a philosophical argument for the Christian belief in the existence of God. The argument's conclusion states that a rational person should live as though God exists. Even if the probability is low, the reward is worth the risk. Pascal\u2019s wager as a justification for bitcoin? Yes, I\u2019m aware of the fallacies: false dichotomy, appeal to emotion, begging the question, etc. That is not the point. The point is that binary outcomes instigate extreme results, and the game theory of money suggests that it\u2019s a winner-take-all game. The Pascalian investor: A rational approach to bitcoin Humanity\u2019s adoption of \u201cthe best money over time\u201d mimics a series of binary outcomes\u2014A/B tests. Throughout history, inferior forms of money have faded as better alternatives emerged (see India\u2019s failed transition to a gold standard). And if bitcoin is trying to be the premier money of the future, it will either succeed or it won\u2019t. \u201cIf you ain\u2019t first, you\u2019re last.\u201d -Ricky Bobby, Talladega Nights, on which monies succeed over time. So, we can look at bitcoin success similarly to Pascal\u2019s wager\u2014let\u2019s call it Satoshi\u2019s wager. The translated points would go something like this: If you own bitcoin early and it becomes a globally valuable money, you gain immensely. 😀 If you own bitcoin and it fails, you\u2019ve lost that value. 😢 If you don\u2019t own bitcoin and it goes to zero, no pain and no gain. 😐 If you don\u2019t own bitcoin and it succeeds, you will have missed out on the significant financial revolution of our lifetimes and fall comparatively behind. 😡 If bitcoin is successful, it will be worth far more than it is today and have a massive impact on your financial future. If it fails, the losses are only limited to your exposure. The most that you could lose is the money that you invested. It is hypothetically possible that bitcoin could be worth 100x more than it is today, but it can only possibly lose 1x its value as it goes to zero. The concept we\u2019re discussing here is asymmetric upside - significant gains with relatively limited downside. In other words, the potential rewards of the investment outweigh the potential risks. Bitcoin offers an asymmetric upside that makes it a wise investment for most portfolios. Even a small allocation provides potential protection against extreme currency debasement. Salt, gasoline, and insurance \u201cDon\u2019t over salt your steak, pour too much gas on the fire, or buy too much insurance.\u201d A little bit goes a long way, and you can easily overdo it. The same applies when looking at bitcoin in the context of a financial plan. Bitcoin\u2019s asymmetric upside gives it \u201cinsurance-like\u201d qualities, and that insurance pays off very well in times of money printing. This was exemplified in 2020 when bitcoin's value increased over 300% in response to pandemic money printing, far outpacing stocks, gold, and bonds. Bitcoin offers a similar asymmetric upside today. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it resistant to inflationary debasement. In contrast, the dollar's purchasing power consistently declines through unrestrained money printing. History has shown that societies prefer money that is hard to inflate. If recent rampant inflation is uncontainable and the dollar system falters, bitcoin is well-positioned as a successor. This global monetary A/B test is still early, but given their respective sizes, a little bitcoin can go a long way. If it succeeds, early adopters will benefit enormously compared to latecomers. Of course, there are no guarantees, but the potential reward justifies reasonable exposure despite the risks. Let\u2019s imagine Nervous Nancy, an extremely conservative investor. She wants to invest but also take the least risk possible. She invests 100% of her money in short-term cash equivalents (short-term treasuries, money markets, CDs, maybe some cash in the coffee can). With this investment allocation, she\u2019s nearly certain to get her initial investment back and receive a modest amount of interest as a gain. However, she has no guarantees that the investment returned to her will purchase the same amount as it used to. Inflation and money printing cause each dollar to be able to purchase less and less over time. Depending on the severity of the inflation, it might not buy anything at all. In other words, she didn\u2019t lose any dollars, but the dollar lost purchasing power. Now, let\u2019s salt her portfolio with bitcoin. 99% short-term treasuries. 1% bitcoin. With a 1% allocation, if bitcoin goes to zero overnight, she\u2019ll have only lost a penny on the dollar, and her treasury interest will quickly fill the gap. Not at all catastrophic to her financial future. However, if the hypothetical hyperinflationary scenario from above plays out and bitcoin grows 100x in purchasing power, she\u2019s saved everything. Metaphorically, her entire dollar house burned down, and \u201cbitcoin insurance\u201d made her whole. Powerful. A little bitcoin salt goes a long way. (When protecting against the existing system, it\u2019s important to remember that you need to get your bitcoin out of the system. Keeping bitcoin on an exchange or with a counterparty will do you no good if that entity fails. If you view bitcoin as insurance, it\u2019s essential to keep your bitcoin in cold storage and hold your keys. Otherwise, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s insurance.) When all you have a hammer, everything looks like a\u2026 A construction joke: There are only three rules to construction: 1.) Always use the right tool for the job! 2.) A hammer is always the right tool! 3.) Anything can be a hammer! Yeah. That\u2019s what I thought, too. Slightly funny and mostly useless. But if you spend enough time swinging a hammer, you\u2019ll eventually realize it can be more than it first appears. Not everything is a nail. A hammer can tear down walls, break concrete, tap objects into place, and wiggle other things out. A hammer can create and destroy; it builds tall towers and humbles novice fingers. The use cases expand with the skill of the carpenter. Like hammers, bitcoin is a monetary tool. And a 1-5% allocator to the asset typically sees a \u201cspeculative insurance\u201d use case - valid. Bitcoin is speculative insurance, but it is not only speculative insurance. People invest and save in bitcoin for many different reasons. I\u2019ve seen people use bitcoin to pursue all of the following use cases: Hedging against a financial collapse (speculative insurance) Saving for family and future (long-term general savings and safety net) Growing a downpayment for a house (medium-term specific savings) Shooting for the moon in a manner equivalent to winning the lottery (gambling) Opting out of government-run, bank-controlled financial systems (financial optionality) Making a quick buck (short-term trading) Escaping a hostile country (wealth evacuation) Locking away wealth that can\u2019t be confiscated (wealth preservation) As a means to influence opinions and gain followers (social status) Fix the money and fix the world (mission and purpose) Keep this in mind when taking other people\u2019s financial advice. They are often playing a different game than you. They have different goals, upbringings, worldviews, family dynamics, and circumstances. Even though they might use the same hammer as you, it could be for a completely different job. Wrapping Up A massive allocation to bitcoin may seem crazy to some people, yet perfectly reasonable to others. The same goes for having a 1% allocation. But, given today\u2019s macroeconomic environment and bitcoin\u2019s trajectory, I find very few use cases where 0% bitcoin makes sense. By not owning bitcoin, you implicitly say that you are 100% certain it will fail and go to zero. Given its 14-year history so far, I\u2019d recommend reducing your confidence. Nobody is 100% right forever. A little salt goes a long way. Your financial plan may be riskier without bitcoin. Diversify accordingly. \u201cWe must learn our limits. We are all something, but none of us are everything.\u201d - Blaise Pascal. Contact Office: (208)-254-0142 408 South Eagle Rd.

By receiving an official blessing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an institutional investing barrier has been lifted. With this barrier gone, financial advisors, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies and retail investors can now receive Bitcoin exposure without hassling with direct custodianship. More importantly, a taint has been scrubbed off from Bitcoin, previously likened to \u201ctulip mania\u201d, \u201crat poison\u201d, or \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d. Following the unprecedented domino of crypto bankruptcies throughout 2022, Bitcoin price reverted to November 2020 level of $15.7k by the end of that year. After that great FUD reservoir was drained, Bitcoin slowly recovered during 2023 and entered 2024 at $45k level, first visited in February 2021. With the 4th Bitcoin halving ahead in April, and with ETFs setting new market dynamics, what should Bitcoin investors expect next? To determine that, one must understand how Bitcoin ETFs elevated BTC trading volume, effectively stabilizing Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility. Understanding Bitcoin ETFs and Market Dynamics Bitcoin itself represents the democratization of money. Not beholden to central authority like the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network of miners and algorithmically determined monetary policy ensures that its limited 21 million coin supply can\u2019t be tampered with. For BTC investors, this means they can be exposed to an asset that is not on an inherent trajectory of devaluation, which is in stark contrast to all existing fiat currencies in the world. This is the foundation for Bitcoin\u2019s perception of value. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) present another democratization pathway. The purpose of ETFs is to track an asset\u2019s price, represented by shares, and enable trading throughout the day unlike actively managed mutual funds. The ETFs\u2019 passive price tracking ensures lower fees, making it an accessible investment vehicle. Of course, it would be up to Bitcoin custodians like Coinbase to enact sufficient cloud security to instill investor confidence. In the ETF universe, Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated high demand for a decentralized asset that is resistant to centralized dilution. Altogether in the last 15 days, they have resulted in $29.3 billion trading volume against $14.9 billion pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC (GBTC). Image credit: Bloomberg Intelligence via James Seyffart This is not surprising. As Bitcoin price moved up due to Bitcoin ETF hype, 88% of all Bitcoin holders entered the profit zone in December 2023, eventually reaching 90% in February. In turn, GBTC investors were cashing out, placing a downward pressure worth $5.6 billion on Bitcoin price. Moreover, GBTC investors took advantage of lower fees from the newly approved Bitcoin ETFs, shifting funds from GBTC\u2019s relatively high 1.50% fee. At the end of the day, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the volume winner at 0.12% fee, which will go up to 0.25% after a 12-month waiver period. To place this in the context of the wider ETF universe, IBIT and FBTC managed to outpace iShares Climate Conscious & Transition MSCI USA ETF (USCL), launched in June 2023, within a month of trading. Image credit: Bloomberg Intelligence via Eric Balchunas This is particularly indicative given that Bitcoin\u2019s history is one of attacks coming from the sustainability direction. It bears reminding that Bitcoin price fell 12%, in May 2021, shortly after Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla no longer accepts BTC payments precisely due to eco concerns. During January, IBIT and FBTC found themselves at 8th and 10th place respectively as ETFs with the largest net asset inflows, headed by iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to Morning Star report. With daily ~10,000 BTC streaming into ETFs, this represents a greatly lopsided demand over ~900 BTC mined per day. Moving forward, as the GBTC outflow pressure wanes and inflow trend increases, the steady stream of funds into Bitcoin ETFs is poised to stabilize BTC price. The Mechanism of Stabilization With 90% of Bitcoin holders entering the profit zone, highest since October 2021, selloff pressures can come from many sources, institutional, miner and retail. The higher inflow trend in Bitcoin ETFs is the bulwark against it, especially heading into another hype event - 4th Bitcoin halving. Higher trading volumes generate higher liquidity, smoothing out price movements. That\u2019s because larger volumes between both buyers and sellers absorb temporary imbalances. During January, CoinShares\u2019 report showed $1.4 billion of Bitcoin inflows, together with $7.2 billion from newly issued US-based funds, against the GBTC outflows of $5.6 billion. At $1.4 billion, Bitcoin represents 96% of total flows in the US. Image credit: CoinShares In the meantime, large financial institutions are setting new liquidity baselines. As of February 6th, Fidelity Canada set up 1% Bitcoin allocation within its All-in-One Conservative ETF Fund. Given its \u201cconservative\u201d moniker, this signals even greater percentage allocations in future non-conservative funds. Ultimately, if Bitcoin taps into 1% of the $749.2 trillion market pool of various asset classes, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap could grow to $7.4 trillion, bringing Bitcoin price to $400k. Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap is within $0.85 - $0.9 billion range. Image credit: Blockware Solutions Given that Bitcoin ETFs provide a consistent and transparent market price reference point, large aggregated trades reduce market impact on potential selloffs coming from miners. This is visible from FalconX Research, showing a great uptick in daily aggregate volumes, previously from average 5% heading into the 10 - 13% range. In other words, the new Bitcoin ETF-induced market regime is reducing overall market volatility. So far, Bitcoin miners have been the main price-suppressing driver on the other side of the liquidity equation. In Bitfinex\u2019s latest weekly on-chain report, miner wallets were responsible for 10,200 BTC in outflows. This matches the aforementioned ~10,000 BTC inflows in Bitcoin ETFs, resulting in relatively stable price levels. As miners reinvest and upgrade mining rigs ahead of the 4th halving, another stabilizing mechanism could come into play - options. Although the SEC is yet to approve options on spot-traded BTC ETFs, this development will further expand ETF liquidity. After all, the greater spectrum of investing strategies revolving around hedging increases liquidity on both sides of the trade. As a forward-looking metric, implied volatility in options trading gauges market sentiment. But the greater market maturity that we will inevitably see following the introduction of BTC ETFs, we\u2019re more likely to see a more stabilized pricing of options and derivative contracts in general. Analyzing Inflows and Market Sentiment As of February 9th, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) holds 468,786 BTC. Over the last week, the BTC price went up 8.6% to $46.2k. Concurrent with the previous forecast, this means that BTC dumping is likely to spread out over multiple rallies ahead of the 4th halving and beyond. By latest numbers provided by Farside Investors, as of February 8th, Bitcoin ETFs have racked up $403 million inflows, totaling to $2.1 billion. GBTC outflows totaled $6.3 billion. Image credit: Farside Investors From January 11th to February 8th, GBTC outflows have steadily decreased. Within the first week, they averaged $492 million. In the second week, GBTC outflows averaged $313 million, ending in $115 million on average during the third week. Source: Farside Investors, image credit: Bitcoin Magazine On a weekly basis, this represents a 36% reduction on sell pressure from week one to two, and 63% reduction from week two to three. As GBTC FUD unfolded up to February 9th, crypto fear & greed index elevated to \u201cgreed\u201d at 72 points. This represents a revisit to January 12th, at 71 points, just a few days after Bitcoin ETF approvals. Looking ahead, it bears noticing that Bitcoin price is reliant on global liquidity. After all, it was the Fed\u2019s interest rate hiking cycle in March 2022 that caused the avalanche of crypto bankruptcies, culminating in the FTX collapse. Current fed fund futures project the end of that cycle either in May or in June. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that the Federal Reserve will veer off the money printing course. And at such occasions, Bitcoin price followed suit. M2 money supply measures how much money is available in an economy. Image credit: LookIntoBitcoin.com Considering the insurmountable national debt of $34 trillion, while the federal spending keeps outpacing revenue, Bitcoin is positioning itself as a safe haven asset. One that waits for capital inflows into its limited 21 million coin supply. Historical Context and Future Implications As a similar safe haven asset, Gold Bullion Securities (GBS) launched as the first gold ETF in March 2003 on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Next year, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) launched on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Within a week from November 18th, 2004, GLD\u2019s total net assets rose up from $114,920,000 to $1,456,602,906. By the end of December, this decreased to $1,327,960,347. To reach BlackRock\u2019s IBIT market value of $3.5 billion, it took GLD up to November 22nd 2005. Although not inflation-adjusted, this indicates Bitcoin\u2019s superior market sentiment compared to gold. Bitcoin is digital, yet it is grounded in a proof-of-work mining network spanning the globe. Its digital nature translates to portability which can not be said of gold. The USG showcased this point when President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102 in 1933 for citizens to sell their gold bullions. Likewise, new gold veins are frequently discovered which dampens its limited supply status in contrast to Bitcoin. In addition to these fundamentals, Bitcoin ETF options are yet to materialize. Nonetheless, Standard Chartered analysts project $50 to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Moreover, large companies are yet to follow MicroStrategy\u2019s lead by effectively converting shares sales into a depreciating asset. Even 1% BTC allocations across mutual funds are poised to skyrocket BTC price. Case in point, Advisors Preferred Trust set up a 15% range allocation into indirect Bitcoin exposure via futures contracts and BTC ETFs. Conclusion After 15 years of doubt and aspersions, Bitcoin has reached the apex of credibility. The first wave of believers in sound money ensured that the blockchain version of it is not lost in the bin of coding history. On the back of their confidence, up until now, Bitcoin investors constituted the second wave. The Bitcoin ETF milestone represents the third wave exposure milestone. Central banks around the world continue to erode confidence in money, as governments cannot help themselves but to indulge in spending. With so much noise introduced into the exchange of value, Bitcoin represents a return to the sound money root. Its saving grace is digital, but also physical proof-of-work as energy. Barring extreme USG action to sabotage institutional exposure, Bitcoin could even overtake gold as a traditional safe haven asset. This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.

The judge promised to provide detailed reasons for his decision at a later date. The trial unfolded amidst ongoing legal battles between Wright and COPA, with Wright issuing a settlement offer to the alliance and other involved parties.

However, COPA rejected the offer, emphasizing that it would imply acceptance of Wright's self-proclaimed identity as Satoshi Nakamoto. Moreover, COPA presented new forensic evidence during the trial to discredit Wright's claim, including the discovery of a Chat GPT forgery by Wright, suggesting that the evidence he presented was fabricated.

In a recent interview, Back explained his bullish perspective on Bitcoin's potential. \"I think it's kind of overdue already,\" he said about Bitcoin reaching a six-figure valuation. \"Bitcoin has been performing quite well, and many new applications like Strike have come online, providing easy user interfaces. The fundamentals and price have diverged somewhat, so I think the price will catch up.\" Back doubled down on his $100,000 prediction in a post on X saying, \"I think the reason things are muted is that $100k seems way overdue, for a few years now.

When talking about fiat currencies, debasement traditionally refers to the practice of reducing the precious metal content in coins while keeping their nominal value the same, thereby diluting the coin\u2019s intrinsic worth. In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency \u2014 such as when central banks increase the supply of money, in the process lowering the nominal value of each unit. UNDERSTANDING DEBASEMENT Before paper money and coins made of cheap metals like nickel, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver. These were the most sought after metals of the time, giving them value beyond government decree. Debasement was a common practice to save on precious metals and use them in a mix of lower-value metals instead. This practice of mixing the precious metals with a lower-quality metal means authorities could create additional coins with the same face value, expanding the money supply for a fraction of the cost compared to coins with more gold and silver content. Today, coins and notes don't have inherent worth, they are simply tokens that represent value. This means debasement relies on supply: i.e. how many coins or notes the issuing body allows to circulate. Debasement went through different processes and methods over time; therefore, we can define old and new methods. TRADITIONAL METHOD Coin clipping, sweating, and plugging were the most common debasement processes used until the introduction of paper money. Such methods were employed both by malicious actors that counterfeited coins and by authorities that increased the number of coins in circulation. Clipping involves \u201cshaving\u201d the coins\u2019 edges to remove some of the metal. As with sweating, the resulting clipped bits would be collected and used to make new counterfeit coins. Sweating involves shaking coins vigorously in a bag until the edges of the coins come off and lay at the bottom. The pieces are then collected and used to create new coins. Plugging was a way of punching a hole out of the coin\u2019s middle area with the rest of the coin hammered together to close the gap. It could also be sawn in half with a plug of metal extracted from the interior. After filling the hole with a cheaper metal, the two halves would be fused again. MODERN-DAY METHODS Money supply increase is the modern method used by governments to debase the currency. By printing more money, governments get more funds to spend but it results in inflation for its citizens. Currency can be debased by increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, or implementing other measures that encourage inflation; they\u2019re all \u201cgood\u201d ways of reducing the value of a currency. WHY IS MONEY DEBASED? Governments debase their currency so that they can spend without raising further taxes. Debasing money to fund wars was an effective way of increasing the money supply to engage in expensive conflicts without affecting people\u2019s finances \u2014 or so it is believed. Whether by traditional debasement or modern money printing, money supply increases have short-sighted benefits in boosting the economy. But in the long term, it leads to inflation and financial crises. The effects of this are felt most acutely by those in society who do not own hard assets that might counter the loss in the currency\u2019s value. Currency debasement could also occur by malicious actors who introduce counterfeit coins to an economy, but the consequence of being caught can in some countries lead to a death sentence. \u201cInflation is legal counterfeiting, Counterfeiting is illegal inflation.\u201d - Robert Breedlove Governments can take some measures to mitigate risks associated with money debasement and prevent unstable and weak economies, for example by controlling the money supply and interest rates within a specific range, managing spending, and avoiding excessive borrowing. Any economic reform that promotes productivity and attracts foreign investments helps maintain confidence in the currency and prevent money debasement. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES The Roman Empire The first example of currency debasement dates back to the Roman Empire under emperor Nero around 60 A.D. Nero reduced the silver content in the denarius coins from 100% to 90% during his tenure. Emperor Vespasian and his son Titus had enormous expenditures via post-civil war reconstruction projects like the building of the Colosseum, compensation to the victims of the Vesuvius eruption, and the Great Fire of Rome in 64 A.D. The chosen means to survive the financial crisis was to reduce the silver content of the \u201cdenarius\u201d from 94% to 90%. Titus\u2019 brother and successor, Domitian, saw enough value in \u201chard money\u201d and the stability of a credible money supply that he increased the silver content of the denarius back to 98% \u2014 a decision he had to revert when another war broke out, and inflation was looming again across the empire. This process gradually continued until the silver content measured just 5% in the following centuries. The Empire began to experience severe financial crises and inflation as the money continued to be devalued \u2014 particularly during the 3rd century A.D., sometimes referred to as the \u201cCrisis of the Third Century.\u201d During this period, spanning from about A.D. 235 to A.D. 284, Romans demanded higher wages and an increase in the price of the goods they were selling to face currency depreciation. The era was marked by political instability, external pressures from barbarian invasions, and internal issues such as economic decline and plague. It was only when Emperor Diocletian and later Constantine took various measures, including introducing new coinage and implementing price controls, that the Roman economy began to stabilize. However, these events highlighted the vulnerabilities of the once-mighty Roman economic system. Read More >> Hard To Soft Money: The Hyperinflation Of The Roman Empire OTTOMAN EMPIRE During the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman official monetary unit, the akçe, was a silver coin that went through consistent debasement from 0.85 grams contained in a coin in the 15th century down to 0.048 grams in the 19th century. The measure to lower the intrinsic value of the coinage was taken to make more coins and increase the money supply. New currencies, the kuruş in 1688 and then the lira in 1844, gradually replaced the original official akçe due to its continuous debasement. HENRY VIII Under Henry VIII, England needed more money, so his chancellor started to debase the coins using cheaper metals like copper in the mix to make more coins for a more affordable cost. At the end of his reign, the silver content of the coins went down from 92.5% to only 25% as a way to make more money and fund the heavy military expenses the current European war was demanding. WEIMAR REPUBLIC During the Weimar Republic of the 1920s, the German government met its war and post-war financial obligations by printing more money. The measure reduced the mark\u2019s value from around eight marks per dollar to 184. By 1922, the mark had depreciated to 7,350, eventually collapsing in a painful hyperinflation when it reached 4.2 trillion marks per USD. History offers us poignant reminders of the perils of monetary expansion. These once-powerful empires all serve as cautionary tales for the modern fiat system. As these empires expanded their money supply, devaluing their currencies, they were, in many ways, like the proverbial lobster in boiling water. The temperature \u2014 or in this case, the rate of monetary debasement \u2014 increased so gradually that they failed to recognize the impending danger until it was too late. Just as a lobster doesn't appear to realize it\u2019s being boiled alive if the water\u2019s temperature rises slowly, these empires didn\u2019t grasp the full extent of their economic vulnerabilities until their systems became untenable. The gradual erosion of their monetary value was not just an economic issue; it was a symptom of deeper systemic problems, signaling the waning strength of once-mighty empires. DEBASEMENT IN THE MODERN ERA The dissolution of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s marked a pivotal moment in global economic history. Established in the mid-20th century, the Bretton Woods system had loosely tethered major world currencies to the U.S. dollar, which itself was backed by gold, ensuring a degree of economic stability and predictability. However, its dissolution effectively untethered money from its golden roots. This shift granted central bankers and politicians greater flexibility and discretion in monetary policy, allowing for more aggressive interventions in economies. While this newfound freedom offered tools to address short-term economic challenges, it also opened the door to misuse and a gradual weakening of the economy. In the wake of this monumental change, the US has experienced significant alterations in its monetary policy and money supply. By 2023, the monetary base had surged to 5.6 trillion dollars, representing an approximate 69-fold growth from its level of 81.2 billion dollars in 1971. As we reflect on the modern era and the significant changes in U.S. monetary policy, it\u2019s crucial to heed these historical lessons. Continuous debasement and unchecked monetary expansion can only go on for so long before the system reaches a breaking point. EFFECTS OF DEBASEMENT Currency debasement can have several significant effects on an economy, varying in magnitude depending on the extent of debasement and the underlying economic conditions. Here are some of the most impactful consequences that currency debasement can generate over the long term. Higher inflation rates Higher inflation rates are the most immediate and impactful effects of currency debasement. As the currency\u2019s value decreases, it takes more units to purchase the same goods and services, eroding the purchasing power of money. Increasing Interest Rates Central banks may respond to currency debasement and rising inflation by increasing interest rates, which can impact borrowing costs, business investments, and consumer spending patterns. Deteriorating the Value of Savings Currency debasement can deteriorate the value of savings held in the domestic currency. This is particularly detrimental to individuals with fixed-income assets, such as retirees who rely on pensions or interest income. More Expensive Imports A debased currency can make imports more expensive, potentially leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers reliant on foreign goods. However, it may also make exports more competitive internationally, as foreign buyers can purchase domestic goods at a lower price. Undermining Public Confidence in the Economy Continuous currency debasement can undermine public confidence in the domestic currency and the government\u2019s ability to manage the economy effectively. This loss of trust may further exacerbate economic instability and even hyperinflation. SOLUTION TO DEBASEMENT The solution to debasement lies in the reintroduction of sound money \u2014 money whose supply cannot be easily manipulated. While many nostalgically yearn for a return to the gold standard, which was arguably superior to contemporary systems, it is not the ultimate solution. The reason lies in the centralization of gold by central banks. Should we revert to a gold standard, history would likely repeat itself, leading to confiscation and the debasement of currencies once again. Put simply, if a currency can be debased, it will be. How Bitcoin Avoids Debasement Bitcoin offers a permanent solution to this issue. Its supply is capped at 21 million, a number that is hard-coded and safeguarded by proof-of-work mining and a decentralized network of nodes. Thanks to its decentralized nature, no single entity or government can control Bitcoin\u2019s issuance or governance. Furthermore, its inherent scarcity makes it resilient to the inflationary pressures that are typically seen with traditional fiat currencies. As a distributed system, Bitcoin users can ensure that the supply never deviates from the predetermined supply cap by running the software that downloads and validates the entire transactional ledger. By verifying every transaction in Bitcoin\u2019s history, where every coin came from and where it went, users can be absolutely sure that the supply has not been debased and no coins were created that should not have been. Full node software like this for Bitcoin is essentially a counterfeiting detection machine that anyone can run. It guarantees the supply is intact, that coins being spent were properly authorized, and no funny business is happening. Any Bitcoin wallet software can also ensure that no one can restrict your access to your own money. In times of economic uncertainty, or when central banks engage in extensive money printing, investors often turn to assets like gold and bitcoin for their store-of-value properties. As time progresses, there\u2019s potential for people to recognize Bitcoin not just as a store of value, but as the next evolution of money.","article_summary":"Bitcoin has been touted as the solution to monetary debasement, but what is debasement really, and where does it come from?

Using only the first four letters of the BIP39 seed words, a 12-word seed phrase can be stored in a mere 48 nucleotides of DNA. (For comparison, the average gene is several thousand nucleotides long, and the complete human genome contains over 3 billion nucleotides). Any genetics graduate student could, in just a few days, turn my seed word sequence into an actual strand of DNA and insert that DNA into E. coli or some other suitable host for storage (and propagation) inside a living organism. DNA is just one modality for storing and transmitting information. There are numerous other ways to do so and once information is widely distributed it is nearly impossible to extinguish, which is why it will be impossible to stop Bitcoin on a global scale with regulation, legislation, or even violence. The mere fact that you can store a bitcoin private key in DNA demonstrates the futility of attempting to ban Bitcoin. Once unleashed, information is hard to contain. But why is information so hard to contain? Perhaps because information is a fundamental entity of the universe. For centuries scientists thought the universe was made only of matter and energy. Today, we know it is made of matter, energy, and information. Information can be stored in matter and transmitted using energy, but information itself is neither. Einstein showed us that matter and energy are interchangeable (E=mc2) but in toto cannot be created nor destroyed. By contrast, information can be created and destroyed, but neither is easy. And once information is created and widely distributed, it is increasingly difficult to destroy. The Parts of Information Information is meant to be sent and received between two or more parties. It is done with a purpose by the sender and is meant to spur action in the receiver. There are five hierarchical components to information: Fidelity Syntax (code or grammar) Semantics (meaning) Pragmatics (action) Apobetics (purpose) Fidelity Fidelity is the lowest element of information, but it is absolutely necessary for successful transmission. It was once a major issue for cell phone and internet communication. Remember the \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d commercial? With technical advancements, low fidelity eventually became high fidelity (which weirdly became wireless fidelity, or Wi-Fi). Generally, we are not concerned with fidelity unless it is lacking. (Can you hear me now?) The Code and Language Syntax refers to the code or grammar used for transmitting information. A code is a set of symbols that represent temporally or spatially interconnectable bits of information. That is, symbols can be strung together in time or space to achieve the next level of information (semantics). The symbols used can vary tremendously. They include, among other things, the letters that make up an alphabet, hand gestures (e.g., American Sign Language), musical notes (e.g., those old modem connections and touch tone phones), or the nucleotides in DNA and RNA. The number of symbols used can vary, as well. Most alphabets use 20-35 letters, the nucleotide code uses four chemicals (abbreviated A, U, C, and G), and the binary code employed by computers has just two symbols (0 and 1) representing the on and off states. The number and type of symbols employed are not selected randomly. For instance, they may be determined by the mode of transmission or to meet a specific need (Table 1). Table 1: Symbols may be chosen for mode of transmission or to meet a specific need. A common code is essential for information to be successfully communicated. That is, the code must be known to both the sender and the receiver. Also, because the code is not itself the information but merely the purveyor of information, any particular code can be translated to any other code. For example, written human languages can be translated from one to another: Go tell it on the mountain\u2026 Va le dire sur la montagne\u2026 Ve a contario en la montaña\u2026 The above phrase can also be translated, using human eyes, brain, and mouth, from symbols on a page into sound waves (acoustic symbols) in the air, which can be picked up by a microphone and converted to electrical signals in wires and then to radio waves transmitted through space to be picked up by an antenna on the space station, turned back into electrical signals, and then converted by a speaker back into sound waves to be heard by the ears of another human. In the ears of our human astronaut, the signal is converted from waves of air to waves of fluid in the cochlea and then to electrical nerve impulses carried to the brain to be interpreted by neurons. In the brain, those neurons somehow make sense of the original string of symbols, which brings us to the next level of information: semantics or meaning. Semantics, Pragmatics, and Apobetics Semantics is the meaning or intent of a message (a string of symbols). The allocation of meaning to symbols is a mental process. This doesn\u2019t happen at the machine level but at the human level. When you read a book, you are not interested in fidelity (unless it is lacking) or syntax (unless the grammar is horrible or it\u2019s a language you do not understand). Instead, you are interested in the meaning conveyed by the message, i.e., the semantics. Although computers can store and transmit information with ease, and can even perform logic operations via transistors, they cannot meaningfully interpret information the way a human can. Do raspberry pi nodes, hardware wallets, or ASICs understand Bitcoin the way a human does? I think not. The aim of meaningful communication is to prompt some action in the recipient. This aim for action represents the pragmatic level of information. The reason the sender wishes to prompt this response is the purpose of the information, which is the apobetic level of information. These highest levels of information require genuine intelligence on both parties, even a will. Whether or not computers can ever possess a will remains to be seen. \u201cGo tell it on the mountain\u2026\u201d is a string of symbols (code) that create a meaningful message (semantics) with the sender expecting (apobetics) some response from the receiver (pragmatics). The message can only be received if transmitted adequately (good fidelity). Bitcoin as Information Bitcoin (the program) is computer code written in a particular coding language. From the software to the blockchain to the key pairs of wallets, bitcoin is information. This information can be stored, transmitted, and replicated in flash drives, printed books, or DNA molecules. Because it is now so widely dispersed, it is virtually impossible at this point to destroy. Politicians and bankers may not like it, but the genie is out of the bottle and cannot be stopped now. As they say, you cannot ban Bitcoin, you can only ban yourself from using Bitcoin. Fidelity and syntax are the operational parts of information. Semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics are the higher levels of information concerned with the purpose and response of intelligent beings based on the meaning of the message. In Bitcoin, fidelity \u2013 or clarity of transmission \u2013 is achieved by the internet (and has even been accomplished by HAM radio) connecting a network of nodes, miners, and wallets. The syntax of Bitcoin consists of the coding languages used to write and execute Bitcoin Core and related software on those devices. The meaning, or semantics, of Bitcoin is a perfectly scarce, immutable, digital token. The highest purposes of Bitcoin \u2013 the pragmatics and apobetics \u2013 are demonstrated in the users that run miners, nodes, and wallets who are motivated and seeking to secure their wealth from theft, either by robbery or debasement. The internet is now a mature and high-fidelity communication system. It cannot be destroyed without simultaneously destroying humanity as we know it. The computer codes and languages utilized by Bitcoin are sufficiently distributed such that eliminating them is essentially impossible. But even if you could somehow destroy the fidelity and syntax of the network, the idea of Bitcoin \u2013 the semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics \u2013 is too widely distributed to defeat. At this point, it has found its way into the minds of millions of people around the globe. Perhaps you could destroy the internet and every last hard drive holding the blockchain and every last computer running Bitcoin, but you would have to hunt down every last Bitcoiner to eradicate the idea of Bitcoin. And who knows, due to the ungovernable actions of some mad scientist, you might have to hunt down all the E. coli, too. This is a guest post by Daniel Howell.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Bitcoin has had another period of intense and record-breaking success, spurred on both by positive developments in international business and by increasingly large commitments from the spheres of traditional finance. It\u2019s truly stunning how well Bitcoin has been performing throughout the first quarter of 2024. The year began with Bitcoin\u2019s valuation crossing the $40k mark, and March 1 saw a persistent hover around $60k. Now, however, Bitcoin has gone up to $72k, the highest valuation in its entire history. Although we still are not quite at the level where \u201cdigital gold\u201d is more valuable than gold itself, we have even reached a new milestone: by market cap, Bitcoin is currently a more valuable commodity than silver. Considering the immense role that silver has played in global currency for thousands of years, this is certainly a milestone to remember. This period of success has been especially noteworthy for the continued confidence it\u2019s been enjoying from some of the largest financial institutions in the world. On March 10, for example, it was reported that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager and prominent issuer of the Bitcoin spot ETF, had finally acquired enough bitcoin that it surpassed even the holdings of MicroStrategy. Considering that its board chairman, Michael Saylor, is such a Bitcoin evangelist, this development seemed especially huge. It was an even bigger surprise, however, when Saylor announced that he was buying enough to reclaim its leading position the very next day. Less than 24 hours passed between this original announcement and MicroStrategy\u2019s purchase of 12k bitcoin, and this purchase took place when Bitcoin was already enjoying a price point over $70k. This purchase put MicroStrategy at the head of nearly every other private bitcoin stockpile, from all publicly traded miners to several major exchanges and ETF issuers. It\u2019s a stunning display of confidence in Bitcoin that anyone is prepared to make such major investments at a time when it\u2019s never been more expensive. It seems that the mood in these companies is that the all-time highs of today will seem like a paltry sum in just a few years. Analysts from ETF issuer Bitwise, for example, were confident enough in their prediction that corporate entities representing trillions of dollars would begin ramping up investments that Bitwise\u2019s Chief Investment Officer released an official memo on the subject. Claiming \u201cserious due diligence\u201d conversations with everyone from hedge funds to massive corporations, the memo predicts that Q2 will see even more massive inflows than the first three months of the year. This just leaves us with one question: Where does this kind of confidence come from? The center of the issue seems to be the runaway success of the Bitcoin ETF and, in particular, BlackRock\u2019s dominating position over the main issuers. Initially, it struggled with Grayscale, which had several natural advantages: it was a Bitcoin-native company with a massive stockpile, it was a real leader in the legal battle to actually get SEC approval, its GBTC was a previously-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, and it had other tricks up its sleeve. Nevertheless, BlackRock is the ETF that reached $10 billion faster than any other in history, shooting ahead of all other Bitcoin competitors and indeed all ETFs in general. Much of this revenue came from users fleeing GBTC\u2019s high fees, and it seems like a confident industry leader today. Its success has even matured to the international stage, as Mudrex, a crypto investment platform based in India, is opening up BlackRock ETF sales to institutional and private investors in a country with more than 1 billion people. This kind of success from BlackRock in particular has also led some of its competitors to change up their tactical approach. VanEck, for example, made an announcement on March 11 that they were waiving all fees on their Bitcoin ETF for an entire year. This will only continue so long as their VanEck Bitcoin Trust is under $1.5 billion, but the fees after this window will still be some of the lowest available. Grayscale, for its part, is also seeking to address the problem of high fees by spinning off a \u201cmini-version\u201d of its ETF, offering fractions of Bitcoin for a fraction of GBTC\u2019s fees. It seems that BlackRock\u2019s competitors are not yet willing to concede a market with such tremendous growth potential. However, although the ETF market has been especially hot lately, that is not the only reason to believe that Bitcoin\u2019s doing so well. ABC News, for example, credits some positive developments from the United Kingdom as a major factor in Bitcoin\u2019s price jump. Britain has previously been considered a particularly hostile regulatory environment for Bitcoin, especially the ETF, trailing behind both Western Europe and most of the Anglosphere in official Bitcoin approval. It was quite a surprise, then, when the London Stock Exchange (LSE) released a new factsheet on exchange-traded notes (ETNs), deciding that this type of financial instrument would be offered on their platform. ETNs do differ substantially from ETFs, even those like the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has no direct link to Bitcoin itself. ETNs are a type of debt security and do not even include the proviso that the issuer actually holds the bitcoin in question. Still, they are directly tied to the value of Bitcoin and offer investors a way to gain exposure to the world\u2019s leading digital asset. Considering that these ETNs are subject to the stringent rules that govern securities, it\u2019s particularly interesting that the LSE has suddenly changed its tune on Bitcoin-related financial products. In other words, it seems that the sea change in legal Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States has undeniably changed the calculus for businesses worldwide. With all these billions flowing into the Bitcoin ETF, even an unfriendly regulator like Great Britain must join in the bonanza if it wishes to maintain relevance as a leading hub of global finance. These are just a few of the developments that have occurred in the world of Bitcoin, as the intersection between decentralized currency and traditional finance has become both broader and deeper. Looking forward, there are still plenty of upcoming events, like the halving predicted in April, to keep propelling the hype forward. It may be difficult to predict exactly where the next major development and price jump will come from, but right now it looks as if there is a growing faith coming from some true financial giants. Bitcoin has come an incredibly long way since the days of its total pariah status, and now there\u2019s well over a trillion dollars in the market. With growth like that, it\u2019s an easy win to keep betting on Bitcoin.","article_summary":"Bitcoin tops out price records again between major ETF inflows and new offerings in the UK.

This one: Ariel Aguilar and La Bitcoineta European Edition at BTC Prague. That car is the Bitcoineta European Edition, and the cheerful guy is Ariel Aguilar. Ariel is part of the European Bitcoineta team, and has previously driven another similar car in Argentina. In fact, there are currently five cars around the world that carry the name Bitcoineta (in some cases preceded with the Spanish definite article \u201cLa\u201d). Argentina: the original La Bitcoineta The story of Bitcoinetas begins with the birth of 'La Bitcoineta' in Argentina, back in 2017. Inspired by the vibrancy of the South American Bitcoin community, the original Bitcoineta was conceived after an annual Latin American Conference (Labitconf), where the visionaries behind it recognized a unique opportunity to promote Bitcoin education in remote areas. Armed with a bright orange Bitcoin-themed exterior and a mission to bridge the gap in financial literacy, La Bitcoineta embarked on a journey to bring awareness of Bitcoin's potential benefits to villages and towns that often remained untouched by mainstream financial education initiatives. Operated by a team of dedicated volunteers, it was more than just a car; it was a symbol of hope and empowerment for those living on the fringes of financial inclusion. The concept drawing for La Bitcoineta from December 2017. Ariel was part of that initial Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and spent weeks on the road when the car became a reality. The original dream to bring bitcoin education even to remote areas within Argentina and other South American countries came true, and the La Bitcoineta team took part in dozens of local bitcoin meetups in the subsequent years. The original La Bitcoineta from Argentina. One major hiccup came in late 2018, when the car was crashed into while parked in Puerto Madryn. The car was pretty much destroyed, but since the team was possessed by a honey badger spirit, nothing could stop them from keeping true to their mission. It is a testament to the determination and resilience of the Argentinian team that the car was quickly restored and returned on its orange-pilling quest soon after. Argentinian Bitcoineta after a major accident (no-one got hurt); the car was restored shortly after. Over the more than 5 years that the Argentinian Bitcoineta has been running, it has traveled more than 80,000 kilometers - and as we\u2019ll see further, it inspired multiple similar initiatives around the world. Follow La Bitcoineta\u2019s journey: Twitter: https://twitter.com/labitcoineta Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bitcoineta/ El Salvador: Bitcoin Beach In early 2021, the president of El Salvador passed the Bitcoin Law, making bitcoin legal tender in the country. The Labitconf team decided to celebrate this major step forward in bitcoin adoption by hosting the annual conference in San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador. And correspondingly, the Argentinian Bitcoineta team made plans for a bold 7000-kilometer road trip to visit the Bitcoin country with the iconic Bitcoin car. However, it proved to be impossible to cross so many borders separating Argentina and Salvador, since many governments were still imposing travel restrictions due to a Covid pandemic. So two weeks before the November event, the Labitconf team decided to fund a second Bitcoineta directly in El Salvador, as part of the Bitcoin Beach circular economy. Thus the second Bitcoineta was born. Salvadoran\u2019s Bitcoineta operates in the El Zonte region, where the Bitcoin Beach circular economy is located. The eye-catching Volkswagen minibus has been donated to the Bitcoin Beach team, which uses the car for the needs of its circular economy based in El Zonte. Follow Bitcoin Beach: Twitter: https://twitter.com/Bitcoinbeach South Africa: Bitcoin Ekasi Late 2021 saw one other major development in terms of grassroots bitcoin adoption. On the other side of the planet, in South Africa, Hermann Vivier initiated the Bitcoin Ekasi project. \u201cEkasi\u201d is a colloquial term for a township, and a township in the South African context is an underdeveloped urban area with a predominantly black population, a remnant of the segregationist apartheid regime. Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as an attempt to introduce bitcoin into the economy of the JCC Camp township located in Mossel Bay, and has gained a lot of success on that front. Bitcoin Ekasi was in large part inspired by the success of the Bitcoin Beach circular economy back in El Salvador, and the respect was mutual. The Bitcoin Beach team thus decided to pass on the favor they received from the Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and provided funds to Bitcoin Ekasi for them to build a Bitcoineta of their own. Bitcoin Ekasi\u2019s Bitcoineta as seen at the Adopting Bitcoin Cape Town conference. Bitcoin Ekasi\u2019s Bitcoineta as seen at the Adopting Bitcoin Cape Town conference. Hermann Vivier is seen in the background. South African Bitcoineta serves the needs of Bitcoin Ekasi, a local bitcoin circular economy in the JCC Camp township. Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as a sister organization of Surfer Kids, a non-profit organization with a mission to empower marginalized youths through surfing. The Ekasi Bitcoineta thus partially serves as a means to get the kids to visit various surfer competitions in South Africa. A major highlight in this regard was when the kids got to meet Jordy Smith, one of the most successful South African surfers worldwide. Coincidentally, South African surfers present an intriguing demographic for understanding Bitcoin due to their unique circumstances and needs. To make it as a professional surfer, the athletes need to attend competitions abroad; but since South Africa has tight currency controls in place, it is often a headache to send money abroad for travel and competition expenses. The borderless nature of Bitcoin offers a solution to these constraints, providing surfers with an alternative means of moving funds across borders without any obstacles.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Digital Currency Group, a venture capital firm, has filed a motion to dismiss a criminal suit filed against them by the New York Attorney General\u2019s office. The legal battle between DCG and the NYAG has been ongoing for several months, and is directly entangled with a dispute between two other prominent crypto firms: Genesis, a now-defunct brokerage firm, and Gemini, exchange and bank. These groups have been entangled in a series of disputes that trace back years, involving dramatic relationship changes and serious fraud accusations. A particularly relevant twist in the whole situation is the fact that the bankrupt Genesis is and has been a subsidiary of the substantially powerful DCG, which holds billions\u2019 worth of assets under management and counts ETF issuer Grayscale as another subsidiary. In other words, untangling the background for all the different players involved here is a fairly significant undertaking, especially considering the fraught environment that currently exists. Not only is the attorney general\u2019s suit directed against DCG, Genesis and Gemini in equal measure, but Genesis and Gemini have also faced off in civil suits independent of this. The NYAG accused these firms in October 2023 of collectively defrauding investors out of more than $1 billion, and the mutual recriminations involved have created a messy atmosphere. To begin, as good a place as any is a recent revelation found in court filings surrounding this dismissal. Specifically, court documents this March have made it public knowledge that Genesis and Gemini considered a merger in 2022. In 2022, DCG CEO Barry Silbert conducted a meeting with Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss over lunch, to discuss some of the motivations and logistical issues with merging the two corporate entities together. At the time, Genesis was in serious danger of bankruptcy, and its substantial partnerships with Gemini meant that the fallout would likely damage the other company\u2019s business. Gemini had lent substantial funds to Genesis as part of the Gemini Earn program, which Genesis had proceeded to lose. The hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was in charge of this money when it went belly-up in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, and Genesis was faced with a $1 billion dilemma. As for the original source of these lost funds, the NYAG has accused the firms of defrauding this money from investors. At the meeting, Silbert made the sales pitch that the two firms should combine, and that they \u201cwould be a juggernaut and would be competitive with Coinbase and FTX\u201d. He added that, even if Genesis and Gemini couldn\u2019t reach an agreement on these terms, \u201cthere is a ton more Gemini and Genesis can do together and the two companies should be leaning in together, not pulling apart\u201d. Although Winklevoss was allegedly \u201cintrigued\u201d by the proposed deal, it did not happen. Frictions, alongside Genesis\u2019 declaration of bankruptcy, arose in the immediate aftermath. A particular point of friction is found in the aforementioned Gemini Earn partnership, which made headlines this February when Genesis won a court ruling against Gemini. Essentially, Genesis owned a tranche of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares that were promised to Gemini as collateral for an exchange of money between the two companies, but Genesis declared bankruptcy before the shares could actually change hands. Since GBTC is unique among the Bitcoin spot ETFs as a pre-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, this tranche of shares had ballooned by early 2024 to be worth more than $1.2B. DCG\u2019s ownership of both Grayscale and Genesis put an extra complication over the issue. Gemini objected to Genesis\u2019 legal right to sell the shares it was promised years prior, and this began a lengthy civil suit. Although the issue was resolved through a series of settlements that allowed Genesis to make the sale and kept both it and Gemini from admitting culpability, the NYAG still filed a complaint alleging that the parties involved were all jointly guilty of substantial fraud. There were more than a billion dollars missing, and the attorney general\u2019s office was growing tired of the mutual recriminations between the relevant parties. Even if Genesis could make enough money from their sale to recoup their investors, that still doesn\u2019t address the issue of criminal activity. A particular illustration of the hostile environment came up when DCG, Genesis\u2019 parent company, disputed Genesis\u2019 own settlement with the NYAG. So, this brings us to the present day. On March 7, Silbert and DCG filed a motion to dismiss the attorney general\u2019s suit, claiming that the allegations against these companies were entirely baseless. In the motion, DCG\u2019s legal team claimed that \u201cThe allegations against DCG in this case are a thin web of baseless innuendo, blatant mischaracterizations and unsupported conclusory statements. In search of a headline-worthy scapegoat for losses caused by others, the OAG [Office of the Attorney General] wrongfully seeks to portray DCG\u2019s good-faith support of a subsidiary as participating in fraud\u201d. They specifically claim that DCG acted in good faith by funneling money towards Genesis after the Three Arrows collapse, investing \u201chundreds of millions of dollars of additional capital into its subsidiary during the months leading up to its bankruptcy, even though DCG had no obligation to do so\u201d. The attorney general took a different view, that DCG\u2019s net contributions conceal a large drain of Genesis\u2019 money at one crucial moment: DCG took their money back, Genesis declared a \u201cliquidity crunch\u201d and did not allow users to withdraw their crypto, Genesis went bankrupt immediately. The burden of proof is on them, however, to demonstrate that this was a deliberate fraud tactic. As of yet, there is no way of knowing what a judge will think of DCG\u2019s proposed defense or motion to dismiss, or if a settlement is feasible in the event that the motion to dismiss is denied. However, one unambiguously good sign has come out of the morass: Gemini announced its plans to fully reimburse the allegedly defrauded users of the Gemini Earn partnership with assets in kind. In other words, these users had Bitcoin stolen from them in 2022, and Gemini has made commitments to pay them back, accounting for Bitcoin\u2019s price jump since then. This has tacked on another $700M to the price tag of reimbursing over $1B in assets, and is a clear sign of confidence from the company. Source If nothing else, this decision to reimburse users like this is an impressive display of sincerity and good intentions from Gemini. Gemini is named as a co-defendant on all the legal documents submitted by Silbert\u2019s legal team about the NYAG suit, and would also benefit greatly from seeing the suit dismissed. This gesture of good faith might not be enough to clear the air for DCG and Genesis, but it certainly couldn\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s chances of escaping the whole fiasco without a criminal conviction. Although Gemini failed to halt Genesis\u2019 attempt at getting the money from GBTC sales, Gemini is still a successful and prominent exchange. Apparently, it was able to float a compensation of this size without relying on the GBTC tranche. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to how the suit will proceed in the coming months. When the NYAG first filed a complaint after the first round of settlements, it seemed clear that the prosecutors were quite fed up with the acerbic attitude of these former business partners. Nevertheless, Gemini\u2019s restitution plan will surely go a long way in proving their intention to do right by their users. If nothing else, it shows that they\u2019re proactive in taking the issue seriously. We\u2019ll have to observe the situation carefully as it develops, but it does seem clear that the mutual loathing and underhandedness displayed so far has not been rewarded. The broader digital asset space has periodically been filled with shaky businesses and outright scams, but eventually they all fall apart. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has come by its success legitimately. When the dust settles, the biggest winners might actually be the defrauded users, who collectively will see their expected payout nearly double thanks to Bitcoin\u2019s own strength. Compared to those kinds of gains, it\u2019s hard to imagine a scam working much better.","article_summary":"Digital Currency Group files motion to dismiss NYAG criminal suit.

In true Web3 tradition, the collection was launched by a seven-member $KARMA Council, bringing together 10 leading Ordinals communities behind $KARMA\u2019s mission. The $KARMA Council\u2019s airdrop aims to foster a sense of community amongst early Ordinals participants and bolster the burgeoning ecosystem. Strength in Numbers: Growing the Ordinals Ecosystem $KARMA is a token launched by a seven-member council, including four representatives from the OnChainMonkey (OCM) community: Soldman Gachs (@DrSoldmanGachs), Fitzy (@fitzyOG), Rabbi (@RabbiGains), and Drheref (@DrHeref). They are joined by BennyTheDev (@rarity_garden) and Alex Philippine (@Skrylabs) from Tap Protocol, bringing their technical expertise. Jason Fang (@JasonSoraVC) from Sora Ventures, a lead investor in Metagood, creators of OnChainMonkey, and the Tap Protocol is the final member of the Council. Fostering strong relationships with other communities is something that the $KARMA Council believes will be an essential step in achieving the $KARMA community\u2019s goals. Accordingly, a significant number of tokens have been earmarked for future \u2018Karmunity\u2019 Incentives. The $KARMA community incentive pot will continue to activate future partnerships or activations that will help to further expand the $KARMA and Ordinals community. This could include rewarding valuable community members, partnering with additional projects, or general growth initiatives. The Ordinals Community Airdrop With this in mind, the $KARMA Council decided to airdrop 49,968,900 $KARMA tokens to communities within the Ordinals ecosystem. This was designed to push towards $Karma Council\u2019s goal of expanding both the OCM & Ordinals ecosystems. The Council sought to take an objective selection process. For this initial airdrop, they selected the top 9 collections by market capitalization at the time of the snapshot at Block Height 828,888 (4 February 2024). The 9 communities eligible to receive $KARMA tokens in the Community Airdrop are: Bitmap (https://ordinalswallet.com/collection/bitmap) Bitcoin Punks (https://bitcoinpunks.com/) Bitcoin Puppets (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/bitcoin-puppets) Bitcoin Frogs (https://bitcoinfrogs.com/) Nodemonkes (https://nodemonkes.com/) OMB (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/omb) RSIC (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/rsic) PIPE (https://trac.network/Pipe/) TRAC (https://trac.network/) Rewarding the OCM Community A total of 560 million $KARMA tokens are being allocated to holders of OnChainMonkey NFTs. Eligibility for the OnChainMonkey community was based on assets being migrated from Ethereum to Bitcoin. Except for the OCM Karma collection (https://opensea.io/collection/karma-monkey), which has had their allocation of $KARMA reserved until that collection is upgraded to Bitcoin. Since the snapshot has not been completed for OCM Karma, people can still purchase the assets on ETH and when they migrate to Bitcoin, they will be eligible for the $KARMA airdrop. \"Trac is the governance token for Tap Protocol, the first decentralized indexer economy on the Ordinals protocol enabling similar features of ERC20 but on Bitcoin L1. The TAP standard that created $KARMA was conducted by members of the OCM community but has now expanded towards 9 other Ordinals communities,\u201d Jason Fang, founder of Sora Ventures said. \u201cTap protocol contains many more features compared to BRC20 that enables developers and projects to stake, send cost effective airdrops, and enable token distributions that make building on Bitcoin most cost effective, safer, and scalable.\u201d \"$Karma embodies the spirit of innovation and community, serving as a beacon for the next generation of decentralized ecosystems. We're thrilled to champion this groundbreaking initiative led by our OnChainMonkey community members and investors,\" remarked Amanda Terry, co-founder and COO of Metagood. \"At OnChainMonkey, we\u2019re a community of builders and innovation and impact are woven into our DNA. Just as Bitcoin revolutionized finance, $Karma is poised to redefine collaboration, economic empowerment, and impact, with strong communities early to Ordinals at its core.\u201d Technical Milestones for Airdrops The airdrop of the $KARMA tokens was performed in an efficient manner utilizing \u201cTapping,\u201d a core feature of the TAP Protocol. \u201cTapping\u201d is a process of transacting that makes it considerably cheaper and faster to distribute tokens to a large amount of addresses. Using the existing BRC-20 standard, conducting an airdrop for 61,000 wallets would have required over 122,000 transactions. The KarmaCouncil was able to complete the entire airdrop using under 55 transactions, therefore setting a precedent for the future of community inclusions for future airdrops on Bitcoin. BRC20 requires 2 transactions for a single transfer of tokens between 2 parties. The TAP Protocol allows for many transfers within 2 transactions. 1 transaction with many receivers at once and a 2nd transaction to approve the transfers (called \"tapping\"). This reduces the costs for airdrops significantly in comparison to BRC20 as there is almost half of the transactions needed. It also helps to put the Bitcoin network under less stress due to lesser amounts of transactions required. TAP Protocol's token authority feature allows it even to reduce it further using only 1 transaction, which makes it also attractive for simple individual transfers. Token authorities require additional setup configurations however, while airdrops work out of the box. A Note on Tap Protocol and the Technology Trac Core is an indexing solution (created by Trac Systems) designed to enable decentralized tracking of Ordinals metaprotocols on Bitcoin. Trac Systems is also the creator of the Tap Protocol. Creating the $KARMA tokens on the Tap Protocol was conducted by the community. Tap Protocol is a similar to BRC-20 and allows for features and hooks into DeFi that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be possible natively. In layman-terms, Tap Protocol can be seen as BRC-20 \u201con steroids\u201d. Taps airdrop feature is cheap because it combines receivers of different token types and amounts into 1 inscription. About $KARMA (https://karmacoin.xyz/) $KARMA is more than a token; it's a commitment to growth, community, and innovation. Designed as a catalyst to expand the OCM and Ordinals ecosystems, $KARMA is set to redefine engagement and opportunity for the entire Ordinals community and beyond. $KARMA is a network of founders, builders, industry leaders and seasoned collectors in the Ordinals ecosystem.

Interviewer: Hua, freelance writer, independent researcher. X: @AmelieHua Interviewee: Poly, a Controls Specialist, maintains multiple Distributed Control Systems (DCS's) and has worked with other five nine systems (99.999% uptime availability). X: @Polyd_ Covenants are an old yet fresh topic. As early as 2013, developers began discussing this topic, and in recent years, multiple BIPs aimed at implementing covenants have been proposed, sparking intense debates and making it one of the hottest topics. Covenants warrant serious discussion due to their powerful capabilities. They are considered to bring new possibilities to the programmability of Bitcoin and are believed to enable smart contracts. For Bitcoin, this is undoubtedly a double-edged sword. In this article, we will explore what covenants are, how they work, their robust functionality, and their significance for Bitcoin. While discussing details, this article often uses CTV as an example, but CTV is not the only method of implementing covenants. This article delves into the exploration of covenants but also magnifies a slice of Bitcoin under a microscope for observation. Through this observation, we can understand how Bitcoin operates at a granular level, comprehending both its capabilities and limitations. Understanding what it cannot do is as crucial as understanding what it can do because only then can we choose the right path for building on Bitcoin. 1. Hua: Before discussing covenants, clarifying two issues related to Bitcoin may be necessary, which can help us better understand covenants. We know that Bitcoin uses a scripting language, and it is known that scripting languages support the implementation of smart contracts. However, in reality, smart contracts have not been implemented on the Bitcoin main chain. This inevitably creates a sense that implementing smart contracts on Bitcoin faces some insurmountable obstacles, and it seems impossible on the Bitcoin network. However, many people may not be aware that although Bitcoin can be programmed using a scripting language, the set of opcodes is extremely limited. This limited set of opcodes restricts the programmability scope of Bitcoin, meaning that, although the scripting language can implement smart contracts, programmers do not have sufficient \"tools\" to implement smart contracts. Poly: Definitely, Bitcoin Script can be considered limiting as it can only perform the basic operations such as making simple payments. Some of the reasons that people may find it \u201climiting\u201d is that it doesn\u2019t have a global state, it\u2019s not considered turing complete, it uses a UTXO-based system (which has \u201cvalue blindness\u201d) instead of an account-based system. The last big reason is that very little data from the blockchain itself can be integrated into contracts causing blockchain-blindness. This has created a lot of challenges over the years as people have worked around these limitations. We\u2019ve also had a semantic shift with the term \u201csmart contract\u201d to mean one specific thing when you should consider the lightning network a production of many smart contracts formed by many individuals. Those multi-sigs with hashlocks and timelocks are not only smart contracts, but also have time-based covenants. The problem is, just as you mentioned before, because Bitcoin only has simple opcodes to perform just the basics, if you attempt to scale beyond two people in a smart contract, you can get either a lot of bloat for an on-chain footprint or the things you want to do just might not be possible. This strict limitation comes from a few places, I think the biggest being that when the inflation bug occurred back in 2010, Satoshi had disabled a whole list of higher order opcodes including OP_CAT which would\u2019ve allowed us to create more dynamic smart contracts via transaction introspection. BCH has since overcome this limitation within their own script, showing that Script isn\u2019t as weak as everyone assumes, just that Bitcoin has always been slower due to its decentralization and coordination is near impossible except over long periods of time. We\u2019ve also barely touched on Taproot and Tapscript which will alleviate a lot of the footprint concerns and allows for new behaviors such as BitVM by rolling up the contract into the signature and you only reveal as necessary. Hua: Why are there strict limitations on opcodes? Can you use OP_CAT as an example to help us understand this point? Poly: So OP_CAT is deceptively simple, it will take two strings and add them together. It was originally disabled because it had resource issues and could be used to cause nodes to crash, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the full story as Satoshi set the 520 byte stack limit and disabled OP_CAT in the same commit so there could be more to it than just simple resource exhaustion. But just to give a short list of what OP_CAT can perform: CTV/TXHASH covenants, verify SPV proofs, double-spend protection for 0-conf TXs, 64-bit arithmetic, vaults, quantum-resistant signatures. The list goes on, with OP_CAT alone, it can emulate both CTV[CheckTemplateVerify] and TXHASH style transactions. The only issue is it\u2019s highly inefficient in the manner that it performs these actions that might be possible, but that could just preclude these transactions from being desirable except by users of scale such as custodians. 2. Hua: Let's talk about another \"limitation\" of Bitcoin. Bitcoin only supports \"verification\" as a form of computation and can't do general-purpose computation. We also know that, for example, smart contracts on Ethereum contain rules for state transitions. It completes the state transition through computation, enabling the functionality of smart contracts. In comparison, Bitcoin can't do general-purpose computation, meaning it cannot achieve state transitions through computation on its own. Is my understanding correct? Poly: Yeah, I\u2019d agree that\u2019s a simple summary of the current state of things. Bitcoin could be made to support computational transactions and the line can become quite thin when covenants and state transitions are involved, but those proposals aren\u2019t as well researched and might not be something that\u2019s considered desirable. I\u2019m actually not that much of a fan of the way Ethereum does things. Due to it being computational in nature with the verification built on-top, if I attempt to perform a trade, my window could shift and I could \u201cfail to trade\u201d but the transaction for the attempt to trade was still valid so i still paid for fees which wasted my money on what i\u2019d want to consider a failed transaction and wasted blockspace for someone else. Another weird aspect are the Oracles in Ethereum. Oracles must pay gas to update their oracle prices whereas in Bitcoin DLC\u2019s, the Oracle are blinded and are just providing a signature and can\u2019t be \u201cpinned\u201d due to a change in fees nor can Oracles target specific contracts. Earlier I discussed all the downsides to the UTXO model compared to the account model and global state model, but what allows the UTXO model to shine is parallelism. The only concern you have is the child transactions to the same UTXO, nothing else matters, this allows the system to scale much better. 3. Hua: Let's start discussing covenants now. What are covenants? Poly: Covenants usually refer to restrictions on how coins can be transferred. The word covenant seems to carry some sort of connotation with it so it helps to demystify it and explain it as simple locking mechanisms you can place only on your *own* coin. We have two covenants already inside Bitcoin and they power the Lightning Network, CSV [CheckSequenceVerify] and CLTV [CheckLockTimeVerify]. Some just call these opcodes \u201csmart contract primitives\u201d as they\u2019re simple time locks, but they can also be classified as time covenants. CTV [CheckTemplateVerify] is a proposed Bitcoin upgrade and is included in BIP 119. It is different from CSV and CLTV, you can think of CTV as a \u201cTXID [Transaction ID] lock\u201d or \u201cUTXO lock\u201d, only these TXID\u2019s can be made from this lock. For CTV, we refer to this TXID lock as \u201cEquality Covenants\u201d as the resulting transactions must equal to the original transactions that were committed. It\u2019s also called a deferred commitment covenant, as you can see that your UTXO has been committed to, but it isn\u2019t yet placed on-chain. The most known alternative is SH_APO [Any Previous Out or AnyPrevOut] which focuses on the payout commitment being ensured while allowing the pay-in method to be flexible. A few others discussed are OP_CCV [also known as MATT], OP_EXPIRE, TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY. Hua: When you mention \"covenants usually refer to restrictions on how coins can be transferred,\" can I understand it like this: Covenants are a method of specifying how funds can be used, or in other words, it's a way of restricting where funds can be spent. Poly: Yep, it effectively earmarks the UTXO to be distributed in a specific manner, once you commit to it, you can't take it back, it's now consensus bound, and only its new owner can decide how to spend their funds. When a UTXO is created on-chain, our instinct is to assume that a single private key is holding that UTXO in place. But if it was a CTV bound UTXO, when the UTXO is spent, you'll see an extra 32 byte hash paired with the new transaction that represents the hidden state that was inside the original UTXO. Hua: You've mentioned \"TXID lock/UTXO lock\" multiple times. Can I understand it like this: To understand how CTV achieves their functionality, we need to understand what TXID lock is and how it works. TXID lock is a key mechanism. Poly: Yes, It creates a strong foundation to build further schemes. The TXID is determined by the contents of a tx. And if you can add inputs to a tx, you can manipulate the TXID. CTV makes you lock the number of inputs and outputs. This is how we ensure that CTV commitments are trustless, if the TXID could be malleable, you could potentially be able to steal someone\u2019s funds. Once you have a TXID locking mechanism, you combine it with other locking mechanisms such as the time locks to build even greater smart contracts. 4. Hua: Why do you think covenants are a rabbit hole? Poly: I call covenants a rabbit hole because there\u2019s so much you can do with simple restrictions on transactions such as a time lock or a TXID lock. We\u2019ve managed to build the entire Lightning network with simple time locks and while it isn\u2019t perfect, it is the only truly decentralized L2 in existence. I don\u2019t like how it\u2019s slowly shifting towards being custodial focused, but that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019ve started down this rabbit hole to begin with: To make our smart contracts more powerful. We refer to the TXID lock as a Template. With Taproot, we gained the ability to have signature aggregation. With Templates and CTV, we gain the ability to have transaction aggregation. CTV serves as a replacement for a pre-signed transaction oracle, which eliminates the trust and interactivity requirements needed to create more sophisticated smart contracts that are needed for things like vaults and payment pools. The vaults and payment pools that you can make with CTV are technically possible today, but currently they\u2019re precluded by the trust or interactivity needed to make it work. Moreover, with CTV, we can build channel factories, additional layer 2 solutions such as Ark, Timeout-Trees, Stakechains or Surfchains, and JIT fidelity bond solutions such as PathCoin. Probably my favorite feature is Non-Interactive Channels [NIC\u2019s] that we\u2019ve also been referring to as Cold Channels. The basic idea is to take a normal lightning channel and simply place it in a CTV template. What makes this different from a normal lightning channel is that neither party actually needed to be online to create this channel. So if I need a channel with another person, I don\u2019t need them to be online to create it, I don\u2019t even need to tell them I made it until I\u2019m ready to spend from it! This allows for cold storage capability on lightning because I don\u2019t need a watchtower nor a node to safeguard my funds in any channels that aren\u2019t yet active. Third-party coordinators can also establish NIC\u2019s for two individuals so there\u2019s a lot of flexibility in what\u2019s possible. As it stands, CTV won\u2019t allow you to build a DEX on-chain, but I\u2019m not sure if that is such a bad thing as people are currently trying to build DEX\u2019s off-chain using the Lightning Network as it is today. I think this ties back into the \u201cVerification vs Computation\u201d discussion, how much do you really want on-chain versus how much do you need to verify on-chain. One concern I have about on-chain DEX\u2019s, besides the excessive on-chain updates driving higher fees, is MEV. We\u2019ve already spotted some MEV from BCH\u2019s DEX\u2019s transactions and as the market matures, this is bound to get worse. Hua: Can you give an example to help us understand how CTV works? Poly: Let\u2019s say I am expecting to receive 5 BTC, as of right now, the only thing I can do is receive the payment and verify it on-chain. With CTV, I can commit to future addresses or to people and reduce it down to a simple pubkey that I give to my payer to pay me. They don\u2019t know the details of it so it remains private to everyone but me. Once I can confirm that they\u2019ve paid me, all of the actions I took using the CTV template have now also taken effect. So if I had elected to create a channel with Bob, once Alice pays me, the channel with Bob is now committed, even though the channel with Bob is nowhere to be seen on-chain, it is only accessible by my template and the transaction that Alice had created. It\u2019s only known to me until I share the channel details with Bob. Once I do share the details with Bob, we can use the channel as normal. When we cooperatively close the channel, instead of needing to place an open channel details on-chain, we just place the closing channel on-chain. This allows us to perform transaction cut-through, reducing the total number of transactions that need to be on-chain by at least half for layer 2 solutions. The opening portion only needs a commitment, what we really care about are the closing details. If this was a shared UTXO with multiple people, we could collaborate to close our transactions together as well, reducing the number of on-chain transactions even further. 5. Hua: As you mentioned before, we can introduce different opcodes to implement covenants. Poly: So if we re-introduced OP_CAT, I think it would allow for nearly every type of covenant possible as you can emulate any form of introspection for TXHASH. The more limited method would be to introduce opcodes representing the explicit behavior desired like with CTV, CSFS or CheckSeperateSignature. CTV is the ability to do deferred outputs. CSFS is the ability to do deferred signatures so you can defer the payment itself. They sound similar and in fact they work well together as building blocks to enable LN-Symmetry, but the commitments are happening at different levels. TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY both enable introspection and serve the same purpose, but TEMPLATE KEY uses a single-byte mode while TXHASH uses multi-byte flags. This allows for much more powerful capabilities inside script and smart contracts, but many are concerned about the side effects it could have. TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY are more of a CTVv2, something that would make CTV more powerful and expressive. Hua: I've noticed that there doesn't seem to be a significant disagreement about whether to support the implementation of covenants. However, in comparison, there seems to be more significant divergence among people regarding which method or set of opcodes to add to implement covenants. Poly: I think a large part is there\u2019s different camps of thought. There\u2019s a lot of the lack of understanding the intent behind each proposal as they have different goals in mind and are designed in completely different ways. A lot of developers have only had their eye on Lightning and how it\u2019s to evolve, they tend to favor opcodes like SH_APO since it enables LN-Symmetry. For a lot of developers that don\u2019t particularly like Lightning due to its limitations such as Inbound Liquidity constraints or the requirement to be online, they tend to favor opcodes like OP_CAT, TXHASH as more expressive scaling solutions. The developers that prefer CTV are more neutral and are looking at it from a systems point of view, it doesn\u2019t necessarily do any one thing perfectly but it greatly enhances everyone\u2019s ability to do their preferred thing, whatever it may be without introducing risks that can\u2019t be measured since it doesn\u2019t introduce introspection. 6. Hua: Before discussing covenants, we talked about issues related to opcodes in scripting language and the problem of limited computation leading to state transition. We already know the relationship between covenants and opcodes. Now, let's delve into the issue of state transition. I'm not sure if looking at covenants from the perspective of \"state transition\" is correct, but this perspective truly fascinates me. Without covenants, the scripting language's main function is to retrieve transactions' signatures and verify them. The transaction can only be completed when the private key is correct, and there is no intermediate state. With covenants, a transaction can be completed when certain conditions are met. Moreover, a transaction can only be completed when specific conditions are satisfied (not just the correctness of the private key). Can we understand it this way: Covenants indirectly provide conditions for state transition. Poly: The covenant is the template shell or the \"state\". Inside of it, you're going to need to make time locks and other functions to enable the desired functionality that you\u2019re wanting, be that a vault, lightning channel or some other layer 2 solution. So CTV allows for the state creation to occur, but you have to dynamically rebuild the state at each transition to keep it in homeostasis, we call this meta-recursive. Whereas something like SH_APO allows you to create a state and then periodically update that state, making it recursive. CTV can also create a chain of transactions that would allow you to \u201cstep-through\u201d that state. A good example to think about is Ark, it\u2019s a giant smart contract, almost like a giant coinjoin and the one running the protocol creates a new state [or rounds as it\u2019s called] every few seconds to facilitate participants to pay others as needed. Once the Ark operator is ready, they will send a transaction to the mempool to commit the current state to on-chain. These on-chain placeholders can be thought of as the \u201ctransition states.\u201d The operator has to constantly recompute new states to present to the Ark participants and what\u2019s sent to on-chain is the verification of that state. Hua: Can we understand it this way: Covenants implement a form of smart contract based on verification rather than computation? Poly: Yes. Definitely. This smart contract is just comparing a transaction to an associated sha256 hash. Block speed verification would actually increase since there\u2019s no signature operations. Hua: One direction of development for blockchains is modularity, including off-chain computation. However, Bitcoin seems naturally designed for off-chain computation, appearing behind but actually leading the way. What do you think? Poly: Time is a flat circle. It\u2019s crazy how it seems like we\u2019ve come full circle to what\u2019s wanted in a blockchain. Bitcoin still seems to have some modularity issues and footprint issues. I wish we had better side-chains that weren\u2019t simply multi-sig solutions and used actual cryptographic means to secure one\u2019s funds and allowed for Unilateral Exits. I think that would help push the boundaries on Bitcoin\u2019s modularity. Taproot has allowed for even more off-chain computation with things such as BitVM, which would allow us to compute almost anything off-chain. But unfortunately, it can\u2019t emulate things inside Bitcoin such as CTV so it seems we still have progress to make. 7. Hua: What possibilities can be achieved by combining covenants with other opcodes like DLC? Poly: So DLC\u2019s have a few problems that would be fixed with covenants such as increasing the flexibility of the parameters of the DLC by making many price points [if we\u2019re wagering on the price of something such as Bitcoin]. Another one is that hardware wallets [HWW] can\u2019t interact with a lot of DLC\u2019s, the signing rounds for DLCs and attempting to do it with HWWs causes DLCs to take several minutes to open. With CTV, this delay to enter a DLC can be reduced down to seconds. 8. Hua: Are there any other points you'd like to introduce to the readers? Poly: We went over a lot of concepts. We touched on how it can be used to mitigate excessive blockspace demand and potential ddos attacks. We discussed how people could save space by making Non-Interactive Channels. I think another good one to discuss is the \"L2 exit problem\". If we managed to get everyone off of the L1 layer and get them onto a large L2, there's currently no good way to get people off that L2 in an expedited manner. We could think of that L2 as Lightning [we call the potential mass exodus on Lightning, the \"Thundering Herd problem\u201d], or we could think of Coinbase, Binance or Liquid as the L2. There are people who hold claims to Bitcoin, but their only way to actually acquire that claim is by submitting a transaction to get it placed on-chain. There's millions of people on Coinbase, I have no idea how to get them off of there and onto Bitcoin in any orderly fashion in today's environment. There would be a mempool backlog of 6 months attempting to get people off the exchange. CTV can fix this. Make an Ark or a Timeout-Tree with CTV. The exchange could even offer the service directly. Everyone could be offloaded from the original \"shared UTXO\" that was under Coinbase's consensus and pushed into a \"shared UTXO\" with a consensus of their choice, be it a simple pool or a large Timeout-Tree. This is where it really wrinkles the brain, this was a pure L2 <> L2 conversion. There was no intermediary step requiring me to go down to L1 first. And I can continue repeating this process indefinitely, using any layer of my choice. There isn\u2019t a need to return to the base layer unless I was forced there such as from an uncooperative closeout from my channel or perhaps an unvaulting from my vault. The Ark and Timeout-Tree pitfall is that they have rollover requirements, you have to move your funds every few weeks or months or you forfeit your funds. This isn\u2019t an ideal solution for long-term funds but works great for any short term holdings and larger markets. I'd like to provide a full list of every concept that\u2019s been developed using CTV and its ability to simply aggregate pre-signed transactions: Non-Interactive Channels, Timeout-Trees, Ark, Darkpools, Payment Pools, Payment Channels, Ball Lightning, Congestion Control, Dpool's, Compaction, Tree Swaps, PathCoin, Stakechains, Surfchains. But don\u2019t think of these as all independent Templates, if there\u2019s a feature of one that you wish to include in another, you can create your own custom Template to try and find your desired behavior.

Without this, in one way or another, you are relinquishing control of your money to someone else. \u201cNot your keys, not your coins\u201d as the saying goes. A counter-intuitive aspect of Bitcoin for people who aren\u2019t familiar with the technical underpinnings of it is \u201cwhere\u201d your Bitcoin actually is. When people think of a wallet, they think \u201cthe place where I keep my money.\u201d Your bitcoin wallet doesn\u2019t actually \u201chold\u201d your Bitcoin, it just stores your private keys. Your Bitcoin is just entries of data on the blockchain hosted by everyone participating in the network. When you go to spend your bitcoin, what you are actually doing is proposing an update to the data stored on the blockchain. A private key is how the protocol ensures that you, and you alone, can authorize an update to the blockchain that spends your Bitcoin. So what are your private keys? Just very large numbers. Extremely large. This is a private key in binary: 1110001011011001011110111100000101000100000010001001111010111011010101110111001111111111101010111010010111010011101001110010100110111101000110000111110101111001101001011110011011101000001101101101110001101000110001111010001001001111011010101011001101101010 256 random 1s and 0s. This random number is what ultimately secures your Bitcoin. It might not look like much, but its randomness is what ensures your wallet\u2019s security. There are almost as many possible Bitcoin private keys as there are atoms in the visible universe. That is how many numbers a computer would have to count through to generate and catalog all the private keys potentially possible. As long as the process used to generate the keys is truly random, your keys are safe. This is what a private key looks like in hexadecimal (binary uses two digits to encode a number, 1 and 0, hexadecimal uses 16 digits, 0-9 and A-F): E2D97BC144089EBB5773FFABA5D3A729BD187D79A5E6E836DC68C7A24F6AB36A This is what a private key looks like in uncompressed Wallet Import Format (WIF): 5KYC9aMMSDWGJciYRtwY3mNpeTn91BLagdjzJ4k4RQmdhQvE98G WIF format is how everyone used to interact with their private keys in the early days of Bitcoin. In this era, you could generate one private key at a time, and then you\u2019d generate the public key from that. The process of generating a public key is essentially just the multiplication of very large numbers but there is a bit more to it than that.. All public keys are an x and y point on a graph showing a very, very large curve that loops back on itself. On the graph curve, in Bitcoin\u2019s case Secp256k1, there is a point called the \u201cgenerator point.\u201d This generator point can be thought of as the \u201cbase point\u201d on the Secp256k1 curve. It is integral to the process of generating keys and signing with them. This is what the generator point is for Bitcoin\u2019s curve: G = 02 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798 To generate the public key from your private key, you take the private key you generated and multiply it by the generator point. That\u2019s it. This now establishes a point on the graph with a mathematical relationship to the private key you generated that only you know. This is an uncompressed public key showing both x and y points: 04C0E410A572C880D1A2106AFE1C6EA2F67830ABCC8BBDF24729F7BF3AFEA06158F0C04D7335D051A92442330A50B8C37CE0EC5AFC4FFEAB41732DA5108261FFED It is very common to \u201ccompress\u201d public keys in the rare chance you interact with them to just store the x coordinate with a byte to tell you whether the y coordinate is negative or positive. That shortens it considerably: 04C0E410A572C880D1A2106AFE1C6EA2F67830ABCC8BBDF24729F7BF3AFEA06158F0C04D7335D051A92442330A50B8C37CE0EC5AFC4FFEAB41732DA5108261FFED When you go to sign a transaction with your private key, it once again boils down to essentially just multiplication. By generating a random number (the nonce), and using that and your private key to essentially multiply the hash of the transaction you are signing, you produce the signature (which is made up of two values, r, and S). This allows someone to run an algorithm to verify the message was signed by the appropriate private key without revealing that key. The thing guaranteeing only you can authorize spending your Bitcoin is essentially just the multiplication of very, very large numbers. If you aren\u2019t all that familiar with these concepts before reading this, all of this probably seems somewhat intimidating. Binary? Hexadecimal? Graph points? How do you back up a WIF? Since the development of more intuitive ways of handling this data, most users are unfamiliar with these complicated formats. Most likely, you have more experience with word seeds, also known as seed phrases. BIP 39 Mnemonic Seeds Mnemonic seeds, or seed phrases, were created to address the problem of the experience of interacting with your private keys. As we discussed earlier, private keys are ultimately just a long series of 1s and 0s that are randomly generated. Imagine trying to create copies of this and ensure you didn\u2019t make an error transcribing it: 1110001011011001011110111100000101000100000010001001111010111011010101110111001111111111101010111010010111010011101001110010100110111101000110000111110101111001101001011110011011101000001101101101110001101000110001111010001001001111011010101011001101101010 All it would take is a single error copying one digit to render a backup of your keys useless. This is where mnemonic seeds come in handy. 256 consecutive 1s and 0s in a row is not a human-friendly way to interact with sensitive information. Recording this number incorrectly means losing access to your account. truck renew fury donkey remind laptop reform detail split grief because fat That is much easier to deal with, isn\u2019t it? Just 12 words. So how does that work, going from a bunch of random 1s and 0s to a string of words that actually make sense to you? An encoding scheme, just like binary or hexadecimal! Each of those 12 words in that mnemonic seed above is a binary number in an encoding scheme mapping specific strings of 1s and 0s to words. If we look back at the WIF private key example earlier, that was simply a number encoded in a specific encoding scheme, in that case, base 58, which uses every number and letter of the alphabet except 0 and 1, and O and l (case sensitive). The exclusion of those characters was done specifically to make transcription errors unlikely by confusing a 1 for an l, or a 0 for an O. bech32 and bech32m used by Segwit and Taproot take this to the next level by using only this set of characters (qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l). Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 (BIP 39), introduced a standardized encoding scheme where each word in a specially crafted dictionary is alphabetically mapped to a binary number from 00000000001 to 11111111111. The demonstration seed above maps to this: truck: 11101001001 renew: 10110110001 fury: 01011110011 donkey: 01000001001 remind: 10110101110 laptop: 01111101000 reform: 10110100010 detail: 00111100010 split: 11010010001 grief: 01100110100 because: 00010011110 fat: 01010011011 In just binary it looks like this: 11101001001 10110110001 01011110011 01000001001 10110101110 01111101000 10110100010 00111100010 11010010001 01100110100 00010011110 0101001 1011 There are 2048 words, each mapped to a specific 11 digit string of 1s and 0s, specifically to make it easier for people to interact with their private keys. When you generate a random number for your private key, your wallet cuts that number up into chunks of 11 digit binary numbers and maps them to the BIP 39 Mnemonic dictionary. It\u2019s still the same large number, but now you can read it as English words. Since your brain is much more accustomed to this format than long strings of 1s and 0s, this drastically reduces the odds of you writing down something wrong and losing your Bitcoin in the process. You may have noticed that in the raw binary encoding of the word seed above, there are four digits (1011) sitting off on their own, and the last \u201cword\u201d is only actually 8 digits. That is a checksum to ensure that a seed phrase is valid. When you generate your random number, there aren\u2019t enough digits to map it exactly to 12 (or 24) words. The wallet hashes those existing digits you generated and takes the first few digits of the hash to add on to the end of your random number. This gives you enough digits to map to the last word. This last word allows you to perform a safety check on copies of your seed. If you enter your mnemonic seed into a wallet incorrectly, the checksum will not match. Each 12 or 24 word seed has multiple potential valid checksum words, but if the last word doesn\u2019t match the checksum of a correct seed your wallet will warn you it is invalid. This gives people an intuitive yet still mathematical way to guarantee their backups are correct, unlike the messy process of transcribing and backing up the raw binary numbers. The selection of the specific words on the list even went so far as to guarantee that none of the 2048 words have the same first four letters. This was done to reduce the likelihood of people making transcription errors by confusing similar words and winding up with an incorrect backup of their private keys. Translating these words into a set of multiple private/public keys is quite simple. Your mnemonic seed is taken and hashed using SHA512, which outputs a hash of 512 individual 1s and 0s. Half of that output is used as an actual private key, and the other half is used as input to SHA512 with an index number and the existing private or public key to generate a new key pair. You can do this as many times as you want to generate new private/public keys that can all be recovered from your single mnemonic phrase.

History has shown us time and again that centralized control inevitably devolves into tyranny, eroding the foundations of liberty upon which free societies are built. The 10 planks of communism, as outlined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in The Communist Manifesto, that serves as the blueprint for transitioning society to a collectivist system cannot be implemented without centralization first occurring; due to the fact that communism at its core seeks to abolish every form of private ownership while enthroning the state as master of all. The sad reality is that these planks have been gradually implemented over the years by most countries in the world, thus progressively eroding free markets and the overall liberty of their citizens. The centralization of speech online is the most recent threat that has emerged as a potent tool for state control. Ironically, this phenomenon resembles the realization of plank 6 of the communist manifesto, which advocates for the \"centralization of the Means of Communication and Transport in the Hands of the State.\" As commerce and communications via online platforms grows, these two very important aspects of human existence become centralized in the hands of the big tech companies that own these platforms. In our cancel culture driven world, the increasing overlap between centralized social media platforms and financial services has significantly increased the risk of absolute censorship; where violating the constantly changing \"community guidelines\" can lead to one becoming persona non grata and being immediately deplatformed. Without decentralized alternatives, censoring any speech or transaction that is deemed \u201cundesirable\u201d becomes a trivial matter. Big tech social media giants acting as the de facto thought police and enforcers for the state, wield immense influence over the flow of information, and suppress every form of dissent through the threat of financial strangulation when one doesn\u2019t toe the line. There are two major factors that undergird this power to silence dissent online: Centralized nature of the social media platforms Centralized payment processors like PayPal that dominate these platforms For individuals who rely on social media for their livelihood, deplatforming represents a significant threat, not only to their ability to express themselves freely but also to their income. Self-censorship naturally becomes the norm and this is even more dangerous as it creates the illusion of alignment with the current thing of the day. Thankfully, Bitcoin has made these payment processors irrelevant and due to it being fully decentralized, neutral, apolitical and censorship resistant; it\u2019s a viable alternative. Code is Speech In 2013 Cody Wilson, the pioneer of the world's first 3-D printable gun, received a letter from the State Department demanding removal of blueprints for his plastic firearm, the Liberator, or risk facing jail time and millions in fines. In 2015 Wilson's organization, Defense Distributed, filed a lawsuit against the State Department, alleging that prohibiting the publication of his plans, which are essentially computer code, constitutes a prior restraint of free speech rights, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US constitution. The dispute revolved around the State Department\u2019s claim that posting 3-D printable gun files online constitutes a potential breach of arms export controls, a controversial set of regulations known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). The history of ITAR has been marred by controversy and contention. In the 90s, it was used to target cryptographers (aka cypherpunks), classifying strong encryption tools as military munitions. After the source code for PGP was released and printed out as a book, it immediately fell under First Amendment protection. Despite this seemingly obvious fact, its inventor Phil Zimmermann, was subjected to a grueling three-year Department Of Justice (DOJ) investigation during these Crypto Wars, which was subsequently put to bed without any indictments. In 1995 cryptographer Dan Bernstein also sued the DOJ, arguing ITAR violated his First Amendment rights, and won the case. This was the landmark case that designated code as speech. Despite the State Department's two-year enforcement of ITAR against Defense Distributed, it failed to stop the proliferation of its 3-D printable gun files online. Instead, concerns over censorship spurred over 100,000 downloads of the Liberator blueprint in just two days! Despite removal from Defense Distributed\u2019s websites, the file quickly spread to platforms like the Pirate Bay, making erasure nearly impossible. Attempts to ban speech in the digital age are not only absurd but futile because of its ability to manifest in infinite forms.The historical example of RSA's classification as munition highlights the futility of restricting information as epitomized by printing forbidden information on t-shirts. Information must be free. Export-controlled RSA encryption source code on a T-shirt turned the shirt into a restricted munition. In an interview I had with Jessica Solce, the film maker and executive producer of Death Athletic: A Dissident Architecture a documentary that profiled Cody Wilson and the 3D-printed guns movement; when commenting on the significance of Cody\u2019s battle with the government she said, \u201cCody entangled the First and Second Amendment by pushing guns into the digital era. He utilized the burgeoning technology of 3D printing to reduce a gun to code. This WikiWeapon, the Liberator, was directly inspired by Wikileaks, and immediately threatened the Government\u2019s axis of power and control. It was a masterful play that antagonized the military complex and forced the conversation of gun control into the age of the Internet.\u201d In other words, Wilson didn\u2019t just challenge the military industrial complex\u2019s monopolization (i.e., centralization) of firearms manufacturing. His stance extended to firmly resisting instances of government overreach that sought to regulate and control information pertaining to emerging technologies, which in and of itself is another form of centralized control. A condition which George Orwell described in his book 1984 as, \u201can endless present in which the party is always right\u201d. Interestingly Jessica also encountered firm resistance from centralized content distributors and media outlets when the film was released, as it definitely didn\u2019t fit the \u201capproved narrative\u201d because on the surface it looks like a film about guns but it\u2019s really a story about the power of free speech and free access to information in the internet age. Clearly the time is ripe for more decentralized content distribution and streaming services that are integrated with Bitcoin payments, think Angel Studios on a Bitcoin standard. This will empower content creators to not only profit from captivating content while simultaneously challenging centralized control over information, ensuring artistic creative control, prioritizing truth, and preservation of free speech., but I digress. In July 2018, three years after Defense Distributed challenged the State Department\u2019s actions in court, they accepted a settlement offer from the State Department, including a license to publish its files and a payment of nearly $40,000. When questioned about the settlement, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert justified the decision, stating that the Department of Justice advised settling the case to avoid likely loss on First Amendment grounds in court. Information must be free. This and many other ongoing legal battles faced by Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed underscore important aspects of individual rights and freedom of speech that must be defended. These battles serve as a reminder that: The state seeks to control and capture new technologies by \u201cany means necessary\u201d Lawfare and bureaucracy are the weapons of choice in achieving this aim More decentralized technological tools and protocols that incorporate Bitcoin as the monetary layer need to be built to ensure the preservation of liberty and individual sovereignty. Jessica echoed similar sentiments when stating one of the biggest takeaways that she hopes people will get from Cody\u2019s story; \u201cThe takeaway is to build however you can - community, resources, decentralized systems, archive history and information. The battle for information, the era of the Internet and the battle for its control must be understood as a type of new frontier. Many are against second amendment rights so I\u2019d ask them are they truly against the free and open dissemination of information as well? Do they like someone telling them what they are able and not able to understand and read?\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. Decoding Free Speech in the Digital Age Just like PGP or Cody\u2019s 3D-printable gun designs, Bitcoin at its core is fundamentally open source code, thus Bitcoin is speech. In the words of Beautyon,\u201cThere is no point in any Bitcoin transaction that Bitcoin ceases to be text. It is all text, all the time.\u201d The ruling in the Bernstein v. The DOJ case set a precedent that recognized code as protected speech under the First Amendment, and therefore this protection also directly applies to Bitcoin. Fundamentally, Bitcoin is a messaging system and functions much like email and text messaging, all of which transmit messages. Its primary aim is to definitively confirm an owner's control over a cryptographic key, represented as a block of text, enabling access to a corresponding entry in the global Bitcoin network ledger. The point here is that restriction of communication using programming languages is an example of a prior restraint of speech. Attempts to ban Bitcoin are just as ludicrous as banning memorizing 12 words in your head or outlawing certain musical scores .Does this mean that the powers that be will not try to outlaw Bitcoin and increase their grip on the narrative through censorship? You bet they will! Just like they have declared war on free speech online by rebranding it as a war on \u201cmisinformation and disinformation\u201d, propaganda is also being disseminated by the corporate media that paints Bitcoin mining in particular, as being harmful to the environment, a claim that has been repeatedly debunked along with the usual \u201cBitcoin is for money launderers and criminals\u201d Time fails me to discuss the latest proposed FinCen regulations and the EU\u2019s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) law which are all very subtle but sinister attempts to gradually cripple Bitcoin in the name of combating money laundering and enforcing know your customer policies.. In the same vein, digital ID\u2019s and central bank digital currencies (CBDC\u2019s), are more than just surveillance tech; but are also weapons for destroying free speech and independent thought. The ultimate road to serfdom. While legal challenges against all these forms of government overreach noted above will be launched and likely won, they take a long time to settle and are usually very costly. The best solution is to develop more open-source, decentralized technological tools that will thwart and defang any attempts by the state to censor speech. As big tech companies pay lip service to freedom of speech while simultaneously implementing \u201cfreedom of speech not reach policies, online discourse increasingly mirrors the authoritarian control described by Ludwig von Mises when he said: \u201cAt every instant of his life the \"comrade\" is bound to obey implicitly the orders issued by the supreme authority. The State is both his guardian and his employer. The State determines his work, his diet, and his pleasures. The State tells him what to think and what to believe in\u201d. This is even more true today, than it was in 1944 when it was written. Without the freedom of speech we lose a critical part of what it means to be free human beings. Today we may witness the battles between Defense Distributed and the State Department, Wikileaks and the DOJ, Bernstein and the DOJ, and so on. However, one thing remains clear: the players may change, and the time frames may differ, but the underlying struggle has always been centralization versus decentralization, a battle between those who seek to control speech and those who seek to liberate it. Satoshi Nakamoto, Julian Assange, Aaron Schwartz and many others are some of the martyrs of freedom that contributed immensely to the preservation of free speech in our society today. Bitcoin is the best shot that we have at safeguarding the future from being suffocated by the censorship industrial complex leviathan. This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

So nostalgia is the suffering caused by an unappeased yearning to return.\u201d \u2015 Milan Kundera, Ignorance Nostalgia is a powerful emotion. A coping mechanism, an inspiration, or a manipulative rhetorical tool. For quite some time, the inhabitants of the West have found themselves conscripted onto a battlefield of the mind. Society has been reshaping itself or being reshaped at a frenetic pace for decades now. Nostalgia has proven itself to be a potent weapon in the arsenals of every faction on that battlefield. The power of contrast should never be underestimated. Humans are living, breathing, pattern-recognition machines. We cannot help but compare proposed plans and present circumstances to historical outcomes. This is normal, this is healthy: It lets the human mind achieve some measure of confidence in predicting what happens next. The human mind loathes unpredictability more than anything else. The unknown noise in the dark is far more terrifying than the wild animal on the ridgeline that you can observe and predict. The regime knows that contrast holds such power, because it allows for critique. Such was the power of Florida during COVID, for instance. Without a state that was free of lockdowns and mandates, foisting the same circumstances on an entire population across the board would have caused less negative sentiment of those measures. This was the real reason for the mass psychosis and peer pressure of that era. It\u2019s much more difficult to make someone take a bite of a turd sandwich insistently offered to them when there are other options.

Millennials stand astride the old world before 9/11 and the new one, with memories of a higher-trust society with much more prosperity and unity than what we have now. These feelings are amplified by the fact that due to their age, the entirety of the era before the shift was viewed through the rose-colored glasses of childhood. Essentially, millennials are too young to remember the 1992 L.A. riots or the Oklahoma City bombing with any sense of clarity or context, but old enough to remember when innocence was valued and optimism about the future was commonplace. This contrast between a less anxious past and a present that consists of never-ending psychological warfare can be many things. The past can be pointed to as a critique of how far we have fallen and thrown in the faces of the ruling order as dissent. It can also be a coping mechanism, both healthy and unhealthy. From vaporwave to homesteading, from filtered edits of 1980s Miami to thinking about the Roman empire, the aesthetics and contrast of the past are coming back with a vengeance as the present is too Lovecraftian to personify. My personal favorite example of this has been the meteoric resurgence of the band Creed. While the band broke up in 2004, they have miraculously been memed back to life. A video of the 2001 Thanksgiving halftime show they performed in Dallas went viral. Taking place just two months after 9/11, that snapshot in time captured and distilled both the optimism of the time and the resilience of its people. The video entered the narrative bloodstream, provoking remarks about how \u201cwe used to be a real country\u201d and with it, the demand that we deserve something better than this because we once had something better than this. Shortly afterwards the Texas Rangers began to streak toward the World Series after a rough start. The team gave the credit for their comeback to Creed, which they began to play constantly in the locker room for motivation. Home games in Dallas blared \u201cHigher\u201d and \u201cMy Sacrifice\u201d prompting the fans to sing along in a massive chorus. The Rangers would go on to win the World Series, with a reunited Creed attending the game with Jerseys and a newly announced tour across the United States. The winner of this season of The Voice was a burly white guy belting out Creed\u2019s \u201cHigher\u201d during his finale. In a dark time of \u201cIts So Over\u201d lies the burning embers of a \u201cWe Are So Back\u201d. \u201cEvery act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being.\u201d \u2015 Albert Camus, The Rebel Click the image above to download a PDF of the article. But the regime understands the power of contrast, too. The solution to this problem has been to tear down or change the past. Beloved franchises that influence culture are butchered ignobly by the likes of Kathleen Kennedy. Films and shows of historical fiction are made to impose contemporary norms of sex, diversity, and sarcastic cynicism upon our past. Suddenly there have always been black Scandinavians, African Roman legionnaires in Britain, and the great men of history have their conquests and achievements \u201creimagined\u201d to give someone else the credit. Wikipedia is edited, and classical literature and its heroes are \u201creimagined\u201d and judged through a contemporary lens. Visual media is obviously the most powerful avenue with which to do this. A series like Stranger Things seeks to recreate the most familiar possible representation of the 1980s, only to subtly slip in the values the regime wishes to promote as if this state of affairs has always been the norm. Yellowstone receives critical acclaim only for tough cowboys and patriarchal dynasties to spend spare moments reinforcing that a good feller ought to be a feminist. Like an angler fish with a pretty lure and a poisonous bite, designed to entertain you just enough to where the subversion can slip through. This adds a certain sense of urgency to stopping the rot. It is why we must promote and share the best parts of our past, even if it\u2019s something like a halftime show played by Creed. Those of us who remember the time before the world moved on must pass down what was normal and what was good to the generations born inside the throes of hell world who don\u2019t know any better. It is our duty to shout from the rooftops that this isn\u2019t the best we can do, and it\u2019s not the best we\u2019ve ever done. Even if the past must stay in the past, it provides a blueprint for the right kind of future. This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine\u2019s \u201cThe Inscription Issue\u201d.

The potential of Ethiopia as a bitcoin mining hub resides in the promise of a mutually beneficial relationship between the nation and the industry. In this article, we delve into the transformative power of bitcoin mining to uplift Ethiopian society, unveiling five compelling avenues for prosperity in this East African gem. Bitcoin mining monetizes Ethiopia\u2019s surplus electricity Bitcoin mining allows Ethiopia to transform excess electricity into a valuable commodity, fostering economic growth while maximizing the utilization of its abundant hydropower reserves. Ethiopia's allure for bitcoin miners is undeniably anchored in its abundant hydropower resources. Nestled within the country\u2019s mountainous terrain lies the source of the Blue Nile, accounting for a staggering 85% of the Nile's water. This abundant water wealth translates into the immense potential for hydropower generation, making Ethiopia a prime destination for electricity-intensive industries like bitcoin mining. Kal Kassa, Bitcoin Educator at BitcoinBirr and Alen Makhmetov, CoFounder of Hashlabs Mining at \u201cExporting energy through the internet\u201d a Hashlabs Mining event in Addis Ababa With the potential to harness an estimated 60 GW of hydropower, geothermal, wind, and solar, Ethiopia stands as a powerhouse that could theoretically become capable of generating more than three times the electricity consumed by the entire bitcoin mining network. Presently, the nation has tapped into a fraction of this potential, having an electricity generation capacity of 5.3 GW. Assuming a capacity factor of 40%, Ethiopia's current electricity generation capacity translates to a potential of 18.6 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year under normal rainfall conditions. Comparatively, in 2022, the country's electricity consumption amounted to only 14.7 TWh, leaving approximately 20% of the electricity generation potential unutilized. This number will be even higher during particularly wet years. As if Ethiopia's electricity surplus wasn't already substantial, the nation is on the brink of nearly doubling its generation capacity with the commissioning of The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. This awe-inspiring project will claim the title of Africa's largest hydropower plant, boasting an impressive nameplate capacity of 6.5 GW. With an anticipated capacity factor of 29%, sustained by the continuous influx of water to the dam, the power plant is projected to yield approximately 16.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually. This output is equal to 10% of the consumption of the Bitcoin mining network, underscoring Ethiopia's potential to become a dominant force in both energy production and bitcoin mining. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam The forthcoming Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam's anticipated 16.5 TWh of electricity production will propel Ethiopia's total potential generation to a staggering 35.1 TWh annually under typical rainfall conditions. With current consumption at 14.7 TWh, the surplus electricity generation will amount to an impressive 20.4 TWh, corresponding to a percentage electricity surplus of 58%. Ethiopia is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and is set to see a surge in electricity demand, necessitating the expansion of its hydropower infrastructure. However, the non-modular nature of hydropower plants often leads to overbuilt capacity, resulting in surplus generation until demand catches up. The flexibility inherent in bitcoin mining makes it the perfect match for Ethiopia's surplus electricity, offering a means to monetize until residential, commercial, and industrial consumption catches up. Once demand increases, miners can adapt by relocating or contributing to the financing of new power plants. Without Bitcoin mining, Ethiopia faces the prospect of significant electricity wastage until demand aligns. By seizing the opportunity to leverage its abundant energy resources, Ethiopia positions itself for sustained economic growth, with initiatives like Bitcoin mining serving as a catalyst for optimizing resource utilization and driving prosperity. Bitcoin mining increases Ethiopia\u2019s exports and access to foreign currency Ethiopia grapples with a daunting challenge: a staggering trade deficit. With more dollars flowing out than in, the nation faces mounting difficulties in importing vital goods and services. Compounded by a struggling currency, ironically named the Birr, Ethiopia's citizens are vulnerable to soaring inflation rates. In 2022, Ethiopia imported $23 billion worth of products and services while exporting just $11 billion, leaving a cavernous trade deficit of $12 billion. This deficit is straining the nation's ability to meet debt obligations, showcased by the ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a potential bailout. Luckily, Ethiopia's abundant electricity surplus presents a promising opportunity for foreign currency generation through exports. However, traditional avenues like selling electricity to neighboring countries have been limited due to low demand and weak economies in the region, yielding modest returns of around $70 million annually. Enter Bitcoin mining, a revolutionary solution that transcends geographical constraints by allowing electricity to be converted directly into digital currency. With minimal investment in transmission infrastructure, Ethiopia can tap into the global Bitcoin network as a lucrative consumer of its surplus energy. Jaran Mellerud, Alen Makhmetov, and Marek Šafárik, Cofounders of Hashlabs Mining By embracing Bitcoin mining, Ethiopia diversifies its export income and reduces reliance on neighboring countries for electricity sales. With the ability to export electricity through the Internet, the nation gains a stronger negotiating position and can demand higher prices for its exported power. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Yodahe A. Zemichael of the Information Network Security Administration (INSA) highlighted the government's motivation of legalizing the bitcoin mining industry, citing that companies pay in foreign currency for the electricity they consume in data center operations. Considering the official bitcoin mining tariff of $0.0314/kWh, Ethiopia stands to generate a substantial export income of $640 million if it sells all its excess electricity to Bitcoin miners. Furthermore, by self-mining with the most efficient machines available, the country could potentially yield an export income of $3.9 billion, making Bitcoin mining a transformative force in Ethiopia's economy and potentially its largest export industry. This tantalizing prospect underscores the transformative potential of Bitcoin mining for Ethiopia's economic landscape. Indeed, it's prudent to adjust our expectations to account for real-world factors such as the Bitcoin halving and Ethiopia's likely utilization of a portion of its electricity surplus for other purposes. A more realistic estimate of Ethiopia's export income from Bitcoin mining would likely fall somewhere between $640 million and $3.9 billion, settling in the middle at around $2.3 billion.This figure still positions Bitcoin mining as the largest export industry in Ethiopia, representing a significant economic opportunity for the nation. A $2.3 billion boost in export income would indeed wield transformative power for the Ethiopian economy, providing a vital injection of foreign currency to strengthen the national currency and facilitate easier access to essential imports. Moreover, reducing dependency on foreign lenders would enhance Ethiopia's sovereignty and bolster its economic resilience. At this pivotal moment, Ethiopia faces the imperative of addressing its trade imbalance and charting a course for economic prosperity. Embracing bitcoin mining as a means to export surplus electricity through the internet offers a groundbreaking opportunity to unlock Ethiopia's economic potential. Indeed, it could represent the greatest economic opportunity of this generation for the country. Bitcoin miners can build out electrical infrastructure in Ethiopia The challenge of electrification in Ethiopia is stark: only 54% of the population currently has access to electricity, with rural areas significantly lagging behind urban centers. While cities boast a 94% electrification rate, rural areas struggle at just 43%. The Ethiopian Government has set an ambitious goal of achieving near-universal electrification by 2030, but this endeavor faces significant hurdles. The electrification challenge in Ethiopia, particularly in rural areas, underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions. While the country boasts significant electricity generation capacity, the main hurdle lies in transmitting and distributing this energy to remote communities. Bitcoin miners offer a potential solution by financing and constructing substations in rural areas with surplus electricity, such as those near The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. These substations could serve not only miners but also nearby residents, potentially providing electricity to entire towns. A substation in Africa This approach, akin to efforts by Gridless in Kenya, could complement Ethiopia's goal of near-universal electrification by 2030. Unlike in Kenya, where Gridless focuses on building power plants with bitcoin mining as an anchor customer, Ethiopia already has sufficient power plants. Thus, Ethiopian miners could focus on building out substations to improve the population\u2019s access to electricity. Moreover, the increased revenue from selling electricity to miners could enable Ethiopia to invest in new electrical infrastructure, including substations, transmission lines, and distribution networks. As a result, bitcoin miners could indirectly finance the expansion of electrical infrastructure in Ethiopia, contributing to electrification for Ethiopians and fostering socio-economic development nationwide. Bitcoin mining brings tech jobs to Ethiopia Ethiopia, boasting the second-largest population in Africa with 122 million inhabitants, predominantly comprises a youthful demographic. Regrettably, the nation faces a significant challenge of high unemployment rates among its youth. Introducing the bitcoin mining industry could potentially provide avenues for accessing tech jobs, not limited to mining facilities but also encompassing the broader bitcoin economy poised to develop alongside the foundational growth of the bitcoin mining industry. Bitcoin mining will bring a significant amount of jobs to Ethiopians across many talents and skills. On this, Advisor at Hashlabs Mining Ethiopia, Kal Kassa says: \u201c500 jobs per bitcoin miner is a high goal to meet and I doubt this rumor we\u2019ve been hearing is an honest reflection of the government\u2019s intent to regulate and add thresholds to investment. That being said, facilities with investment over $100 million are very likely to require more than 500 personnel, contractors, vendors, and local suppliers. In fact, we see more than double that in interest from technicians and electrical engineers. Training and certifying skilled talent will be a pillar of our objectives in Ethiopia and I have no doubt we will inspire a generation forward.\u201d Additionally, Hashlabs Mining has sponsored the onboarding of hundreds of wallets at ALX Ethiopia, DevFest\u201924, and the Information Network Security Administration (INSA) in keeping with this vision. Kal Kassa with Elias Abebe, COO of Hello Solar Technology PLC Kassa continues, \u201cFor programmers and devs building, I urge them to build a profile and open a free lightning wallet with sost.tech and similar initiatives to get paid in bitcoin. BTrust Builders may also be a solid destination for experienced computer engineers and enthusiasts. Hashlabs Mining Ethiopia, and various additional sponsors, will be supporting these educational and vocational efforts via the funded Hashlabs Education Fund and BitcoinBirr.\u201d BitcoinBirr, a community of educators and innovators, boasts a strong vision for providing bitcoin learning materials across several languages and regions. Telegram is the most popular platform for communication among its mods and members. Most recently Kal Kassa gave a presentation titled \u201cMining Bitcoin of the Nile River\u201d at Bitcoin Oasis in Dubai. In the next few weeks, and with sponsors from across the world, BitcoinBirr would like to complete the bitcoin training of all 2,000 staff at INSA, in addition to other institutions and organizations that have requested bitcoin education. Beyond hackathons and presentations, Hashlabs Mining is committed to the training of talent in tech. Private sector leaders like Mehrteab Leul and Associates (MLA), Yingke Consultants, Grant Thornton Advisory, MMCY Tech, Boseti Energy Exploration, Meedo Records, HabeshaView, Flawless Events, Education Matters Addis, Tryst Cafe, Ethiopian Airlines and Sheraton Addis are highly appreciated and we honor your friendship during our work in Ethiopia. Ethiopia can leverage mining to build a bitcoin treasury The Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH), the country's sovereign wealth fund, has been rumored to partner with a Chinese bitcoin and data mining group. As per a LinkedIn post shared by EIH\u2019s official account, we understand the project will consist of a multi-million dollar investment. Jaran Mellerud, Cofounder of Hashlabs Mining at an event in Addis Ababa Given the natural series of events that occur with bitcoin miners, the accumulation of bitcoin may be a way for Ethiopia\u2019s treasury to maintain a balance of BTC on behalf of its country. As methods for collateral and proof of reserves develop within the bitcoin \u201cspace\u201d, these reserves may be used to prove creditworthiness. The events surrounding Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may also be instructive to Ethiopians. There is also a sentiment from some Bitcoiners that governments should not be involved in bitcoin mining. And that bitcoin is an experiment by cryptopunks and libertarians to create tools for the free market. Given Ethiopia's recent communist history from 1974 to 1991, Ethiopia\u2019s citizens and leaders may need a refresher course on the Austrian School of Economics. Conclusion We are witnessing significant development in real time. It\u2019s difficult to point towards a singular event or catalyst. But we are at the center of a very serious and interesting moment in our history. The moment we are experiencing allows value to be generated from an open and free community of bitcoin miners. And this novel technology allows humanity to preserve value across time and space. As we dive into the future, it may also be important to note the need for humility. It should be remembered that over the past few years, Ethiopians and East Africa have witnessed a haunting amount of death and destruction, often self-inflicted and many times manipulated on the world stage. We can\u2019t bring back our fallen friends. Like our dear brother Tekeste Sebhat Nega, an early bitcoiner and a visionary. He lost his life in the last few weeks of 2020. An energetic and smart young man died in a senseless civil war. And there are many more stories like him. The entire country is going through a syndrome of sorts, so let\u2019s remain humble as we carry the burden. Let\u2019s move with purpose, passion, and dignity toward a future that values math and physics more than fiat and violence. That is our hope for ourselves and that\u2019s the energy with which we will operate in Ethiopia. This is a guest post by Jaran Mellerud & Kal Kassa.

Roman Reher of Blocktrainer, the largest German-speaking Bitcoin YouTube channel, and Kristian Kläger, CEO and founder of terahash.energy GmbH, delivered two formidable introductory presentations in the German Parliament. Since German politicians still mainly associate Bitcoin with criminal activities, money laundering, and climate damage, the objective was to nurture a better understanding of the unique opportunities Bitcoin has to offer. Privacy was paramount to kickstarting the event. Given that Bitcoin remains a complicated subject in German politics, ensuring full privacy for attending MPs and their staff was crucial to spare them potential reprimands from their party leaders. The event was well-attended, also by visitors from outside. Since MPs preferred to take a backseat on the main floor, ordinary visitors were invited to fill the front seats. Overall, the event was a big success, and more Bitcoin events in the Bundestag are in the pipeline. While cameras were not permitted during the main event, a few exclusive moments later allowed for capturing select opinions on camera. Joana Cotar is the founder of the initiative 'Bitcoin im Bundestag.' As a party-independent MP, she has the privilege of putting Bitcoin on the agenda, for example, during debates about the introduction of the digital Euro. As a party member, this would not have been possible. Still, her former affiliation with the right-wing AfD poses challenges too. In German politics, guilt by association is a strong mechanism, and no party wants to collaborate with the AfD. It creates a political vacuum and has led to discussions within the Berlin Bitcoin community. According to her it is good to remind oneself that Bitcoin is apolitical, uncensorable, and free money, and even your worst enemy can use it. Also in the German parliament, Bitcoin is a bottom up movement, and according to Joana Cotar, the staff of the MPs play a crucial role in getting the topic on the agenda. They work long hours with the MPs, and are also often consciously encouraged by Members of the German Parliament to explore new topics. In the following interview, Joana Cotar provides unprecedented insights into the workings of German politics. She discusses the free access banking lobbyists have to the German parliament, their strong influence on MPs, and articulates concrete requests such as making Bitcoin legal tender, allowing for self-custody, promoting sustainable Bitcoin mining, and urging opposition to the introduction of the digital Euro.

Bitcoin's previous all time high of $69,010 happened almost three years ago on November 10, 2021, 846 days ago. For the month of February, Bitcoin had the biggest green monthly candle in its history, rising almost $20,000 that month alone. To put into context how bullish that month was price wise, the bear market bottom for bitcoin was ~$16,000, meaning bitcoin pumped almost $4,000 more than that alone in February. JUST IN: #Bitcoin had its biggest monthly green candle EVER in February 🤯🚀 pic.twitter.com/BsaCIXGTJx \u2014 Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 1, 2024 Bitcoin's meteoric rise has been fueled by a variety of factors, including increasing institutional adoption, growing interest from retail investors, and broader acceptance by traditional financial institutions. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical tensions and inflationary concerns have propelled demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. US spot Bitcoin ETFs had their second biggest day in terms of trading volume yesterday, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. BlackRock's ETF was responsible for $2.4 billion of the $5.5 billion traded yesterday. Last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs bought over 30,029 BTC, while miners only mined 6,160 new BTC. This massive demand and very limited supply of bitcoin being created every day has been the main driver causing bitcoin's price to increase dramatically.

I know this piece will come across as annoying to some, especially because I have only been bullish on bitcoin with some gusto for the last couple of months (though I first pointed it out to my readers in December 2022), but as a newfound member of the church of bitcoin community, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t try out my voice a bit. I apologize in advance for opining on things that many members of planet bitcoin have talked about and debated ad nauseam for the last decade. But, one way or another, I have to get myself up to speed, and I do that best cathartically through writing. As a result, you, the reader, are left here to suffer. So, you know, don\u2019t forget to renew your paid subscriptions to Fringe Finance. Enough with the prelude \u2014 we all know it has been a breathtaking week for bitcoin, which is up well over 20% in just the span of days. \"Oh my fuck.\" - Bubbles, Trailer Park Boys The moves have done well to spin up even more interest in the cryptocurrency than there was over the last month with the launch of the ETFs. Hell, even Morgan Stanley came out this week and said they were thinking of throwing their hat into the ring and launching a bitcoin fund of their own. I\u2019ve gotten a number of phone calls and texts about bitcoin, and I\u2019m not even a prominent member of the community, nor am I a well-known bull. And so I can\u2019t even imagine the outreach that maximalists and longtime advocates have seen this week. Undoubtedly, it is exciting, and I can\u2019t even imagine how long people have been waiting to savor this moment, after years of abuse from family members and uninformed assholes like myself, as well as general doubt about the asset class. But, if there is one small lesson I have learned from decades in the capital markets that I think translates across asset classes, it is to celebrate modestly and prepare for the worst. That may seem like the furthest thing from people's minds this week, but for me, it has always been the best way to savor success. Many people who listened to the podcast that I did a couple of weeks ago with Peter McCormack know that it was arrogance and hubris that turned me off from bitcoin to begin with. Perhaps that is my fault for not having an open enough mind and not doing enough of my own work \u2013 it\u2019s a mistake that saw me miss out on large gains. But today I\u2019m speaking as one of the people who can visualize bitcoin as a long-term success and are genuinely excited about onboarding the rest of the world. My Twitter feed over the last week has been replete with people triumphantly celebrating, bragging, and taking shots at those who doubted that the price would ever go back up again. Here\u2019s one example from my brother James Lavish, who I know well enough to know he won\u2019t mind me using him as an example because he knows I respect the shit out of him. Behold Exhibit A: James talking shit to Vanguard. Does James have a point? Yes, he does. Could be wind up being right 50 years from now also? Yes, he could. But is it karmically sound to taunt the $7.7 trillion bear? To me, not really. I\u2019d rather just savor the satisfaction of the temporary dub quietly. Everybody is well within their rights to celebrate this short-term action anyway they would like, but what I\u2019m suggesting today is that karmically and psychologically, the less you force the issue and the more humility you show, the more evenly and consistently bitcoin will thread itself through the rest of the world. Think of this: celebrating making an exorbitant amount of money or rage-tweeting about your success is going to do two things: (1)it\u2019s going to turn off people like myself who think that behavior is generally synonymous with fraud and (2) it\u2019s going to excite investors with lower-than-average sophistication who will look for quick riches and won\u2019t be the steady hands bitcoin needs to become a perpetual success. Rather, what I\u2019m suggesting is to allow the news media to do what they do (generally be useless and chase stories long after they\u2019ve happened) and allow people to come to the realization about bitcoin the same way that I did: on my own, once I felt as though I wasn\u2019t being suffocated with the idea by outside sources anymore. My interest in looking at bitcoin this go-round in early 2024 was completely organic: the news coverage of it had died down, and I had blocked or unfollowed enough people who were hyping it that I could have some clarity and some peace of mind about it when I sat down to consider how it worked, seriously, for the first time ever. It was that calm, relaxed, blank slate that allowed me to grasp the relatively complex concepts of how it worked and believe in it the way that I do now. I think given the astronomical week that we just had, we\u2019d be better off to \u201cact like we\u2019ve been here before\u201d and to remember that sometimes the more you push an idea, the more people are prone to resistance than barking like hyenas and taunting people. If bitcoin had a $50 trillion market cap, that\u2019d be a different story. But we\u2019re still in the early stages of this courtship with the rest of the world and, like any good relationship or friendship in your life, there has to be a genuine organic interest in \u201cshowing up\u201d to the idea of it happening. All of those who have been smothered by a partner or a friend in the past know that all it does is create distortions and unhealthy dynamics. Such delicate things cannot be forced, but rather, accepted willfully like a slow, purposeful deep breath outside on a winter day. This is not to say that I don\u2019t believe this week is the beginning of much larger adoption that would likely drive the price of bitcoin higher. As I said on the \u201cWhat Bitcoin Did\u201d podcast, I believe that there is at least one, if not several, nation-states looking at putting bitcoin on their sovereign balance sheets, and that this will kick off a period of game theory for the digital asset revolution the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen yet. Just days after I said that, yesterday Edward Snowden came out and postulated the same. Try to keep up with me, Eddie. But in all seriousness, we know what will happen if the price continues to rise. The hype will continue to flywheel further, as will interest and adoption. People will have the same realization that it took me a decade to figure out: this thing simply isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. But if you ask me, especially given the fact that we all know how quickly price moves can whipsaw back to the downside in the short term, I think the community would be well served to focus less on spiking the football here and more on how we will be able to clearly explain and convey the transformation that is unfolding before our eyes in a calm, measured, and comprehensive way. After all, whose questions do you want to deal with on the next 20% overnight whipsaw lower: unsophisticated maniacs or measured investors who already know and expect the volatility that is a certainty. And the more time we spend setting reasonable expectations that bitcoin can easily exceed, instead of overpromising and underdelivering, the less time we have to brag about being right. The journey is the reward. Or, as the bible says: \u201cWhen pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.\u201d \u2014 Proverbs 11:2 But I think if Jesus were around today, he would simply tell us to \u201clet bitcoin cook\u201d.

We founded the Bitcoin Students Network to empower students with knowledge and networking opportunities and encourage them to join the conversation that needs them in it. BSN aims to remove barriers to creating student Bitcoiner communities and strengthen Bitcoin\u2019s Layer 0, the social/human layer.\" BSN aims to act as a bridge between students and the broader Bitcoin industry, facilitating communication and collaboration between educational institutions and industry players. By providing access to resources, job opportunities, and mentorship, BSN aims to strengthen the social fabric of Bitcoin's human layer, known as Layer 0. The network operates on core values such as freedom through knowledge, open-source principles, proof of work, and first principles thinking. These values underpin BSN's distributed yet organized structure, with a founding team, industry board of advisors, and student board of advisors guiding its operations. For students, BSN offers a plethora of opportunities, including starting or growing university Bitcoin clubs, accessing educational and job opportunities, and connecting with like-minded individuals in the Bitcoin community. \"A key part of my journey has been educating the next generation about Bitcoin,\" stated Generation Bitcoin Growth Lead and Co-founder Arsh Molu. \"The Bitcoin Students Network aims to provide support for university clubs as well as equip students with resources, knowledge, and job opportunities worldwide.\" Industry players are also encouraged to participate by organizing events, providing financial support, donating resources, offering mentorship, and sharing internship and job opportunities.","article_summary":"By providing access to educational resources, job opportunities, and mentorship, BSN aims to help younger generations get more involved in Bitcoin.","creation_date":"Mon, 04 Mar 2024 16:21:25 GMT","associated_tags":["Business","Bitcoin","News","Generation Bitcoin","Network","Students"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/generation-bitcoin-to-unite-student-groups-in-worldwide-network","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine"},{"article_title":"Will Bitcoin Transform into Just Another Stock Amidst Institutional Surge and ETF Integration?  ","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Maria Carola"},"article_detailed_content":"Steering through a sea of change in the crypto market, the investment game is experiencing a seismic shift. Spot Bitcoin ETFs already exist, signaling Bitcoin's leap into mainstream finance and knitting it closer to conventional investment fabrics. We'll look at the tip of the iceberg trying to imagine its true depth as well as the current correlation between Bitcoin, stocks, and Gold. We\u2019ll attempt to figure out if the traditional market is really leading Bitcoin out of its decentralized place, or if there's still an avenue for hope that it can maintain its unique path. According to the Kaiko data, Bitcoin's risk-adjusted returns were superior to traditional assets. Nvidia led with the highest returns on a risk-adjusted basis, while Bitcoin impressively trailed just behind, outpacing major traditional assets like the S&P 500, Gold, with its value surging over 160% in risk-adjusted terms. Source: Kaiko Research Meanwhile, according to the IMF Crypto Cycle and US Monetary Policy study, 80% of variation in crypto prices and its increasing correlation with equity markets coincided with the entry of institutional investors into crypto markets since 2020. In particular, trading volumes by institutions on crypto exchanges grew by more than 1,700% (from roughly $25 billion to more than $450 billion) during the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. According to the study, the US monetary policy affects the crypto cycle, just like global equity cycles, but surprisingly, only the US Fed's monetary policy matters, not the other major central banks \u2013 probably because crypto markets are highly USD-dependent. Furthermore, the 2023 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Outlook Survey indicates that 64% of investors are set to up their stakes in the crypto sphere within three years, allocating up to 5% of AUM to crypto. It said a number of institutions made investments for the first time over the past year, while others increased their existing investments. While the study highlights a surge in crypto commitment from 41% of asset managers, only 27% of asset owners seem to be ramping up their stakes. Although Bitcoin was born from the idea of spreading power equally, recent studies indicate that it's slowly becoming dominated by a select few big players. Changing Correlation Dynamics Interestingly, Bitcoin moves in sync with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, with an impressive correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation between Bitcoin and Gold has sharply decreased recently, contrasting with claims that investors see crypto as a safe haven or hedge against inflation, a role traditionally played by Gold. Source: TheBlock Notably, Bitcoin's correlation with Gold was positive at 0.83 on November 7, 2023, but decreased to -0.1 on January 10, 2024, before rebounding to a marginally higher positive level 0.14 on February 9, 2024. In the meantime, Bitcoin's relationship with the S&P 500 saw a negative correlation of -0.76 on November 11, 2023, and then hit a positive correlation of 0.57 in January 2024. Ths shift from negative to positive correlation points to Bitcoin's changing perception among investors. The Nasdaq Composite, known for its technology and growth stocks, also displayed a variable correlation with Bitcoin. The negative correlation, of -0.69 on October 30, 2023, shifted to positive 0.44 in January. It seems traders are linking Bitcoin's rhythm to the tech sector's pulse, hinting at a new kinship in investment strategies. When the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional equity markets like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq increases, while its correlation with Gold decreases, it suggests that Bitcoin is behaving more like a risk-on asset rather than a safe haven. When investors are feeling venturous, they often swing toward stocks and digital coins for the chance at juicier profits. If institutional and retail investors are increasingly involved in both equity and cryptocurrency markets, their simultaneous buy and sell decisions could cause the price movements of these assets to align. Spot Bitcoin ETFs getting the green light seem to be ramping up its charm for big-time investors, with a solid chunk already planning to boost their Bitcoin game. Bitcoin's move into ETFs might make it act more like stocks since those funds are big players in the stock world. Amidst these developments, the essence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, free from the confines of traditional financial systems, could be undermined. Moreover, these shifts could expose Bitcoin to the very systemic risks from which it was designed to escape. Closing Thoughts As we look at how spot Bitcoin ETFs might shake up Bitcoin's role in the market and its current tie to stocks, we need to keep a sharp eye on balancing our excitement for more big players jumping in and the possible growth with staying true to Bitcoin's core principle of not being centrally controlled. Bitcoin's move toward a more centralized investment scene could stir the market, offering bright opportunities, but also tough challenges ahead. This is a guest post by Maria Carola.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. The United States federal government has once again added to its substantial Bitcoin hoard, transferring $922 million worth from wallets associated with Bitfinex hackers in a seizure. Over the course of a series of various seizures and other asset forfeitures, the United States federal government has accumulated and holds enough Bitcoin to unquestionably count as one of the largest whales. In the earliest days of the Bitcoin scene, the overwhelming crypto-anarchist spirit among the community led to a series of various extralegal business ventures, most famously the Silk Road. This overtly illegalist era of the industry is more or less completely over, but the success of these early ventures accumulated massive amounts of Bitcoin: which has in time been accumulated by the US government. The Silk Road alone has been at the center of several massive seizures from law enforcement agencies, with the site\u2019s actual coffers far from the only source. On multiple occasions over the last few years, various hackers who robbed the Silk Road have in turn seen their assets seized and added to the federal government\u2019s massive stockpile. Even though hundreds of millions of bitcoins from this source have already been sold at government auctions or through other means, there are still billions left to go. For their part, law enforcement agencies seem to be in no hurry to wash their hands of these assets. Source On February 29, the stockpile grew once again when the government moved more than 15k bitcoins from the wallets of two Bitfinex hackers. The hackers, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather \u201cRazzlekhan\u201d Morgan, recently testified about their 2016 hack of Bitfinex, which ranks as one of the most profitable heists of all time with nearly 120k bitcoins stolen. Bitfinex, one of the oldest still-operating exchanges in the entire crypto ecosystem, is still a prominent service, but their operations still bear lingering scars from a theft of this magnitude. For one thing, US citizens are completely forbidden from accessing the platform, along with citizens from several other countries. Perhaps it is for this reason that the Justice Department has refused to state whether or not the government intends to reimburse Bitfinex\u2019s 2016 customers, who actually had their money stolen. Regardless of what the government\u2019s plans are with this money, a seizure like this has once again highlighted the sheer size of the federal government\u2019s Bitcoin reserve. Thankfully, the government\u2019s dealings with these assets are all a matter of public record, and Bitcoin transactions themselves are all completely transparent on the blockchain. For this reason, analysts are confident in the claim that the United States holds just shy of 200k bitcoins, worth approximately $12.1 billion. This makes them unmistakably one of the largest whales out there, with only Binance and Satoshi holding greater amounts. In fact, the government currently holds nearly 1% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Regardless of claims that prosecutors have no interest in maximizing profits when disposing of these assets, it\u2019s undeniable that the government holds substantial leverage over the whole space. These seizures are particularly interesting due to some recent comments made by exiled whistleblower Edward Snowden. Specifically, considering the rising global acceptance of Bitcoin in regulation and traditional finance, Snowden predicted that \u201cA national government will be revealed this year to have been buying Bitcoin\u2014the modern replacement for monetary gold\u2014without having disclosed that fact publicly\u201d. If Bitcoin is the digital gold, after all, it would only make sense that powerful nations would want to build up reserves. The strategy has famously worked for the Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, who greeted the new bull market with a declaration that his country\u2019s Bitcoin investment has gone up by 40% since the initial purchases. Not, of course, that he plans to sell. In any event, Snowden\u2019s comments seem especially relevant in that the United States hasn\u2019t actually purchased any of the Bitcoin it currently holds. Even though the government has a theoretical responsibility to dispose of these assets, the pace as of yet has been glacial, and in the meantime, it would be extremely straightforward for Congress to halt these sales. All it would take is a desire for the policy to change, and a genuine Bitcoin reserve could spring up overnight. This is the crux of Snowden\u2019s specific prediction that governments will acquire Bitcoin secretly and that the government has ample plausible deniability. We don\u2019t have a reserve; we just happen to be reserving these assets for a later sale. There is nothing suspicious about that! If a government did actually want to acquire massive quantities of Bitcoin in secret, it would run into a great number of transparency problems caused by the trustless nature of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. The anonymous \u201cMr. 100\u201d has made headlines throughout the month of February, acquiring a mind boggling 100 BTC per day and reaching the status of the 15th largest whale. As chain analysts have tried to determine the buyer\u2019s identity, speculation has already begun that a national government is the culprit. Based on the timing of the purchases and several other factors, the buyer is likely in Asia, specifically the Middle East. Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia\u2014all these are strong candidates to be the coins\u2019 rightful owners. In other words, if a government wishes to build up a Bitcoin reserve, it might be easier to seize the assets outright rather than buy them at fair value. After all, if the transactions will be recorded on the blockchain either way, why not save their money? The UK seems well-positioned to build up a stockpile in this way like the Americans, having seized $1.77 billion in January. Not only were these bitcoins seized from a foreign national currently on the run, with no recourse to recoup these funds, but the British government has subsequently passed legislation deepening its power to seize or freeze cryptocurrency assets. It wouldn\u2019t take much to start building up a notable hoard in its own right. By this point, the days when Bitcoin\u2019s core community held a defiant attitude towards law enforcement are a distant memory. Although people can commit crimes centered around Bitcoin just like they can with any other currency, the fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is only becoming more legitimate for the world\u2019s governments. US regulators approved a Bitcoin ETF, and other countries are falling like dominoes to endorse it themselves. Eventually, it\u2019ll be a necessity for powerful governments to stay on par with their competitors and maintain their own reserves of Bitcoin. The US, after all, controls nearly 1% of a massive industry with substantial leverage over it. Are they going to be the only country with this leverage? It may be difficult for any nation to build up these stockpiles in secret, but even so, the race has already begun. No matter who wins it, it\u2019s Bitcoin that will be on top in the end.","article_summary":"Massive Bitcoin seizures from Bitfinex hackers add to US government stockpile.

In sum, the EIA will voluntarily terminate the illegal EIA-862 collection action they initiated, and they will commit to destroying all the information that they have received and may still receive under the EIA-862. Furthermore, they will also cancel and withdraw the February 9th, 2024 notice for collection, replacing it with a new Notice. This new notice will run for a full 60 days from the date it is released in the Federal Register, and the EIA also has consented to ensure that any comments which have been received on the Feb. 9th notice will be incorporated and considered in the new notice. So here\u2019s the takeaway: the Government has to go back to the well and do it right. They can\u2019t use a pretextual political \u201cemergency\u201d to ram this through, and fortunately the Mining industry, through the quick and decisive work of the Texas Blockchain Council & Riot, blocked that clear violation. But the flight is not over, we have to file our comments on the new data collection notice as soon as it\u2019s released. And you can see that the fight is going to be harder, as groups antagonistic to bitcoin mining are already jumping into the fray. The Sierra Club attempted to file an amicus brief in this case. That brief, which did make it on the record (though it was opposed as improper and it\u2019s moot now anyway), shows their arguments that they will likely elaborate on in a filing supporting the EIA\u2019s new data collection. Those arguments are as weak as you might expect, but they will be out there and will need to be addressed and overcome. Finally, as a lovely cherry on top, the Government will also reimburse the Texas Blockchain Council & Riot Platforms, Inc., for $2,199.45 of court costs and attorney\u2019s fees.

The existing paradigm mirrors the primal imperative of reaping benefits in exchange for labor\u2013working to survive, but the pay-per-time system in the labor market is creating the incentive to get something for nothing. In the whole \u201cfiat stack,\u201d everyone optimizes their efforts to achieve this on different levels, as I explain below. How can I get money for nothing? As we explore the effects of instant settlement across diverse industries, a fundamental divide between workers and clockwatchers emerges, as I have argued throughout this series. Fiat payments work without instant settlement; instead, a virtual credit arrives immediately with the actual settlement usually coming much later. The Lightning Network enables instant settlement. That is a key advantage, and it\u2019s why Bitcoin is the only financial network that has the potential to achieve the vision that I am describing in this series. The fiat monetary system is training us to play the game of rent-seeking without realizing it, and it is no wonder that the best players become the richest. From our first jobs, we learn how to extract maximum payment for minimum effort, and the incentives reward creative ways of doing just that. The first trick everyone learns is how to \u201cmilk the clock\u201d by doing as little as possible without getting fired. A slightly more advanced technique is learning how to take credit for others\u2019 work. Skilled players seek promotions in order to gain access to others\u2019 labor for their own benefit. This is the fiat game. As if that weren\u2019t bad enough, the rent-seeking game also corrodes skills. Just as my results in the gym are correlated with the effort I invest into my workout, employees\u2019 mastery comes from effort. But time-based compensation rewards passing time rather than performance, allowing skills to atrophy. In technologically primitive societies, skill development was imperative for survival. The problem was friction: assessing the value for each miniscule action and compensating each one individually. So the obvious way to reduce friction was to collapse all the tasks into a single variable \u2014 time. But after decades of time-based compensation and diminishing initiative, we are becoming lethargic, weak, skill-deficient, and reliant on free money. The result is a culture of dependency, where the quest for easy money overshadows the pursuit of self-improvement. How many steps are we from enslaving our own children to avoid working? Perhaps the key to overcoming this fate is deciding not to chase the fucking money, but to pursue other goals instead and just using the money to achieve them. Make a list of what you want in life and start working towards it. Instead of working for wages, saving money, and buying a house, you can build your own house. Yes, it will take years, but that is the point. Do the work! If you object that you can\u2019t build a house, you\u2019re probably right. You can\u2019t do anything until you can. It\u2019s simply a matter of placing one brick on top of another, a roof on top of the walls, and so on. Work transforms us, makes us better, faster, stronger, and more skillful versions of our former selves. Bitcoin preserves the value of your energy, allowing you to achieve your goals faster than is possible with fiat. When you are working for others\u2019 goals, you should be compensated instantly, which is almost like double compensation. You get skills and money. In the fiat system, when you get free money (money for time passed), you do not acquire any skills, and the skills you have start to atrophy because you are not using them. The only incentive that pushes people to do something is the fear of getting fired. That is why they seek to find the balance right between minimal work and not getting fired. But there remains an undeniable obstacle: why should I work for my money rather than simply waiting and receiving it without exertion? The status quo is comfortable, but comfort is the enemy. Defeating this enemy requires a collective willingness to break free from the allure of effortless gains and embracing a more natural, purposeful way of working. Those who shun time-based compensation will have the advantage of attracting and retaining the most exceptional individuals as employees. As these forward-thinkers continually evolve\u2013growing faster, stronger, and more skillful over time\u2013their products and services will outshine pay-per-time systems. In the new market landscape I have described throughout this series, employees who are paid for their work rather than their time are no longer tethered to a single company. The quality of products and services is propelled by the collective efforts of the contributors rather than malingering clock milkers supervised and pushed by management. Labor exploitation becomes untenable, and pay-for-work is what retains the best talent. This is true simply because the best want to be paid based on results, and the only fair compensation to both the employee and employer is pay-per-work, which is based on those results. This newfound power may lead individuals to focus on the things they want to see built rather than what the company tells them to build. They gain not only a decentralized income but can also benefit the most from the tasks they complete. If there is an open project to fix ten roads, I will contribute to fixing the one that I use most. It is the most selfish altruistic thing. That benefit is not private; it is shared. The money I receive is private. As long as we chase money rather than projects, it is no surprise we are indifferent towards other people's problems. In this new paradigm, the balance of power shifts decisively to the people, aligning with their preferences and aspirations, not the agenda of a single company. Additionally, the pay-for-work system mirrors the competitive nature of sports\u2013individuals are compensated for their time and effort, but victory is contingent on active participation and skill. In sports, the best players distinguish themselves with their superior skills, the effort they invest, and their adaptability in the face of competition. This natural dynamic, favoring the fastest, strongest, and most adaptable, can now enrich the labor market. Survival and prosperity will hinge not only on individual effort but on the ability to outperform others in the pursuit of a larger share of benefits. Even those merely chasing money prosper by simply mirroring Bitcoin. If I do something selfishly in Bitcoin, the whole network benefits. In the world of sports, fame and wealth often follow the best players, but their initial motivation lies in the desire to be the best. Encouragement in the pay-for-work labor market takes the form of payment, catalyzing continued dedication and progress. The accumulation of these payments, akin to encouragement, propels people to refine their skills, enhance their performance, and, in turn, receive more Bitcoin in acknowledgment of their efforts. The reward in this system is not acclaim or praise; it starts as a necessity for money and progresses to satisfaction derived from the work. Instant settlement becomes the Trojan horse guiding us back to this ethos. In this continuous competition, unlike the win-lose dynamics of warfare, everyone stands to gain. Individuals work for themselves, driven by the desire to achieve their own goals, while the finished product simultaneously serves a common need because a lot of them are collective goods. The swifter, more efficient, and cost-effective completion of tasks that benefit the community will induce a snowball effect where subsequent benefits build on previous ones. In this interconnected web, where everyone coordinates efficiently, there is no theft or exploitation; rather, it is a shared journey toward collective betterment. With pay-for-time, people seek to climb the hierarchy and obtain the privilege of delegating, which lets them shift accountability and find scapegoats. In stark contrast, the pay-for-work built on instant-settlement systems operates like the immutable and uncompromising laws of physics. Every individual bears complete responsibility for their work. This paradigm gauges individuals not by their inclination to assign blame or dwell on problems, but by their responsibility and their commitment to accomplishing the job at hand. The best performance yields the most money, so pay-for-work puts the job first, unlike pay-for-time, where more money results from more time passed, and the job is almost irrelevant. In the pay-for-work system, responsibility becomes a measure of personal and professional integrity, fostering a culture where the focus is on getting the work done efficiently and collaboratively. Roy Sheinfeld, Breez CEO and my boss, has said that we should not tell people what experiences to create in their apps. I agree. The point of the previous chapters was to spark interest in the possibilities so the experts can create those experiences. I am not the right person to say how construction, logistics, book publishing, and other industries should evolve. I am trying to open the window for them to realize the potential they can create and build for all of us. If they do this we all win. They receive Bitcoin, and in turn, we spend Bitcoin more efficiently on things that enrich our lives. This collaborative venture is an invitation to explore, innovate, and contribute to a shared future where everyone stands to gain. Here\u2019s a quick recap with the take-home messages from the previous articles in this series: The first article: The Construction Industry What is work? The conflict between people who are asked to work but benefit from passing time without working. How reputation depends on the work done, not someone\u2019s job title. Second article: The Logistics Industry How delaying payments creates counterparty risk. How intermediaries (banks) compound that risk. How split payments align everyone\u2019s incentives to deliver on a project. Decentralization fostering competition. Third article: The Publishing Industry The dematerialized economy is now on steroids The benefit of any work is determined more by demand for it than supply of it Talking and selling are not the same, so commissions are the best way to compensate influencers Forth article: Real-time Streaming Payments Benefiting from work can be a continuous process with streaming payments. Global benefits deserve global compensation. Auctioning seats to events can transform live entertainment. Fifth article: The Gambling Industry Fiat is gambling. Licenses and credentials disadvantage the poor and reinforce the power of the rich. How to invest wisely. A transitional period is crucial. If a business were to suddenly shift to a performance-based pay model without considering the existing workforce, it could lead to unrest and prompt employees to leave for a pay-per-time company. Those who recognize the need for change should adopt a long-term perspective and implement both payment methods \u2013 pay-per-time and instant settlement \u2013 simultaneously. The objective is to have these methods coexist, attracting top performers and fostering a culture of excellence. Once the company establishes a foundation of high-performing individuals, it can then phase out the pay-per-time structure entirely. I draw inspiration for this approach from my mentor from a distance, Jeff Booth, as these two systems represent distinct paradigms, necessitating a careful and strategic transition rather than an abrupt shift. These are my final messages: Build utility, do not promise future fortunes. Do not wait or ask permission to do work. Do the work that you want to do. Let's Fucking GO!

Bitpac stands for a Bitcoin Based Publicly Auditable Cooperative. Bitpacs are essentially normal bitcoin multisig wallets with the additional introduction of public auditability. Traditionally in a multisig setup, participants of the multisig are not disclosed. In a Bitpac multisig, participants are intentionally made public, which allows for transparent auditability. With this transparency, unique features, tooling, rules, and transaction crafting is possible. The goal of Bitpacs is to emulate the familiar DAO experience on other chains. DAO\u2019s are marketed as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. However, Ethereum and other altcoin based DAOs only inherit the \u201cdecentralization\u201d of their chain, so will not be as decentralized as the same experience built on Bitcoin. DAO\u2019s are also not autonomous, as humans control and shape the decisions they make. The Bitpac definition is a more honest explanation of the tech involved and I think eventually will be a better experience for users. Why should bitcoiners even care about DAO\u2019s? As of Feb 18th 2024, DAO\u2019s on Ethereum hold over $35 billion in treasury funds. There have been millions of DAO proposal makers and voters, and hundreds of millions of dollars have been transacted via DAO governance. (source) There is clear demand for on-chain governance and community management, Bitpacs allow this to come to Bitcoin. How can Bitpacs actually work? While Bitpacs don't directly utilize smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, they achieve similar functionality as DAOs through a combination of multisig wallets and carefully crafted Bitcoin transactions. The structures possible with this encompass most of what a DAO does: Multisig ensures that no one is ever in unilateral control of any Bitpac funds, requiring the quorum threshold to spend anything. Signing thresholds that mandate how many signatures are needed to finalize a transaction (3 of 5 or 6 of 10 for example) can fine tune required voting thresholds in line with the defined Bitpac consensus requirements. Time constraints can be applied to voting rounds, ending the signing process for proposals that haven\u2019t achieved a signing threshold by the end of a voting period. Gating membership of Bitpacs based on certain criteria can be done at the platform level, like unique assets held, bitcoin contributed to the treasury, or known wallet addresses, all of which can be verified on-chain. All of these dynamics that cannot be enforced through Bitcoin script or pre-signed transactions, and must resort to social enforcement, are transparently verifiable on-chain guaranteeing detection of Bitpac rule violations. What do Bitpacs enable on Bitcoin? Bitpacs unlock exciting possibilities for bitcoin users: Community-driven funding: Fundraising for public goods, projects, or charitable causes becomes more efficient and secure with Bitpacs. Contributors can trust that funds are used as intended, thanks to the transparent nature of the multisig. Decentralized governance: Bitpacs empower communities to make collective decisions regarding fund allocation and spending. Voting rights are distributed among key holders, ensuring a transparent and verifiable process. Increased trust and collaboration: By eliminating the opacity often associated with traditional financial systems, Bitpacs build trust and foster collaboration between individuals with shared interests, and doing so fully on-chain. Some specific examples of Bitpac use cases include: Funding open-source development: Developers can create Bitpacs to receive community funding for their projects, with transparent spending records ensuring accountability to their backers. Managing community treasuries: Any organization can leverage Bitpacs for transparent management of their funds, allowing members to track spending, create proposals, and participate in decision-making. Crowdfunding: Bitpacs can be used as a means to crowdfund bitcoin from a group of supporters for a pre-established shared goal, company, investment fund, or project. A major lesson for the industry over the last year has been how much innovation and experimentation can still be done on native Bitcoin without requiring any changes to the network. We have seen massive interest around BitVM, Ordinals, roll-ups, sidechains, layers, metaprotocols, all within bitcoins current consensus. There is clearly a cambrian explosion of developer and user interest coming to Bitcoin which will not slow down any time soon. Tens of thousands of new niche communities will be popping up on Bitcoin in the coming years. This doesn\u2019t include traditional companies that continue to trend towards Bitcoin adoption over time. Bitpacs can agnostically offer community organization, treasury management, and on-chain governance to all of them. The thousands of ideas being \u201cbuilt on Bitcoin\u201d should have one thing in common, eventual settlement on the base layer. Different methods of governance will be experimented with over time, but this is why Bitpacs could be the superior model. Bitpac members have direct voting access to the treasury and transactions occur at the base layer; there is no side-chain, layer, or additional protocol that Bitpac members need to trust. Potentially this cycle, people will start to realize that Bitcoin block space is just as scarce as bitcoin the asset. As we trend further towards a hyperbitcoinized world, with nation states and institutions transacting, I think that Bitpacs representing large community or entity treasuries will be one of the few things that will justify occurring at the Base layer. \u2013 Anybody can create Bitpacs on their own. @Tribe_btc is a centralized project I\u2019m working on aiming to create a full tooling suite for Bitpacs.

While there aren't really any fundamentally new pieces or developments in the Anduro design, they do compose in slightly different ways compared to other existing sidechain systems such as RSK or Liquid/Elements. Anduro is a federated model that makes use of a quorum, referred to as the \u201cCollective\u201d in the released documents. The main distinction between Anduro and other sidechain proposals is the explicit design based around the Collective operating and being capable of spinning up and managing multiple sidechains with different architectures. This is not so dissimilar from the concept of drivechains enabled a wider network of sidechains, rather than a singular one. Anduro is also going to be merge mined, which like RSK (also using a federated peg), does not offer any type of added security for the bitcoin pegged into the sidechain held by the federation. It does however, also like RSK, provide POW security to other assets that might be issued on the sidechain not pegged in from the mainchain and custodied by the federation. Peg And Consensus Model The actual peg between the mainchain and the sidechain is fundamentally the same thing as Liquid, and in detail looks to be roughly identical in terms of structure and implementation. The Collective will be launched with 15 members as Functionaries, the entities actually handling the multisig keys involved with managing the peg, and 50 or more Contributors, which seem to be similar to Liquid partial members that can whitelist and initiate withdrawals from the sidechain(s) even though they are not active participants in processing those withdrawals. Also like Liquid, Anduro will also use a formal organization to handle matters of governance. I.e. handling upgrades to the network, deciding on future changes to the membership set of the federation, and in general any issues that will come up in regards to the operation of the sidechains the Collective is operating. The federation\u2019s security ultimately relies on jurisdictional diversity in order to maintain any type of censorship resistance or safety from fund confiscation even though a federation is composed of honest members. The interesting part of the design here, is unlike RSK, the Collective plays an active role in the consensus process beyond facilitating the operations of the peg mechanism. In Anduro, the Collective actually comes to consensus on the block contents for the sidechain through a Byztanine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm or round robin selection where a single member constructs the blocks for that round. They also periodically sign blocks to function as a checkpointing system to prevent reordering of anything in the historical past. Once signed and checkpointed, miners are incapable of reorging any sidechain blocks without the assistance of the Collective. Both of these factors essentially function as a firewall between Miner Extractable Value opportunities and the miners. MEV is any opportunity available to miners where reordering transactions, such as front running orders on a decentralized exchange, can present an opportunity for that miner to earn extra revenue when they mine their next block. MEV has shown a tendency to increase centralization pressures for block producers in other networks it has become prevalent in. Because of the fact that the Collective is actually deciding the contents of sidechain blocks, and miners are simply committing to them with proof of work, the Collective acts as a shield against those centralizing pressures for block producers (in Bitcoin\u2019s case miners) by taking on the role of actual block construction. Long term Marathon states they intend to work towards trustless peg mechanisms and consensus mechanisms, specifically citing BitVM as an example of how this could be achievable. While this draws into question the ability to maintain the MEV protections the current architecture has in such a transition, it currently prevents MEV from presenting a risk of centralization pressures for miners. It\u2019s also important to note that BitVM ultimately as designed with a prover-verifier model inherently requires defined participants to manage any funds locked in a BitVM peg. While it does radically improve the security model of the peg by allowing provable penalization of dishonest participants by a single member, massive changes to BitVM\u2019s design itself would be necessary to completely remove the need for the equivalent of a federation. Overall the architecture strikes a nice balance of implementing a variant of existing sidechain designs, while in its current iteration intentionally creating a sort of protective layers between the sidechains and miners when it comes to the risks of MEV. The First Two On launch Anduro will have support for two sidechain architectures, one based on Bitcoin, the other on Ethereum. Coordinate: Coordinate is the Bitcoin sidechain variant. It will implement small changes to Bitcoin, including native support for asset issuance similar to Liquid, and is intending to cater towards Ordinals and token use cases such as BRC-20, and the primitive DeFi products and services that have built up around them. Alys: Alys is the Ethereum sidechain variant, essentially just porting the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity to a Bitcoin sidechain. The hope is that it can provide a new learning curve environment for Ethereum application developers to shift their focus towards building services and tools on top of Bitcoin.","article_summary":"Anduro is a federated/merge mined hybrid sidechain design, specifically designed to enable the federation to manage multiple sidechains with differing architectures.","creation_date":"Thu, 29 Feb 2024 19:23:17 GMT","associated_tags":["Anduro","Sidechains","Technical","Opinion"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/anduro-a-network-of-sidechains","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine"},{"article_title":"Wells Fargo and Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Are Now Offering Spot Bitcoin ETFs To Clients  ","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Nik Hoffman"},"article_detailed_content":"Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo & Co.\u2019s brokerage unit have begun offering access to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that directly invest in Bitcoin, according to Bloomberg Law.

Department of Energy case. But, as often happens in litigation, things change quickly. Tuesday the judge entered an order canceling today's hearing based on the parties reaching an \"agreement-in-principle\" on the overall dispute. This agreement must be finalized and filed by Friday, March 1st. Speculation time. What could this mean? One element of the standard for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), and a preliminary injunction, is that the party requesting it has to show that they are \"likely to succeed on the merits.\" This means that the judge has to believe that, not only is success possible, but more likely than not. Here, the judge already agreed that \"that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the facts alleged by Defendants to support an emergency request fall far short of justifying such an action.\" And that the Government's action was arbitrary, capricious, or abused their discretion. Losing the TRO, while not dispositive, is a big red flag. The Government does not like to lose, and once it has lost on this metric, it's very likely that they already know they will lose on the following motions: the preliminary injunction and the permanent injunction. One problem there is discovery. As part of the process of proving the case, the Plaintiffs get to request internal communications and other materials that might show an abuse of discretion or undue influence. The Energy Information Administration has only used emergency data collection authority in a handful of actual emergencies, such as an emergency survey in response to the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Cyberattack. Given the context of Senator Warren and the Biden Administration's continued attacks on Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, is there any reason to believe that there aren't unflattering emails or communications showing undue influence between those offices and the EIA? What else could have caused a historically cautious and respected agency to suddenly put out such slipshod work as the EIA-862, which was then rubber stamped by the President's own Office of Management and Budget in clear technical violation of their internal standards? It is not like this kind of undue influence hasn't happened before... look at Custodia Bank's lawsuit, for instance, where \"perhaps the most stunning fact that would never have seen the light of day but for discovery is this: in the wake of FTX\u2019s collapse and a mysterious briefing to Vice-Chair Barr concerning Custodia\u2019s membership and master account applications, Board staff edited and rewrote key parts of an internal Kansas City Fed memo \u2026 Discovery reveals that the Board was deeply intertwined in the outcome of Custodia\u2019s master account request. That level of involvement is not consistent with the notion of unfettered Reserve Bank discretion.\" Page 54 of Custodia's December 22, 2023 Brief for Judgment as a Matter of Law. While we await more information, it seems clear that any voluntary concession by the Government here reveals some combination of realization that they exhibited either manifest incompetence, or that discovery would bear out significant undue influence on the process.

Now that Bitcoin\u2019s market price is way up, if we were to sell, we would make a profit of over 40% (just from the market purchases), and our main source of BTC is now our citizenship program.

This means that the state is operating and acting in order to preserve and expand it\u2019s own power. For that reason, it is sane and reasonable to assume that state operators are in the trenches of Bitcoin attempting to influence public perception, developer activity, and overall bitcoin adoption. If you think this is not happening then you are naive or you\u2019re incentivized to act against bitcoin in a different way. The sabotage of Bitcoin is not some tin foil hat conspiracy, the sabotage of Bitcoin is actively playing out in real time, but the big question is where the sabotage is taking place and what can you do to identify and act to counter the sabotage? So let\u2019s zoom into Bitcoin of today, where conversation is happening around the future of Bitcoin in regards to dealing with Ordinals, or spam (if you are part of that camp)1. The rise of Ordinals last year and the pressure they have caused on blockspace demand has surfaced new rivalries within the bitcoin maximalist community as memetic warfare is waged on what bitcoin is and how it should be used. The purpose of this article is not to make a political stand in this fight, but to point out places in Bitcoin that are prone to sabotage and where active sabotage campaigns might be actively waged. Seeing this division in a once undivided front is enough to make one pause and consider what external forces are at work. Bitcoin\u2019s Power Balance As we consider the infighting happening within Bitcoin, it is important to understand the different parties within bitcoin and how each of the powers balance each other out. In 2019, Nic Carter illustrated Bitcoin\u2019s Power Balance Model. This model shows the key roles in Bitcoin and the relationship between each one. You can see the circular feedback loop between Miners -> Devs -> Economic Nodes. In a vacuum these three roles would perpetually pump each other with nothing to keep them in check. At the heart of the model are the Users who keep Devs and Economic nodes in check. Bitcoin\u2019s Power Balance Model by Nic Carter source. The one factor in the power model that touches each of the player in the model is the software of code. The software touches each of the roles in one way or another and this is probably the largest threat vector to all of Bitcoin. The simple activity of running code is how Bitcoin is eating the monetary world, so it is probably worth understanding the development process. Bitcoin Development Process Let\u2019s now dig into the Bitcoin development process. As you know, making changes to Bitcoin is a slow and deliberate process. This is a big change from the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d mentality of Silicon Valley. Many argue that this slow methodical process is actually one of Bitcoin\u2019s greatest strengths. In 2011, Gwern published \u201cBitcoin Is Worse Is Better\u201d where he says \u201cHowever, in an example of \u2018Worse is Better\u2019, the ugly inefficient prototype of Bitcoin successfully created a secure decentralized digital currency, which can wait indefinitely for success, and this was enough to eventually lead to adoption, improvement, and growth into a secure global digital currency.\u201d This ugly inefficient code has gotten us here today, 15 years later, and in that time the slow methodical approach to Bitcoin development has been and will probably continue to be a part of the developer ethos. The development process has even been formally documented in BIP 2 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). Here are the general steps in the BIP activation process: Drafting the BIP: The first step is to draft a BIP following the template outlined in BIP2. This includes writing a detailed document or white paper that outlines the proposed changes. The BIP should be comprehensive, covering motivation, technical specifications, and rationale. Discussion and Feedback: Once the BIP is drafted, it\u2019s shared with the Bitcoin community for discussion and feedback and usually happens on platforms like the Bitcoin Dev mailing list, GitHub, and even Twitter. The purpose is to solicit feedback, refine the proposal, and begin to build consensus around it. Assigning a BIP Number: If the BIP is deemed to have potential and is unique, it\u2019s assigned a BIP number by a BIP editor. This is a formal acknowledgment that the BIP is under consideration. Formal Review: After the BIP is assigned a number, it enters a formal review phase. During this time, the BIP is scrutinized for technical soundness, feasibility, and compatibility with the Bitcoin protocol. This is where the devs try to break the bip and poke holes in the proposal. Revisions: Based on feedback and review, the BIP may undergo several revisions. Implementation: Once consensus is reached, the BIP is implemented in the Bitcoin Core codebase. This step involves actual coding and rigorous testing to ensure that the changes work as intended without introducing new vulnerabilities. Reaching Consensus: For a BIP to move forward, it needs to reach consensus among the Bitcoin development community. This is often the most challenging part, as Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature means that a wide range of stakeholders (developers, miners, users, etc.) need to agree on the change. Deployment: After implementation & consensus, the new version of Bitcoin Core including the BIP is released. Depending on the nature of the BIP, it might require a majority of miners or nodes to upgrade to the new version for the changes to take full effect. Activation: Finally, once the required threshold of network participants has adopted the new version, the changes proposed in the BIP are activated on the Bitcoin network. Reading through this is incredibly helpful in understanding how change happens to Bitcoin. The problem I see is where are the single point of failures in this process and who the gatekeepers2 are for each step. Conversations happening in channels now are surfacing weak points or non documented parts of the development cycle. For example, Bitcoin Inquisition. This is the in space between steps 2 and 3. Bitcoin Inquisition Bitcoin Inquisition is a non-documented part of the Bitcoin development process. It was proposed by and administered by AJ Towns in 2022. Here is a very brief summary of why and what it is. \u201cI think the weakest link in that [bitcoin development] loop is the first one: what if we did activate soft forks on the default signet prior to the code being merged into core? To that end, I\u2019m proposing a fork of core that I\u2019m calling \u201cbitcoin-inquisition\u201d, with the idea that it branches from stable releases of core and adds support for proposed changes to consensus (CTV, ANYPREVOUT, TLUV, OP_CAT, etc\u2026) and potentially also relay policy (relay changes are often implied by consensus changes, but also potentially things like package relay).\u201d \u2013 AJ Towns on Bitcoin Inquisition The reality is that the Bitcoin Inquisition is live and well. AJ runs a special separate fork of Bitcoin core and acts as the sole admin for testing BIP\u2019s. This is not documented in BIP-2, but has just been accepted as process by core devs. This is a curious development of how tribal devs can make changes how they see fit, without documentation. The Bitcoin Sabotage At this point we\u2019ve run through the roles in Bitcoin, the steps in the development process, and even identified a glaring hole in the development process. Let\u2019s now dig into what is sabotage. Sabotage. (noun) /ˈsæb.ə.tɑːʒ/ Definition: The deliberate destruction, damage, or obstruction of something, typically for political or military advantage. Sabotage is often carried out covertly and with the intention of hindering operations, activities, or plans of an opponent or competitor. Verb Form: Sabotage (sabotaging, sabotaged) Usage in a Sentence: \u201cThe bridge collapse was found to be the result of sabotage by enemy agents.\u201d For purpose of this article, let\u2019s frame sabotage specifically in relation to Bitcoin Sabotage. Bitcoin Sabotage is the deliberate destruction of Bitcoin, or obstruction of Bitcoin development or adoption, for political advantage. This is the frame. This is what we are up against. With that in mind let\u2019s now dig into how sabotage is waged. Conveniently our very own CIA is masters at sabotage and have been waging sabotage tactics in warfare for over a century. Simple Sabotage Field Manual In the 1940\u2019s, the CIA shipped a field manual called Simple Sabotage Field Manual. The purpose of this was to distribute to operators a practical manual on how to conduct sabotage operations behind enemy lines. While this manual is 80 years old, it reveals some classical tactics in the art of sabotage. Click here to download your Spook handbook today! This \u201cSimple Sabotage\u201d is a unique look at how sly the military is when it comes to unconventional warfare. This manual was developed in the 1940\u2019s and you have to wonder how many more hours and resources have gone into modernizing this same document and other classified operators manuals. For purpose of this article, we will examine the Specific Suggestions for Sabotage sections focused on Organizations and Conferences & Managers and Supervisors. Organizations and Conferences Insist on doing everything through \u201cchannels.\u201d Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions. Make \u201cspeeches,\u201d Talk as frequently as possible and at great length., Illustrate your points by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate patriotic\u201d comments. When possible, refer all matters to committees, for \u201cfurther study and consideration.\u201d Attempt to make the committees as large as possible \u2013 never less than five. Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible. Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions. Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision. Advocate \u201ccaution.\u201d Be unreasonable\u201d and urge your fellow-conferees to be \u201creasonable\u201d and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on. Be worried about the propriety of any decision \u2013 raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated Hes within the jurisdiction of the group 01\u2019whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon. When I read Section A. Organizations and Conferences, I can\u2019t help but think that Bitcoin development is being sabotaged, but I am a naive outsider. I am also a noticer. If I was going to sabotage Bitcoin, this field manual could easily be deployed from within developer circles. If you were a state operator with developing skills, it is reasonable to believe you could begin participating in code review process and make in roads and start having authority in matters. Let\u2019s outline sabotage tactics state operators could be executing: Miners \u2013 in the great blocksize wars, some large mining pools signaled with the Big Blockers. This was an attack on Bitcoin, but it demonstrates a specific action that Mining Pool operators could carry out in order to sabotage Bitcoin. While this DID NOT work in breaking Bitcoin, we learned that Users are at the heart of Bitcoin. A bigger problem could be if large pool operators were acting in coordination with other roles. Devs \u2013 this is perhaps the biggest vector for sabotage attack. As we see more value soaked up by Bitcoin, it will become a bigger target for state actors. That means we will have state operators submitting pull requests and participating in the development process. Based on the Simple Sabotage Field Manual, operators could easily carry out many of the tactics outlined above. We are already seeing very divisive positions from developers on how bitcoin should be, so you must wonder who is the operator. Users \u2013 since users give feedback to developers, you would assume that giving bad feedback could lead to developers building something that is not in bitcoins best interest. Or users could socially attack developers into doing certain things. Right now we are seeing meme warfare being waged within the maximalist community, and it can\u2019t all be organic discourse. Users infighting can lead to maldevelopment. Also, what happens if a group of bad actors in the users and developers camps are aligned. Or what if users coordinate to influence certain developers? Economic Nodes \u2013 they choose what transactions make it to miners via the code they run. Users tell them what code to run because users spend money with them. Economic nodes could sabotage by supporting old code, or malicious sabotaged code. In wrapping up this piece, the complex dynamics between miners, devs, users, and economic nodes within Bitcoin creates a ripe battle ground for meme warfare and Bitcoin Sabotage. The Bitcoin development process is without flaws and as outlined in the CIA\u2019s Simple Sabotage Field Manual, there are many simple to deploy tactics that could be used to sabotage Bitcoin. This should serve as a sobering reality that Bitcoin is under attack and you should act accordingly. The responsibility is on you, humble frog, to keep your head on a swivel. You must stay aware and call out bullshit. Whether it is combating gaslighting, carrying out ethical trolling, or reviewing code, all these actions count and help preserve our only realistic shot at a more free future. The survival and flourishing of Bitcoin depend not just on NGU and its technological robustness but equally on the collective vigilance the users. As we navigate these uncertain times, let us be guided commitment to cypherpunk ethos, critical thinking, and unwavering support for the core principles that underpin Bitcoin which is freedom. In doing this, we might have a chance at winning the game of Bitcoin Sabotage and defeating our enemy, the state.","article_summary":"How would you go about sabotaging Bitcoin if you were a government agent?","creation_date":"Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:00:00 GMT","associated_tags":["Simple Sabotage Field Manual","Opinion","Government Sabotage","Culture","bitcoin development"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-sabotage-of-bitcoin","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin Surpasses $61,000 As New All Time High Approaches","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Nik Hoffman"},"article_detailed_content":"Bitcoin surged past the $61,000 mark today, edging closer to a new all-time high as spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and investor enthusiasm continues to drive up prices.

Grayscale\u2019s latest amendment includes a correlation analysis conducted by Coinbase as evidence of sufficient market correlation. Coinbase found that the CME ETH futures market has been \u201cconsistently and highly correlated\u201d with the spot Ethereum market for roughly the past three years. The rate is higher than the correlation that the SEC found between the CME Bitcoin futures market and the spot Bitcoin market.

It accordingly states that authorized participants cannot purchase, hold, deliver, or receive ETH. According to the filing, Grayscale Ethereum Trust now holds $11.8 billion in assets under management (AUM) instead of $4.8 billion of AUM.

The sector soared past $10 billion in mid-February, buoyed by Bittensor\u2019s remarkable climb to a $4 billion market cap with an increase of over 220% in 2024. By March, the sector had exploded to over $25 billion in market cap. Top AI coins surge in 2024 (Source: TradingView) Around March 9, several projects hit new all-time highs, including Bittensor, Fetch, OriginTrail, Worldcoin, and Arkham, pushing the market cap close to $30 billion. In the past few days, the sector has cooled to below $25 billion in market cap as investors seem to be taking profits after a potentially overheated market surge. While Bitcoin has also dipped, as of press time, it sits just 6% below its all-time high, while the top 10 AI crypto projects are mostly down over 20%. Top 10 AI coins Interestingly, many AI crypto coins have not recently been as closely correlated with Bitcoin as the rest of the market. Bittensor and Fetch, specifically have seemingly been treading their own course, moving down only when Bitcoin has made substantial moves. Even then, the coins often had a delayed reaction or moved against Bitcoin. Fetch increased 140% in four days since March 6 before slightly retracing approximately 20%. Across the board, since the sector\u2019s peak on March 9, Fetch is down 4%, ICP is down 11%, The Graph is down 12%, Singularity is down 13%, and Bittensor is down 12.8%. Top AI coins fall in past days (Source: TradingView) While the rise of AI in 2023 saw an influx of new AI-related memecoins and hype projects, those currently sitting toward the top of the sector chart are primarily focused on real-life implementation of decentralized AI tooling. The work has attracted the attention of Ethereum\u2019s Vitalik Buterin, Erik Voorhees, and other notable players in the crypto space. The importance of decentralized AI models likely aligns with that of decentralized finance as the progress of AI development continues to ramp up. Blockchain and tokenization appear solid bedfellows for a distributed AI network, indicating the recent retracement is possibly profit-taking rather than investors losing faith in the burgeoning sector. However, with such rapid gains, it is also likely that investors will be eager to see progress in delivering technology. Many of the top progress have live mainnets with projects actively building. The critical next step is to see whether a network effect can bring users on chain to engage with this fascinating cross-section of AI and blockchain. Bittensor, for one, is undoubtedly seeing demand for adoption as the cost to register one of its 32 subnets has risen from around $200,000 to over $5 million this month alone, with the price set by market forces rather than any centralized entity.

Too volatile Buckley said that Vanguard does not intend to change its stance toward the spot Bitcoin ETFs, primarily because it does not believe they belong in long-term and retirement portfolios. He added: \u201cSomething like bitcoin is just too volatile and it\u2019s not a store of value \u2014 it hasn\u2019t been\u2026 It is speculative, really tough to think about how it belongs in a long-term portfolio.\u201d The Vanguard CEO said that Bitcoin prices recently fell alongside stock prices, and it is difficult to predict the flagship crypto\u2019s growth. These factors make it difficult to determine how to include Bitcoin ETFs in portfolios. Buckley said the firm focuses on investing in asset classes with underlying cash flows, such as stocks or bonds, which are easier to value and model. Buckley plans to retire before the end of 2024 but his departure is unlikely to change Vanguard\u2019s stance as the beliefs are part of the firm\u2019s investment philosophy. Vanguard\u2019s past complaints Vanguard previously confirmed that it would not offer access to spot Bitcoin ETFs shortly after the funds gained approval in January 2024. The company commented more extensively on its concerns later in the month and said that Bitcoin was an \u201cimmature asset class.\u201d Vanguard\u2019s Global Head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker and Index Relations, Janel Jackson, notably commented that crypto \u201ccan create havoc within a portfolio\u201d due to its short history and lack of inherent value and cash flow. Meanwhile, the firm\u2019s Head of Brokerage & Investments, Andrew Kadjeski, explained that the firm aims to serve long-term, buy-and-hold investors. The company\u2019s history of avoiding short-term market trends, including steering clear of internet funds in the 1990s and removing access to leveraged and inverse funds and ETFs in 2019 and over-the-counter stocks in 2022, illustrates a historic strategy of prioritizing long-term stability over short-term gains. Vanguard\u2019s stance has generated significant discussion within the investment community, with some clients expressing frustration over the firm\u2019s reluctance to include Bitcoin in its investment offerings.

Bloomberg drew attention to the silent change in a March 15 report, which revealed that Binance Labs had added a disclaimer about the change on its website earlier in the year. Based on snapshots from Archive.org, the venture firm added the disclaimer in late February: \u201cBinance Labs is an independent venture and not part of the Binance Group nor is it involved in any of the businesses operated by the Binance Group (including but not limited to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange).\u201d The spin-off is one of the most significant decisions made under the exchange\u2019s new CEO, Richard Teng, since taking over four months ago. He previously headed the exchange\u2019s Singapore division and has no publicly listed role at Binance Labs. The companies did not respond to a request for comment as of press time, and the reasons behind the decision to split the venture capital division are unclear. Licensing the brand Binance Labs Investment Director Alex Odagiu told Bloomberg that the venture capital firm operates independently but will continue to use the Binance brand name under a licensing agreement. Despite its newfound independence, Binance Labs remains dedicated to its foundational mission of discovering and investing in promising crypto projects. Odagiu reaffirmed the commitment, stressing that the venture\u2019s focus on supporting innovation within the blockchain ecosystem remains unchanged. The separation entails distinct contractual agreements for Binance Labs staff, mirroring the organizational structure seen in other Binance-supported entities such as the BNB Chain. Bloomberg identified the value of Binance Labs as close to $10 billion. The company\u2019s website indicates that it has supported more than 200 crypto projects over six years. Its portfolio notably includes the top-twenty market cap blockchain Polygon, the metaverse-focused platform The Sandbox, and the decentralized finance platform CurveFi. Binance reshuffled leadership This strategic pivot comes in the wake of Binance\u2019s recent settlement with US regulatory bodies, culminating in a hefty $4.3 billion fine and the replacement of its founder, Changpeng Zhao, with Teng as CEO. The reorganization appears to be part of a broader strategy to navigate the post-settlement landscape, ensuring compliance and operational resilience. Under the leadership of Binance co-founder Yi He, Binance Labs has emerged as a pivotal force in the crypto venture capital arena. Funded primarily through the exchange\u2019s profits, it has established itself as a key player, supporting approximately 250 projects, including notable names like Sky Mavis, Aptos Labs, and Polygon.

The US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York filed a sentencing memorandum detailing SBF\u2019s wide-ranging fraudulent activities on March 15. According to the filing, his malpractices not only undermined the integrity of the financial and political systems but also left tens of thousands of victims across several continents grappling with significant losses. Greed and ambition The government\u2019s filing paints a picture of SBF as a figure driven by unparalleled greed and ambition, whose actions reached into the political arena through unlawful contributions and even extended overseas with attempts to bribe Chinese government officials. Beyond the financial deceit at FTX and Alameda Research, a trading firm he founded, SBF was also involved in banking misconduct, including operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and misleading banks to facilitate his operations. In the aftermath of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, SBF attempted to deflect blame and evade responsibility, further complicating the legal proceedings and highlighting a persistent refusal to acknowledge the scope of his wrongdoing. The prosecutors also outlined instances of obstruction of justice, including his use of encrypted messaging to delete evidence and tampering with witnesses. Extraordinary punishment for extraordinary crimes The request for a 40 to 50-year sentence emphasizes the severity of SBF\u2019s actions and reflects the prosecution\u2019s stance on the need for a punishment that matches the extraordinary impact of his crimes. The memorandum argues that such a sentence is necessary not only to provide justice for the victims but also to serve as a deterrent against similar crimes in the rapidly evolving crypto sector. In addition to the prison term, the government is seeking forfeiture of assets acquired through the criminal activities and has proposed victim compensation through remission as an alternative to traditional restitution. This approach aims to address the financial harm suffered by the victims, some of whom lost their life savings in the collapse of FTX. SBF\u2019s sentencing is set for March 28, marking a pivotal moment in bringing justice to the thousands of FTX customers who were wronged.

Public trackers like Nayibtracker and Bitcoin Treasuries had previously placed the nation\u2019s holdings at 2864 BTC, estimated at $193 million. Nonetheless, the sizable treasury aligns with recent revelations by Bukele, who highlighted multiple revenue streams beyond mere acquisition. These include BTC earnings from citizenship sales, currency exchanges for local businesses, mining activities, and other undisclosed government services. Moreover, President Bukele has consistently reiterated El Salvador\u2019s commitment to holding onto its Bitcoin reserves, signaling a steadfast dedication to its crypto strategy for the long term. Donations and praises Following Bukele\u2019s revelation, crypto enthusiasts praised the country\u2019s move and swiftly began sending small amounts of BTC and rare Ordinals to the wallet. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, said no other country has a bright trajectory like El Salvador while highlighting the country\u2019s security, growth, economy, and talent.

Altcoin Market To Rally Toward $425 Billion Since Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, many cryptocurrency analysts anticipate a surge in the altcoin market cap. Rekt Capital, a cryptocurrency expert and trader, has shared a positive prediction regarding the altcoins market cap with the community on X. The expert analysis delves into the current state of the market and its potential to surge higher in the coming months. His projections came in light of the altcoin season index showing advancement, which suggests that its season is almost here. According to the analyst, the market has been \u201credirected into the blue-circled testing area,\u201d which was caused by rejection from the \u201cred-circled circle zone.\u201d However, the market has rebounded since then, indicating an increased interest from market investors. Furthermore, Rekt Capital noted that the market has surpassed the \u201c$315 billion red line of resistance.\u201d As a result, the red line resistance level has now been changed to a \u201cnew support level.\u201d Due to this, the crypto analyst anticipates a surge to the \u201clight blue circle\u201d at the $425 billion threshold in the upcoming months. The post read: The red-circled area rejected the Altcoin Market back into the blue-circled retesting zone. Since then, the Altcoin Market Cap has recovered, broken beyond the red $315bn resistance, and turned recently into new support. Next is the light blue circle, over time. However, Rekt Capital also asserted in another recent post that the \u201c$315 billion mark is still being retested by alts market cap new support.\u201d It has been unable to move past it despite today\u2019s double-digit declines on several altcoins. Even though the market is still retesting the aforementioned level, Rekt Capital is confident that it will \u201crevisit the $425 billion resistance\u201d soon. He anticipates the market revisiting the level before the Bitcoin Halving event, expected to take place in April. Alts Gains Are Sustable And Likely To Crash Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Bitcoin technology firm JAN3, Samson Mow, has also shared his insights regarding the altcoin market. Despite anticipating a rise in the altcoin market, Mow highlighted that he expects alts to \u201ccrash in the upcoming weeks.\u201d According to Mow, alts have been monitoring the \u201cincrease in Bitcoin\u201d after launching BTC Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). However, altcoins do not possess \u201cthe $500 million to $1 billion\u201d daily inflows seen with Bitcoin.

Rekt Capital, a cryptocurrency expert and trader, has shared a positive prediction regarding the altcoins market cap with the community on X. The expert analysis delves into the current state of the market and its potential to surge higher in the coming months. His projections came in light of the altcoin season index showing advancement, which suggests that its season is almost here. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Projects $7 Trillion Market Cap For Altcoins \u2013 Here\u2019s When According to the analyst, the market has been \u201credirected into the blue-circled testing area,\u201d which was caused by rejection from the \u201cred-circled circle zone.\u201d However, the market has rebounded since then, indicating an increased interest from market investors. Furthermore, Rekt Capital noted that the market has surpassed the \u201c$315 billion red line of resistance.\u201d As a result, the red line resistance level has now been changed to a \u201cnew support level.\u201d Due to this, the crypto analyst anticipates a surge to the \u201clight blue circle\u201d at the $425 billion threshold in the upcoming months. The post read: The red-circled area rejected the Altcoin Market back into the blue-circled retesting zone. Since then, the Altcoin Market Cap has recovered, broken beyond the red $315bn resistance, and turned recently into new support. Next is the light blue circle, over time. However, Rekt Capital also asserted in another recent post that the \u201c$315 billion mark is still being retested by alts market cap new support.\u201d It has been unable to move past it despite today\u2019s double-digit declines on several altcoins. Even though the market is still retesting the aforementioned level, Rekt Capital is confident that it will \u201crevisit the $425 billion resistance\u201d soon. He anticipates the market revisiting the level before the Bitcoin Halving event, expected to take place in April. Alts Gains Are Sustable And Likely To Crash Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Bitcoin technology firm JAN3, Samson Mow, has also shared his insights regarding the altcoin market. Despite anticipating a rise in the altcoin market, Mow highlighted that he expects alts to \u201ccrash in the upcoming weeks.\u201d Related Reading: Altcoin Market Cap Break From \u201cWyckoff Accumulation Phase\u201d: Will Ethereum, XRP Fly? According to Mow, alts have been monitoring the \u201cincrease in Bitcoin\u201d after launching BTC Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). However, altcoins do not possess \u201cthe $500 million to $1 billion\u201d daily inflows seen with Bitcoin. Consequently, this should be the \u201cmajor sign\u201d that their gains \u201ccan not\u201d be maintained. \u201cMSTR has a $30 billion market cap, Solana is $73 billion. That is absurd.

This trend is most prominent in the data for the 2017 bull run when the price retested this level several times. An interesting pattern that has been held is that these retests of the level during bull trends have generally resulted in the cryptocurrency finding support and turning itself back around. The explanation for this trend may lie in the fickle nature of the STHs. The cost basis is an important level for these investors, and when a retest of it happens, they panic and show some reaction. During uptrends, these holders are more likely to buy more when a retest of their cost basis occurs since they may think that the same price levels that were profitable earlier will be so again in the near future.

The explanation for this trend may lie in the fickle nature of the STHs. The cost basis is an important level for these investors, and when a retest of it happens, they panic and show some reaction.

Naturally, it\u2019s not a certainty that Bitcoin would also end up retesting this level in this bull market. Still, a correction might reach close to it if the historical precedent is anything to go by. BTC Price Following its 7% drop in the past day, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,700.

The AI model has disclosed three potential price targets for SHIB by the end of 2024. SHIB Price Outlook By End Of The Year Gemini, Google\u2019s most capable AI model has predicted the price of SHIB to surge by the end of 2024. According to the chat bot, Shiba Inu could potentially witness a massive rally, pushing it to new all-time highs during this time line. Sharing three distinct scenarios where Shiba Inu is set to experience a significant price rally, Gemini disclosed that SHIB could break past key resistance levels to surge to $0.0002, shedding off a zero from its current price and reflecting a massive 410% surge. In the second price outlook, the AI chatbot predicts that the price of SHIB could witness a surge to $0.0001. This price increase would require SHIB to rally by at least 155%, taking advantage of market\u2019s bullish trends and investor sentiment to push its price upwards. The third and final price outlook by Google\u2019s Gemini reveals a more moderate price increase for SHIB. According to the AI model, SHIB\u2019s price is expected to surge to $0.00005 by December 2024. This price increase depicts a relatively low growth for the cryptocurrency, potentially signaling impending bearish trends in the future. Shiba Inu Witnesses Major Price Correction Since the beginning of the year, the price of SHIB has been on an upward momentum, amassing significant gains that has further solidified its position in the crypto industry. The cryptocurrency has also garnered a considerable amount of interest from both investors and traders, successfully rising to the world\u2019s top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Despite various crypto analysts predicting that SHIB will maintain its bullish trajectory, the cryptocurrency has been witnessing unexpected price declines lately. The price of SHIB experienced a significant drop below $0.00003, trading at $0.000029 at the time of writing, and reflecting a steep decline of 10.75% in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency had previously experienced a price increase of approximately 205.66% over the past month. However, it seems bearish trends may be taking over, as SHIB has been displaying mostly red candle sticks on its weekly price charts, according to CoinMarketCap. While the reason for this unexpected price drop has not yet been determined, Shiba Inu is still on a relatively bullish path, which is evident in its previous price performance over the past few months. Moreover, Shiba Inu\u2019s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, has also remained bullish on the doggy-themed meme coin, predicting that SHIB could potentially become the leading cryptocurrency in the upcoming meme coin season.","article_summary":"Google Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot Gemini has provided key insights into the future price trajectory of Shiba Inu.

Citing the recent defeat of Democratic Representative Katie Porter in California\u2019s Senate primary as evidence, the digital asset industry points to its significant financial backing and influence on elections. With sympathetic billionaires and a well-funded pro-crypto super political action committee (PAC), the industry aims to shape the political landscape in favor of cryptocurrency-friendly candidates. Industry Giants Pour $10M Into Securing Pro-Crypto Nominees Rich industry players have reportedly contributed $10 million to advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts that allegedly helped defeat Katie Porter in the open primary. That outcome paved the way for fellow Democrat Adam Schiff, perceived as more pro-crypto, to secure the nomination, the report noted. According to the report, the lobby plans to use Porter\u2019s loss as an example to pressure other vulnerable Democratic allies, warning that aligning with crypto critic Senator Elizabeth Warren could make their reelection campaigns more difficult. Digital asset advocates have reportedly garnered significant financial support from sympathetic billionaires and industry leaders. The pro-crypto Super PAC, Fairshake, has amassed a \u201cwar chest\u201d of approximately $75 million for use in the US elections. Notable backers include Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Gemini exchange founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz. With significant resources, the lobby aims to influence political outcomes and promote candidates who support the industry\u2019s interests. Balancing Innovation And Regulation The digital asset industry faces legislative proposals to combat illicit finance, with some bills seeking to apply anti-money laundering rules to crypto firms. Groups like the Blockchain Association and the Chamber of Digital Commerce argue that such requirements would be \u201cunworkable\u201d and potentially \u201cfatal\u201d for the industry in the US. While criminal networks have exploited cryptocurrencies for illicit activities, the industry emphasizes the need for balanced regulation that addresses concerns without stifling innovation. Bloomberg observes that the crypto industry\u2019s growing political influence represents a significant shift from when it faced scandals and business failures a year ago. Despite regulatory scrutiny and challenges in establishing practical use cases for the technology, the industry has rebounded and now wields financial clout. Lawmakers recognize the industry\u2019s ability to pour millions of dollars into races, making it a force to be reckoned with in the political arena.

Interestingly, his theory revolved around the foremost meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), which he believes could attract non-crypto natives back into the crypto space. Dogecoin\u2019s Role In Attracting Mainstream Demand For Crypto Melker mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that mainstream FOMO (fear of missing out) will return to the crypto market when the foremost meme coin hits a new all-time high (ATH). His belief is based on the fact that \u201cmainstream fervor\u201d in the last bull cycle was driven by dog coins and NFTs (non-fungible tokens). He alluded to how these individuals joined waiting lists on exchanges just to sign up and buy DOGE. As such, DOGE needs to make a similar run to the one in 2021 to attract these people back into the space and get them \u201cexcited about the market again.\u201d DOGE hitting a new ATH would be a good start since it would put all investments from the previous cycle in profits. Melker suggested that Bitcoin hitting new ATHs hasn\u2019t been sufficient enough to attract this class of investors as there is still \u201cseemingly minimal mainstream interest.\u201d He joked that he has so far not gotten calls from old friends and family asking if they should buy Bitcoin. Although DOGE isn\u2019t exactly at the center of this bull cycle, meme coins are once again part of the leading narratives, with these crypto tokens gaining much interest from retail investors. However, there is the feeling that DOGE could draw a lot of attention once it makes a parabolic rise that causes it to hit a new ATH. What Dogecoin Needs For A New ATH In 2021, DOGE surged by over 26,000% to hit an ATH of $0.7376. This price surge was partly due to the broader acceptance the meme coin began to enjoy, with entities like the NBA team Dallas Mavericks accepting it as a payment option. Therefore, an increase in DOGE\u2019s use case could be critical for its performance in this bull run. Interestingly, DOGE\u2019s primary supporter and the world\u2019s richest man, Elon Musk, recently hinted that his company, Tesla, would eventually begin accepting the meme coin as a payment method. Such development would no doubt send bullish signals throughout the DOGE ecosystem and positively affect its price. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.1635, down over 12% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.","article_summary":"Crypto expert Scott Melker, also known as the \u2018Wolf of All Streets,\u201d has laid down a theory of when mainstream demand for crypto will return in this bull market.

This move comes amid a broader regulatory push within Hong Kong to oversee and regulate the crypto market. The SFC\u2019s cautionary note addresses 11 investment products by Bybit, indicating potential risks these might pose to investors. Despite Bybit\u2019s efforts to align with local regulations, including its Hong Kong entity, Spark Fintech Limited, applying for a crypto exchange license, the regulator\u2019s spotlight on Bybit underscores the challenging landscape of crypto regulation. Bybit Regulatory Hurdles And Compliance Efforts This alert by the SFC highlights a critical moment for Bybit, a crypto exchange with a global footprint, as it navigates the complexities of compliance within different jurisdictions. The identified \u201csuspicious\u201d products span various offerings, from futures and options to wealth management services, emphasizing the regulator\u2019s broad scrutiny. The SFC\u2019s statement clarifies that no entity within the Bybit group holds a license or registration to conduct regulated activities in Hong Kong. With the deadline for crypto trading platforms to submit license applications looming, the SFC\u2019s action serves as a reminder of the importance of compliance. Bybit\u2019s distinction between its international operations and the local entity, Spark Fintech Limited, reflects the complex nature of crypto regulations and platforms\u2019 efforts to adapt to diverse regulatory demands. The Broader Context Of Crypto Regulation In Hong Kong Notably, the Bybit regulatory hurdle comes at a time when Hong Kong\u2019s SFC shared a recent mandate that requires all crypto trading platforms within its jurisdiction to apply for a license by February 29 or risk being shut down by May 31. Meanwhile, as Hong Kong aims to position itself as a regulated stronghold for the crypto industry, it has attracted license applications from 24 entities eager to operate within the city. Among these applicants are prominent industry names like OKX, Crypto.com, and even Bybit, all vying for a chance to comply with the city\u2019s stringent regulations to safeguard investors. However, the regulatory framework\u2019s focus on investor protection comes with compliance costs that challenge some entities. Given these regulatory shifts, HTX, formerly Huobi Global, has retracted its application for a crypto exchange license in Hong Kong. This retreat marks a significant change in direction for HTX, which had previously expressed a strong desire to set up a regulated exchange in Hong Kong, backed by the support of TRON founder Justin Sun.

Bitcoin Has Registered A Drop Of 7% In The Last 24 Hours Right after setting a fresh all-time high (ATH) not too far from the $74,000 level, the Bitcoin price has reversed its trajectory sharply during the past day. The below chart shows how the digital asset has performed recently. As is visible in the graph, Bitcoin quickly recovered back towards the $72,400 mark midway through the crash, but the retrace was only temporary, as the coin soon resumed its drawdown and dived under the $67,000 level. Since this low, BTC has made a slight recovery back to $67,600, meaning that it has experienced a decline of almost 7% in the last 24 hours. As is often the case, Ethereum (ETH) and the altcoins have also followed in the lead of the original cryptocurrency, witnessing crashes of their own. With all this sharp price action around the market, forceful closure of contracts, or \u2018liquidations,\u2019 are bound to have piled up on the derivative side of the sector. Indeed, data confirms this. Crypto Derivative Market Has Seen $813 Million In Liquidations Today According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency derivative market has observed total liquidations amounting to a whopping $813 million during the past 24 hours. The table below shows the relevant numbers related to this latest liquidation flush. As displayed above, around $663 million of these liquidations involved long contracts, meaning that this side of the market contributed an overwhelming 81% of the total flush. This lines up with the price action, as assets across the sector have plunged during this period. Mass liquidation events like today\u2019s are popularly known as \u201csqueezes.\u201d In these events, liquidations cascade together like a waterfall and amplify the sharp price move that triggered them. As longs took most of the beating in the latest squeeze, it would be categorized as a \u201clong squeeze.\u201d As for how the various individual symbols contributed to this squeeze, the table below shows the data for this breakdown. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, are number one and two, respectively. Solana (SOL) is the altcoin with the largest amount of liquidations at $41 million. SOL is the only coin among the top assets that has managed strong positive returns during the last 24 hours, and it\u2019s also among the best performers for the past week. This strong performance may be why it has more speculative interest behind it than the other alts right now.","article_summary":"Data shows over $668 million in cryptocurrency long contracts have been squeezed following Bitcoin\u2019s crash under the $68,000 level.

The SEC\u2019s investigation revealed that the scheme relied primarily on funds from new investors to repay earlier investors, with only a fraction of the funds raised being used for actual trading activities. Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, said: In the end, the only thing that CryptoFX guaranteed was a trail of thousands upon thousands of victims stretching across ten states and two foreign countries. A scheme of that size requires lots of participants, and as today\u2019s action demonstrates, we will pursue charges against not just the principal architects of these massive schemes, but all those who further their fraud by unlawfully soliciting victims. The complaint alleges that the 17 individuals from Texas, California, Louisiana, Illinois, and Florida served as leaders within the CryptoFX network. They allegedly solicited investors by offering \u201cunrealistic returns\u201d ranging from 15 to 100 percent. Instead of utilizing the funds as promised, the defendants allegedly used them to pay returns to previous investors, provide commissions and bonuses to themselves and others involved, and finance their lifestyles. Defendants Accused Of Defying Court Orders The SEC\u2019s legal action also highlights the involvement of certain defendants in continuing to solicit investments even after court orders were issued to halt the CryptoFX scheme. Gabriel and Dulce Ochoa, for instance, are accused of instructing investors to retract their complaints to the SEC to recover their investments. Moreover, Maria Saravia allegedly misinformed investors, claiming the SEC\u2019s lawsuit was fake. The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas, charges various violations against the defendants, including antifraud, securities registration, broker-registration provisions, and whistleblower protection provisions. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties for each defendant. While two defendants, Luis Serrano and Julio Taffinder, have consented to the entry of final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations, the court\u2019s approval is pending. Serrano and Taffinder have agreed to pay over $68,000 combined in civil penalties, disgorgement, and interest.

The XRP community will no doubt have their eyes on this one and hope that the lawsuit, which has continued to mar the XRP ecosystem, can well be put in the past. The SEC and Ripple Set For Another Showdown Former Federal Prosecutor James Filan revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the SEC\u2019s opening brief is due on March 22, while Ripple will have until April 22 to file its opposition brief. Once that is done, the SEC\u2019s reply brief will follow with the deadline set for May 6. As noted by Filan, these dates form part of the revised schedule for the remedies briefing. The previous deadline for the SEC\u2019s opening brief was set for March 13. However, the Commission made a request to Judge Analisa Torres, seeking a one-week extension and citing \u201cgood cause\u201d as the reason why the request should be granted. Judge Torres subsequently granted the request. To avoid prejudice, the SEC also requested that Ripple\u2019s deadline to file its opposition brief be moved from April 12 to April 22 to give the defendants ample time to respond appropriately to the Commission\u2019s brief. This remedies briefing stage is a set-off from the discovery stage, where the regulator had requested certain documents from the crypto firm. These documents, which include post-complaint institutional sales contracts, will form the focal point of the SEC\u2019s opening brief. In it, the Commission will also make certain requests regarding the remedies that should be granted in its favor for Ripple\u2019s breach of securities laws. Judge Torres had previously ruled that the crypto firm\u2019s institutional sales were investment contracts. How The Remedies Briefing Could Go Alongside a monetary fine, the SEC is expected to request an injunction restraining Ripple from conducting institutional sales that are in breach of securities laws. On the other hand, Ripple will most likely contend what amount the Commission requests that it pays as a fine. There might also be contentions from Ripple that its ODL transactions do not classify as securities. Pro-XRP legal expert John Deaton had previously suggested that the remedies briefing might not be so straightforward as both parties might still have to file subsequent briefs. Deaton added that he doesn\u2019t foresee a judgment coming until late summer \u201cat the earliest.\u201d When the judgment is finally given, there is also the likelihood of an appeal from either (or both) parties.","article_summary":"The long-running legal battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple is set to once again gain steam as key dates approach.

Whale Buying 100 BTC Daily In a post on X, one user speculates that the whale likely belongs to a \u201csmall to medium nation-state\u201d that learned the lesson the \u201chard way.\u201d The user continues to say that the address might be looking to accumulate as many as possible since they want the \u201creal thing\u201d and not derivatives, including the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) some United States institutions offer. Since November 2023, a single wallet address, nicknamed \u201cMr. 100\u201d due to its consistent daily purchases of around 100 BTC, has been accumulating the world\u2019s most valuable coin. Because of this, there have been discussions to suggest that not only does the buyer have deep pockets, but there is a high likelihood that it is another country besides El Salvador. The theory behind a nation-state being behind \u201cMr. 100\u201d is rooted in a key advantage of Bitcoin: self-custody. Unlike traditional assets like gold, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t require a third-party custodian. This unique feature makes it attractive to nation-states, as it eliminates the risk of those assets being frozen or confiscated in case of political disagreements. Over the years, the United States government has sanctioned individuals, seizing assets and barring them from using the traditional financial rails, causing massive losses. However, unlike fiat, Bitcoin runs on a decentralized network, and transactions are immune to censorship, further enhancing its appeal to nation-states. More Whales Flocking To Bitcoin The pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin means the true holders of the whale account can only be deciphered if the owner publicly declares ownership. Already, the possibility of El Salvador controlling the wallet has been discounted. Early this week, El Salvador said they had moved their BTC holdings to a custodian in the country. Therefore, while the identity of \u201cMr. 100\u201d remains unknown, the potential of another nation-state accumulating Bitcoin introduces a captivating twist to the ongoing crypto adoption narrative. If anything, it only further legitimizes the asset class. It might encourage even more to follow the \u201cbuy-and-hold\u201d style that has seen early adopters rake in millions. Amid this speculation, Bitcoin is under pressure at press time, trading below the $70,000 level. However, this didn\u2019t prevent institutions from accumulating. Lookonchain data on March 14 shows that BlackRock bought $570 million worth of the coin, pushing their holding above 223,600 BTC.","article_summary":"A Bitcoin buying spree by an unknown address has not only piqued the interest of the crypto community but also sparked speculation that a sovereign state nation other than El Salvador might be accumulating the coin.

Convicted in November for orchestrating what prosecutors have termed one of the \u201cbiggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d Bankman-Fried\u2019s downfall is a tale of ambition gone awry, set against the backdrop of the cryptocurrency boom.

In contrast, Bankman-Fried\u2019s defense argues for leniency, suggesting a prison term of just over five to six years. They contend that most FTX clients will recover their lost funds and that Bankman-Fried did not intentionally set out to commit fraud. This defense, however, seems to falter against the weight of evidence presented during the trial.

Still, invaluable insights can be learned into what VCs look for in crypto startups. These include outlining a blueprint for entrepreneurs to refine their approach, focusing on timing, clarity, market understanding, team composition, and community engagement. Building the Perfect Pitch Danilo Carlucci, Founder and CEO of Morningstar Ventures, told BeInCrypto that timing is critical. Startups should engage VCs only when they have a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates their product\u2019s or service\u2019s feasibility and potential. This stage is crucial for eliciting initial interest and feedback from investors. Then, utilizing this feedback to refine the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allows startups to showcase tangible achievements and metrics, making a stronger case for investment. According to Carlucci, proper timing and iteration of these stages, evidenced by quantifiable success metrics, significantly impact the project\u2019s Future Diluted Valuation (FDV). \u201cTiming is such a difficult thing to get perfect. But if start-ups time their project stages correctly and iterate them, they can raise more funds, ultimately impacting their FDV,\u201d Carlucci said. He also emphasized the importance of clarity and conciseness in pitches. A successful pitch concisely articulates the problem being solved, the uniqueness of the solution, and the strategic use of capital. More importantly, clear go-to-market strategies and user acquisition plans are particularly compelling.

Incorporating on-chain metrics and market trends can further enhance a project\u2019s attractiveness by providing a clear picture of its potential. \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard it before. Less is more. As simple as it sounds, we value clear and concise pitches. Keep it short and sweet! Not only do VCs read through hundreds of pitches a week, but I firmly believe that the less time it takes to explain your project, the better it will be,\u201d Carlucci advice. Likewise, Samuel Huber, the CEO of Landvault and the Matera Protocol, told BeInCrypto that startups should pivot their focus toward hard metrics. These include profitability, burn rate, and capital efficiency, which are now paramount to investors. Even with the current enthusiasm in the crypto market, the broader economy will likely continue to adopt a cautious approach. The emphasis on real revenue generation cannot be overstated. In the flux of market cycles, where bull markets often prioritize growth at the expense of solid business foundations, bear markets shift the focus back to fundamental metrics like revenue. \u201cEntrepreneurs should shift their focus towards metrics that investors prioritize. Indeed, crypto startups need to demonstrate their ability to generate real revenue. They must focus on showcasing practical business models rather than solely emphasizing decentralization,\u201d Huber explained. The path to funding is fraught with challenges. \u201cThere\u2019s a tightening of funds for startups with unproven business models and poor execution,\u201d Huber noted. He emphasized the importance of demonstrating tangible business metrics over mere projections. This calls for a meticulous focus on building a solid business that stands out in a bear market. Tokenomics and the Dream Team Moreover, the team behind a project is a critical factor for VCs. Carlucci emphasized that VCs invest in people as much as in ideas. Therefore, a team\u2019s track record, complementarity, and vision are scrutinized. The team\u2019s openness to collaboration and feedback and a proactive approach significantly influence a VC\u2019s investment decision. In this regard, most VCs look for teams with a strong track record and extensive experience in their field. \u201cThe team is everything! No matter the tech, the design, or the idea, most VCs invest in people; therefore, the team and the vision of the founder is crucial,\u201d Carlucci said. Tokenomics and crypto narrative trends play a crucial role in attracting investment. Projects must design tokenomics that align VCs\u2019 interests with the project\u2019s long-term vision, ensuring a vested interest in the project\u2019s success. Likewise, entrepreneurs must align their projects with prevailing crypto narratives, striving to position themselves as leaders within these spaces. Despite the inherent risks in the crypto industry, Carlucci suggested that a well-articulated USP and comprehensive market analysis can address potential concerns and demonstrate the startup\u2019s awareness of and preparedness for challenges. Meanwhile, Huber highlighted the importance of utility and adaptability. \u201cGenerally, projects within infrastructure sectors are highly attractive to investors due to their potential for broader utility. While applications certainly create value, infrastructure projects influenced by narrative trends such as NFTs, the metaverse, DeFi, RWA, or the creator economy offer a foundation that can be leveraged by others, thereby enhancing their resilience,\u201d Huber added. Total Capital Raised by Sector. Source: The TIE Trust is also a critical factor in investment decisions. VCs prefer to back founders they know and trust, reflecting the importance of building a strong company and networking to enhance credibility. In Huber\u2019s view, the journey to securing VC funding in the crypto market is as much about showcasing resilience and innovation as it is about navigating the nuances of investor expectations and market dynamics. Indeed, Carlucci highlighted the importance of selecting the right VC partners. Startups should seek strategic partners offering more than capital, such as user access, networking opportunities, and industry expertise.

As the aforementioned instances make it clear that the altcoin will likely see more decline, it could see a fall to $0.606 and beyond. This would result in the Ripple token losing the crucial 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement support level and wiping out more than 90% of March\u2019s gains.

In a financial upturn, CCIP\u2019s fee revenue leaped from approximately $61,728 in January to an impressive $174,000 in the first half of March.

This new iteration, PancakeSwap v4, marks a significant advancement, promising enhanced flexibility, functionality, and efficiency. It aims to rectify the limitations of version 3 and redefine the standards for decentralized exchanges (DEXs). What Are the New Features of PancakeSwap V4? According to an announcement shared with BeInCrypto, PancakeSwap v4 is set for a third-quarter release on Ethereum and BNB Chain. It aims to offer a transformative trading experience. With open-source licensing, the DEX plans to foster collaboration and community contribution within the DeFi ecosystem, signaling a leap forward in blockchain technology. \u201cWe aim to foster the most comprehensive flexibility and functionality within the Automated Market Maker (AMM) space, built together by the Kitchen (PancakeSwap team) and DeFi developers in the crypto community. Hence, the PancakeSwap v4 code will be released under an open-source license,\u201d Chef Mochi, Head of PancakeSwap, said.\u201d Notably, PancakeSwap v4 introduces hooks. These are external contracts that augment liquidity pool functionalities. Hooks facilitate dynamic fee adjustments, the integration of custom oracles, and more, thereby granting developers unprecedented customization and control. Read more: How To Use PancakeSwap: A Step-By-Step Guide Additionally, the platform supports various pool types, including Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLAMM) and Liquidity Book. Moreover, PancakeSwap v4 introduces Flash Accounting. This feature consolidates all pools into a single contract, slashing deployment costs by 99%. It also reduces gas expenses for multi-hop swaps, enhancing the platform\u2019s efficiency and user appeal. In contrast, another DEX leader \u2013 Uniswap, integrated similar features earlier this year. This move indicates a broader industry trend towards more flexible and efficient DeFi platforms. However, PancakeSwap\u2019s approach in version 3, which involved forking Uniswap\u2019s code, sparked controversy last year. It highlighted the industry\u2019s struggle with innovation. \u201cWe keep up with the latest advancements in the AMM space, alongside a number of our own unique enhancements, to ensure users have access to the best DEX available,\u201d Chef Mochi explained BeInCrypto. Amid these strategic developments, the native token of PancakeSwap, CAKE, shows signs of an impending surge. Technical analysis points to a bullish cup and handle pattern on the weekly charts, suggesting a potential 300% increase to approximately $17.

The promise of significant profits exists, but the challenges of fluctuating regulations and the potential for dramatic price changes categorize digital currencies as a high-risk investment. But what if you could mitigate the risk and safeguard your initial capital investment in all market conditions? This is where AlgosOne, a new AI trading algorithm leveraging the latest developments in generative AI, comes in. This regulated AI trading tool not only aims to deliver substantial returns on investments but does so with a commitment to security, aiming to protect the initial capital investment under various market conditions. Remarkably, access to this advanced technology is offered at no cost. Automating Everything One of the main differentiators between AlgosOne and other institutional-calibre artificial intelligence based Bitcoin and Ethereum trading tools is that it is completely hands-off. There\u2019s no coding, strategy formulation, research, analysis, or risk management. AlgosOne picks the asset, position size, trade direction, and entry and exit times. It also automatically implements risk mitigation with stop losses, take profits, hedging, and more. You just sign up, deposit, then sit back and earn a passive profit. Reducing Exposure When Bitcoin, Smart Unidirectional Investment (SUI), or Ethereum trading, you want to safeguard your capital as best as you can. One of the primary ways in which AlgosOne achieves this is by combining the strengths of game-changing machine-learning technology and human experience and expertise. This ensures you are not handing over full control of your crypto to a machine. Professional risk management teams are tracking the market and trading system performance around the clock to shield against instances of flawed data or bias skewing the algorithm\u2019s decision-making and cases of extreme market upheaval that might require human intervention. AlgosOne also protects your capital by adhering to regulatory requirements. Fully licensed and authorised, AlgosOne segregates client and company funds, implements KYC and AML identity verification procedures, and protects against hacks with strict technological security protocols. In compliance with the toughest regulations, it also maintains a reserve fund with a sufficient balance to cover all client account capital in case of a breach, a technical failure, company or market collapse. Adherence to regulation also means accounts are never overleveraged. AlgosOne\u2019s deep-learning capabilities mean that it learns as it goes, improving its ability to optimise risk-adjusted returns with every additional trade, user, and dataset. The algorithm uses a range of different statistically validated techniques and AI-driven investment strategies to automatically mitigate exposure on every trade, including: Offsetting risk with hedging strategies Diversifying portfolios with a range of asset classes Automating stops and limits Avoiding overexposure with caps on trade size Providing compensation for losing trades Generating Profits Let\u2019s face it, the main factor determining your satisfaction with any AI trading tool is its capacity to generate profits, and this is precisely where AlgosOne excels. Obviously, there is no such thing as an investment guarantee or a Bitcoin trading solution that gets it right on every single trade, but over the long run, AlgosOne has proven its ability to hit its targets and offset any short-term losses throughout its trading contracts. For each trading tier, which is based on deposit size, AlgosOne publishes an anticipated profit percentage bracket, which it has consistently been able to meet or exceed, and the profits are far and away the highest offered by any competitor in the space. In addition, the company has just completed a major upgrade, which has involved expanding and diversifying the algorithm\u2019s datasets, as well as improving its ability to detect high-probability opportunities and evaluate risk potential with greater precision while increasing its access to top-quality live data. Eliminating Costs AlgosOne is also guaranteeing that your initial Bitcoin trading investment is protected by means of its fee structure. AlgosOne traders do not pay any subscription, account maintenance, deposit, or transaction fees. With no spreads eating into your principal, all your balance goes towards generating a profit. There is only one fee, a 20% commission, which is only charged on winning trades. The core, original investment isn\u2019t eroded since it only comes out of successful trades. It\u2019s also worth keeping in mind that the money from commissions goes back into safeguarding your capital. Half goes towards platform operations, including 24/7 live support, technical maintenance, and risk management teams, while the other half pays out compensation for losing trades. AlgosOne is offering a highly advanced AI trading tool that mitigates crypto risk and optimizes profits for a rapidly growing global client base. To test drive the system, without funds to a 12-month contract, sign up via the app, any time, for a 2-week commitment-free trial.

This is a change from the 2020 election, where 43% of owners recalled voting for Biden and 39% for Trump. How Crypto Could Swing US Elections Around 19% of voters hold or plan to invest in cryptocurrency, and around 11 million registered voters own more than $1000 worth of cryptocurrency. A little over a quarter of undergraduates, who comprised a notable portion of Trump\u2019s voter base in the primaries, also own crypto. Therefore, new and old crypto supporters could be crucial in the 2024 elections. This pivot towards Trump among crypto investors may be due to several factors. The Biden Administration\u2019s regulatory actions against certain crypto companies and activities may have alienated some investors.
