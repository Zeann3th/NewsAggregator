      "article_detailed_content": "Gaming has been a catalyst in resurrecting Web3 from a year-long winter. It\u2019s also a key force for mass adoption. Yet, the journey towards fully realizing the potential of Web3 gaming is fraught with challenges, notably the seamless integration of on-chain elements without sacrificing the core tenets of decentralization and player empowerment.\nNew users should only experience friction if necessary, and as late as possible. That\u2019s not the case with most existing Web3 games. From connecting their wallets upfront to signing transactions for verification, users face multiple hurdles before actually trying the game. These frictions contrast starkly with the vision of a seamless and accessible gaming world that fully on-chain gaming aspires to achieve.\nTitles such as Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties, though groundbreaking, fall short of being fully on-chain. Fully on-chain games store all game assets, mechanics, and states on the blockchain. This radical approach ensures unparalleled transparency, security, and player control, allowing for a truly decentralized gaming experience where players own and shape their digital destinies.\nRelated: Axie Infinity is toxic for crypto gaming\nBuilding the best game demands a functional, efficient combination of on-chain elements and the rich user experience of legacy titles.\nHolding Web3 games to Web2 standards is comparing apples to oranges. Their requirements, value propositions, and scopes differ greatly despite serving similar audiences.\nWeb3 games are meant to solve age-old problems like top-down models, lack of user control, and strong-arming by gaming corporations. That\u2019ll happen only by implementing alternative models, processes, and principles \u2014 not by emulating the outcomes achieved in Web2.\nWe can even argue that terms like \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201cseamless,\u201d and \u201chassle-free,\u201d will take on new meanings in this context, enhanced by other aspects like community orientation, real in-game value, and user-generated logic.\nTherefore, when building Web3 games, the most crucial requirement is to address novel challenges, ideally involving embracing innovative technologies and models that align with the principles of autonomy and community governance. It\u2019s about building \u201cAutonomous Worlds\u201d (AWs), a concept introduced in 2022 by Ludens \u2014 the founder of Lattice.xyz \u2014 to describe \u201ca world with a blockchain substrate.\u201d\nMoreover, new-age games must nurture and serve the expanding community of problem-aware gamers. Those who seek genuine solutions to the odds stacked against them in legacy gaming. Not mere bounty hunters and fleeting profit-mongers.\nBuilding fully on-chain games\nIronically, Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties served as pivotal catalysts in the evolution of blockchain gaming \u2014 but they weren't fully on-chain. They were experimental, niche, and heavily crypto-centric, characterized by their clunky user interfaces. Despite opening up new avenues, they weren\u2019t entirely \"Autonomous Worlds\" either. Users had little or no control over the rules and direction of the game, and only parts of the game states were on-chain.\nneed help my ship is stuck in the ░F░O░G░ pic.twitter.com/Hn6jn3NTOK\n\u2014 The Citadel (@0xCitadel) March 6, 2024\nDark Forest was the first decentralized real-time strategy game, released in 2020. Using zero-knowledge proofs (zkProofs), a cryptographic protocol, to create a \u201cfog of war\u201d in the gaming experience, this project set an example in building incomplete information games on-chain. For reference, think of games like poker, where players only see their hands and don\u2019t know what cards others have.\nThe challenge Dark Forest tackled was maintaining a publicly accessible distributed ledger without compromising the confidentiality of players' strategies \u2014 a fundamental aspect in any strategic gameplay.\nUsing zkProofs, Dark Forest maintained gameplay integrity and player privacy on a blockchain. This approach solved the critical issue of revealing sensitive game states (e.g., planet locations or attack trajectories), which is easily manageable with centralized servers but very challenging in decentralized environments. Dark Forest's solution set a precedent for real-time strategy gaming on the blockchain, providing a blueprint for future on-chain game development.\nThey even sparked the proliferation of community-oriented, bottom-up AWs: Mithraeum, Citadel, ZkHunt, and so on. Loot Project was another interesting addition to this space, letting users permissionlessly expand the IP and spawning hundreds of games, lores, etc.\nMithraeum. Source: Screenshot\nBy putting everything on-chain \u2014 from game states (assets, actions, etc.) to logic (rules of introduction, mechanisms for in-game interactions, etc.), AWs unlock flexible and resilient digital realities where users come of their own.\nGoing beyond in-game asset ownership, they incentivize players to attach greater significance to their on-chain gaming activities. More importantly, on-chain logic provides gamers with a meaningful say in what\u2019s legitimate and what\u2019s not in the game-world.\nThis is a massive departure from the status quo, where end-users are mostly passive consumers, playing at the whims and mercy of corporate publishers. Rules and norms emerge via community consensus, not the arbitrary will of external entities. And they serve grassroots interests. Players can build, contribute, monetize, and participate in ways that are impossible in Web2 games.\nRelated: Why Solana will prevail despite Ethereum ETFs\nThe empowering, skin-in-the-game nature of AWs instills a stronger desire for mastery in gamers. They\u2019re more driven to find creative solutions to solve problems and create mods and plugins to establish entirely separate economies within the game. This participatory fosters a deeper connection to the game, encouraging creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration within the community. For example, Dark Forest players have built a range of bots, plugins, and custom clients they can use to climb a leaderboard.\nAs we look to the future, the journey towards fully on-chain gaming is not without its challenges, yet the promise it holds is immense. By redefining engagement, ownership, and control within the digital realm, on-chain gaming is poised to offer experiences that more closely mirror real-world interactions and relationships. In doing so, it not only enhances the richness of virtual worlds but also establishes a new standard for what gaming can be\u2014truly immersive, empowering, and reflective of the players' desires and aspirations.\nThe principles of decentralization, player sovereignty, and community collaboration will be the guiding lights, shaping the future of gaming into an inclusive, democratic, and exciting digital frontier.\nFelix Xu is a co-founder and CEO of ARPA.

      "article_detailed_content": "Bank customers and the United States economy could lose opportunities if a poor approach is taken to regulating blockchain technology, U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) vice chair Travis Hill told an audience at the Mercatus Center think tank on March 11. The United States is already at risk, Hill said, and the FDIC shares the blame for that.\nTokenization of bank deposits and other real-world assets (RWA) could make it possible to carry out financial transaction at any time with real-time settlement, Hill said. In addition, it would provide programmability of payments, making it possible to conduct intraday repurchase (repo) exchanges and improve settlement times for some bond issuances and numerous other transactions. Consumers could also benefit from using programmable payments in place of escrow.\nAmong the many open questions about tokenization, Hill mentioned the use, or not, of unified ledgers, blockchain interoperability and ownership rights as assets move along the blockchain. Furthermore:\n\u201cGlobal standards are being established, directly or indirectly, and with many non-U.S. jurisdictions actively engaged in this area, the United States risks ceding influence at this critical stage.\u201d\nProgrammability could reduce settlement risks and Know Your Customer processes, but it could also allow consumers to move their assets quickly, aggravating bank runs. An \u201coff\u201d switch is needed to prevent that, Hill said.\nSource: @FDICgov on X\nRegulatory agencies attempted in the past to set consistent policies with little luck, so \u201cinstead, the agencies established processes under which institutions must engage with their regulator on an individual basis,\u201d Hill said.\nRelated: Inspector General wants FDIC to refine crypto risk assessment process, guidance\nLooking at FDIC regulations, which treat all transactions on a blockchain \u2014 whether they involve RWA or crypto \u2014 the same, Hill found them to be cumbersome and unequally applied:\n\u201cInstitutions have spent months responding to a long stream of information requests, diverting attention away from developing new technologies and systems. [\u2026] The message being heard by the vast majority of the industry could be interpreted as don't bother trying.\u201d\nGuidance is needed from regulators, as is consistency so that deposits in any form are treated the same, Hill said. He criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which requires financial institutions to treat crypto assets differently from any other kind of asset. The definition of crypto asset used in the bulletin is broad enough to include tokenized RWA, he said.\nMagazine: Block by block: Blockchain technology is transforming the real estate market\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest news in crypto legislation and regulations.

      "article_detailed_content": "Israel\u2019s central bank will support a new Israeli shekel central bank digital currency (CBDC) that has the option of bearing interest.\nIn the March 11 announcement, the Bank of Israel outlined that its shekel CBDC will be implemented in a two-tier model, with instant, 24/7 payments, multipayment support, offline use, limitations on balances and an option for the CBDC to become interest-bearing. The central bank wrote: \n\u201cIn the area of privacy, the architecture will allow the central bank, as the system administrator, to define the types of information required for the operation, control, and monitoring of the system. However, the central bank will not have access to personally identifiable information about end users\u2019 balances and transactions.\u201d\nCurrently, commercial banks in Israel pay 4.86% interest on customers\u2019 fiat shekel deposits and savings. Under the central bank\u2019s plans, banks would be able to hold the shekel CBDC as part of their short-term liquidity buffer, which would be non-interest bearing. \n\u201cThe data structure must enable the system to comply with all of the assumptions defined in Section 2.1, including the ability to enforce holding restrictions and to apply interest,\u201d researchers wrote, adding: \u201cIn particular, in a case where the interest is dependent on the type of user and the size of the balance, there is an advantage to having a centralized database.\u201d\nIsrael has been contemplating the issuance of a digital shekel since 2021, but no concrete pilot tests have been actioned as of the time of publication. \u201cGiven the interdependence between the various components of the digital shekel system, the decisions are not final,\u201d said the Bank of Israel. \nIn April 2023, Cointelegraph reported that the country\u2019s central bank could issue a shekel CBDC if stablecoin use increases. \u201cAt this point, there are no signs of substantial adoption of stablecoins as means of payment in Israel,\u201d the central bank said at the time.\nRelated: Local Web3 community launches \u2018Crypto Aid Israel\u2019 to help displaced citizens\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

      "article_detailed_content": "Independent (indie) musicians face many challenges on their way to recognition and financial stability, often stemming from the centralized nature of Web2 platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music and SoundCloud. While these platforms initially offered promising paths to exposure, the reality has fallen short, leaving artists struggling to secure fair compensation in terms of royalties and control over their work.\nThe issue lies in the way streaming services distribute revenue: a meager portion reaches the artists themselves, with record labels often negotiating significantly higher payouts than indie musicians for their work. Spotify\u2019s reported payout per stream further exemplifies this disparity, falling within a paltry range of $0.003 to $0.005 in 2024.\nAdding insult to injury, Spotify\u2019s recent policy change throws another obstacle in the path of indie artists. In 2024, the platform will cease royalties for tracks receiving fewer than 1,000 streams within a year. While technicalities suggest these tracks will still accrue royalties, the funds will be funneled upward, often benefiting bigger artists. This 1,000-stream cliff creates a significant barrier for indie musicians attempting to break through and build a fanbase.\nOne stat you won\u2019t find in your Spotify Wrapped is how much artists are paid for all that listening on the platform.\n\nThe max possible in 2023 is $0.003 per stream. And in 2024, Spotify will stop paying anything AT ALL for 2/3 of the tracks on the platform. pic.twitter.com/OCMHsHNce5\n\u2014 United Musicians and Allied Workers (@UMAW_) November 29, 2023\nAnother major challenge for indie artists is building a loyal fanbase. The current market is saturated with countless independent artists vying for attention. Building a personal brand and effectively utilizing social media platforms can help indie musicians connect with their audience and cultivate a fanbase, but it takes time, money and effort to make it big.\nHow NFTs can help musicians\nThis is where Web3, particularly nonfungible tokens (NFTs), emerges as a solution with the potential to transform the indie music industry. Music NFTs allow artists to sell songs, albums or exclusive digital content directly to their fans. The NFT approach bypasses intermediaries like record labels and streaming platforms, allowing artists to capture a larger share of the revenue generated by their work. Unlike streaming, where earnings are based on unpredictable play counts, NFTs offer the potential for more transparent and direct income streams.\nMusic NFTs also act as a bridge between artists and their fans, fostering a sense of community and ownership. By owning an NFT, fans actively support the artist and gain access to various benefits like early access to new songs or exclusive behind-the-scenes content.\nThe limitations of current music NFTs\nWhile music NFTs already exist on several blockchains, they can only represent one digital asset, such as a single song. This restriction is highly inflexible, as musicians typically work with multiple songs packaged as an album or playlist.\nThe current music NFTs are permanently static, lacking the capacity for updates or changes. Musicians desire the ability to evolve and modify their music and copyright terms over time, enhancing fan engagement by offering a continuous stream of fresh content.\nAlthough music NFTs hold great promise for fostering deeper connections with fan bases, this potential hinges on one critical factor \u2014 the ability to update the information embedded in the NFT itself.\nIntroducing dynamic Data NFTs\nItheum Protocol, an omni-chain data ownership infrastructure layer , aims to overcome these limitations by allowing musicians to develop and update their content through its Music Data NFT technology.\nAt the heart of the Itheum Protocol lies Data NFT technology, which allows musicians to transform static or dynamic data assets into NFTs. These NFTs function as transferable licenses, granting ownership and control over sharing or trading access rights to the data. Data NFTs empower creators to tokenize their data, similar to other NFT assets, but with the added flexibility of managing access rights.\nUnlike traditional NFTs that represent static assets, Music Data NFTs can be updated by artists, allowing for evolving content. This dynamic capability has the potential to enhance fan engagement, offering features like unlocking additional content upon interaction. Moreover, Music Data NFTs give artists greater control over distribution and royalty structures.\nVerified fans who own Data NFTs can also establish direct communication with artists, creating access opportunities for exclusive content such as unreleased music or merchandise. This connection could strengthen the bond between musicians and their fanbase.\nCointelegraph Accelerator participant Itheum envisions Music Data NFTs operating seamlessly across various blockchains. The envisioned interoperability enables artists to access diverse NFT ecosystems, potentially building fanbases and extending their exposure to a broader audience across various blockchain communities.\nKey features of Data NFTs. Source: Itheum Protocol\nGiving the power to musicians and fans\nMusicians can showcase their Music Data NFTs on NF.Tunes, a Web3 music portal built on Itheum Protocol\u2019s technology. The platform serves as a space for artists to exhibit their music Data NFTs, allowing fans to explore and listen to new music while engaging with artist communities.\nWith its Music Data NFTs, Itheum paves the way for a more artist-centric future in the music industry. By addressing the limitations of the current NFT models, Itheum offers a glimpse into a future where indie musicians not only navigate the labyrinthine world of music but thrive in it.\nAre you an indie musician who wants to use Music Data NFTs?

I think the institutions are trying as hard as they can not to let that happen,\u201d he said.\nAccording to his brother, Aaron, the big differentiator between this and previous bull runs is that spot ETFs have allowed Bitcoin to cross the chasm between early adopters and the early majority, referencing the lifecycle of technology adoption. \n\u201cWall Street is in for real this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a big differentiator.\u201d \nAt the same time, they said the bulk of retail investors have not entered the market yet, which seems to suggest that we are still in a relatively early stage of the bull market.\n\u201cRetail largely isn\u2019t here yet based on the social engagement, on Google Trends,\u201d Austin said. \nTo find out more about Altcoin Daily\u2019s outlook on the current bull market, check out the full interview on Cointelegraph\u2019s YouTube channel \u2014 and don\u2019t forget to subscribe!",

This latest move, made through its Strategic Innovation Lab, sets the stage for Ubisoft to contribute to the XPLA network beyond principal validation duties.\nAccording to a press release from XPLA, Ubisoft will \u201cactively participate in governance proposal decisions\u201d as part of the partnership. \nBlockchain\nXPLA is a Tendermint-based, layer-1, open-source blockchain developed to foster the transition from Web2 to Web3 gaming. Its mainnet was launched in August 2022 with the stated core goal of empowering players in a \u201cplay to own\u201d gaming paradigm.\nSome of the most popular intellectual properties with games on the XPLA blockchain include The Walking Dead: All-Stars and Summoners War: Chronicles.\nPer a blog post from XPLA, its latest partnership is a growth marker for the network:\n\u201cThe addition of Ubisoft, a global gaming company, to the XPLA family is just the beginning! We eagerly anticipate more validators joining our ecosystem, enhancing the security and stability of our network.\u201d\nGaming\nUbisoft, based in Rennes, France, is among the world\u2019s largest gaming companies. Its games have won myriad awards and sold a combined total of somewhere around 800 million titles. With a market capitalization of $2.75 billion as of the time of publication, it\u2019s the second largest in Europe, behind only Poland\u2019s CD Projekt Red ($2.99 billion).\nThe company was among the earliest gaming firms to invest in Web3 and blockchain technology. Back in 2021, it published a manifesto laying out its plans in the blockchain and Web3 spaces with heavy emphasis on player agency and ownership.\nAs Cointelegraph reported in October 2021, Ubisoft is also a major investor in Animoca Brands, a Hong Kong-based blockchain games developer. \nBlockchain gaming continues to rise in popularity as the Web3 space begins to fill out. While it still hasn\u2019t reached its early promises of decentralizing gaming assets at scale and revolutionizing the role of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in the public perception, the steady entrance of major gaming outfits such as Ubisoft and Square-Enix bodes well for the sector.\nRelated: Square Enix will modify organizational structure to support blockchain, Web3, AI in 2024\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Nifty Newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest NFT headlines.

      "article_detailed_content": "Major stablecoin operator Tether continues to expand its USDT stablecoin across various blockchain networks, entering a strategic collaboration with the Celo network.\nTether (USDT) on Celo, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible layer-1 network designed for fast and low-cost payments.\nAnnouncing the news to Cointelegraph on March 11, Tether noted that the new integration brings a range of benefits to USDT, including \u201cnotably low, sub-cent transaction fees\u201d hovering around $0.001, enabling feasible microtransactions.\n\u201cOne of Celo\u2019s core features since launching in April 2020 was its design for fast, low-cost payments worldwide,\u201d a source close to Celo told Cointelegraph. \u201cIndirectly, as an L2, there is a value sharing happening with Ethereum that\u2019s not happening today as an L1,\u201d a spokesperson said, adding:\n\u201cIn transitioning to an Ethereum L2, gas fees would stay low, critical to achieving global prosperity and core to the Celo community mission.\u201d\nUSDT will join an array of stable assets available on the Celo platform, including Mento\u2019s eXOF, which tracks the CFA franc, and the cREAL, which tracks the Brazilian real. The use cases for stable assets on Celo include remittances, savings, lending and cross-border payments.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Tether USDT to the Celo ecosystem, which is fast becoming a leader in stablecoins and real-world assets,\u201d Celo co-founder and foundation president Rene Reinsberg said.\n\u201cWith Tether USDT soon available on Celo, users have even more options for fast, low-cost payments and access to robust stablecoin use cases that benefit everyday users around the world,\u201d Reinsberg noted.\nA Tether representative declined to say when the first batch of USDT will be issued and go live on the Celo blockchain.\nRelated: Tether launches recovery tool to migrate USDT between blockchains\nUSDT\u2019s major rival, the Circle-issued USD Coin (USDC), announced a native launch on the Celo blockchain in January 2024 as well. Circle said the first USDC became available on Celo on Feb. 22.\nCelo-based USDT will join 14 blockchains currently supported by Tether, including Tron, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and Omni. Tron and Ethereum are the two largest blockchains for USDT at the time of writing, accounting for 50% and 45% of all issued USDT, respectively, according to Tether Transparency.\nThe news comes amid the crypto community increasingly complaining about high fees on the Ethereum network as Ether (ETH) prices pass $4,000. Skyrocketing ETH fees have also impacted Ethereum-based USDT, as ERC-20 Tether USDT requires ETH gas fees to complete transactions.\nDespite Celo being an EVM-compatible network, there is no dependency on Ethereum in terms of network fees, according to a source close to Celo. \u201cFor example, if Ethereum fees go up, it doesn\u2019t mean L2 fees, given certain architectural choices, go up in the same way or at all even,\u201d the person noted.\nMagazine: The DeFi bots pumping Solana\u2019s stablecoin volume",

      "article_detailed_content": "Imagine a future where organizations operate not under individuals\u2019 control but by a community\u2019s collective will. Decisions are made collaboratively in an environment where the power is distributed among members, not concentrated in a central authority. This concept, once confined to the realm of science fiction, is now taking shape in the form of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\nDAOs are internet-based organizations fueled by blockchain technology. They function through smart contracts, self-executing code that automates decision-making based on established rules. Ownership and voting rights are often linked to crypto tokens, empowering members to actively shape the DAO\u2019s trajectory. This structure upholds transparency as all transactions and decisions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, accessible for public scrutiny.\nThe challenges around DAOs\nBut as with any disruptive innovation, DAOs come with their own set of challenges, raising a critical question: can they truly revolutionize governance, or are they destined to remain a captivating experiment?\nOne of the most significant challenges facing DAOs is the potential for large tokenholders, known as whales, to influence voting outcomes in their favor. Due to their extensive holdings, whales can manipulate governance outcomes, undermining the collective decision-making process and jeopardizing the fairness and legitimacy of the DAO. According to a research paper, voting power in DAO governance systems is unfair and highly centralized, with fewer than 10 addresses having full control over most DAOs. The study shows that for crypto platforms Compound, Fei and Uniswap, the community delegate vote share is low at about 10% or less.\nThe centralization issue in the voting process is further exacerbated by Sybil attacks, where individuals impersonate multiple voters to skew outcomes using the ease of creating multiple accounts. These attacks can erode trust and hinder the legitimacy of a DAO\u2019s governance.\nWhile some participants in DAOs may be aligned with collective interests and long-term goals, investors will inevitably be driven solely by quick profits, disregarding a project\u2019s sustainability and future. The intrinsic importance of tradeable governance tokens in DAO operations makes aligning financial incentives and community interests challenging, particularly in optimizing a project\u2019s growth potential over time.\nRecognition of diverse contributions\nSecure identity verification measures and a transparent governance system can solve the problems within DAOs. AirDAO, a community-governed layer-1 blockchain, recognizes the solution and aims to make decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible, fair and user-friendly for everyone.\nBuilt on its own blockchain network -AMB-NET- AirDAO offers a product suite to simplify complex financial operations. The suite includes cross-chain bridging to Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain along with a staking platform, a multichain network explorer and FirepotSwap \u2014 a native decentralized exchange (DEX) developed in partnership with Firepot Finance.\nUnderstanding the challenges of governance manipulation and multiple account creation, AirDAO implemented solutions to foster a fairer and more inclusive decision-making process:\nFacial verification: Through a partnership with Fractal ID, a provider of Web3 identity solutions, AirDAO links wallets to users using facial verification technology. The integration enables the creation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that verify identities without requiring the disclosure of personal information or compromising user anonymity. Facial verification reduces the ability to create multiple accounts, ensures each vote is from a unique participant and promotes transparency and accountability.\nThe issuance of the AirDAO\u2019s governance soulbound token (SBT), AMB, is also based on the user\u2019s facial recognition biometric data verified by Fractal ID.\nImpact-based governance: AirDAO\u2019s system rewards users with soulbound tokens (SBTs) based on their contributions to the platform, such as providing liquidity or participating in governance discussions. SBTs determine an individual\u2019s voting power, giving a stronger voice to those who actively contribute to the project\u2019s success.\nAirDAO rewards the community for contributing to its ecosystem with impact-based SBTs. Source: AirDAO\nAirDAO recognizes that its success relies on the contributions of a diverse community. Whether users validate transactions, contribute their skills or champion AirDAO as a Governor or Ambassador, their efforts will be crowned with governance SBTs that reflect users\u2019 benefits to the ecosystem.\nA vision for decentralization\nAirDAO\u2019s Governance Working Group (GWG), comprised of around 30 community members with expertise in various fields, underlines the platform\u2019s commitment to community governance.\nAirDAO\u2019s vision is to complete decentralization and become a fully community-governed project that fosters collective decision-making within the DeFi space. If successful, AirDAO\u2019s potential to address key challenges in DAO governance could pave the way for a more equitable and trustworthy future for DAOs and the wider DeFi ecosystem.\nLearn more about AirDAO Governance Platform\nJoin support Telegram group for AirDAO governors\nDisclaimer.

It surged 430% five months later, from $11,500 to $61,300 by mid-March 2021.\nIn doing so, it smashed the previous all-time high of $19,665 on Dec. 16, 2017.\nBitcoin\u2019s change in price between May 11, 2020 and March 15, 2021.

Source: Ethereum Research\nThis validation code leverages ERC-4337 account abstraction \u2014 the underlying technology of smart contract wallets \u2014 to prevent private keys from being displayed while signing transactions in the future, rendering these accounts immune from a quantum attack.\nRelated: Ethereum leans into rollup-centric future as Dencun hard fork looms\nAccording to Buterin, users who have never approved a transaction from an Ethereum wallet are \u201calready safe\u201d from any potential quantum-related exploit, as only the wallet address has ever been made publicly available.\nHe also added that the infrastructure needed to implement such as hard fork \u201ccould in principle start to be built tomorrow.\u201d\nThe advent of quantum computing has been a long-feared inflection point for the crypto industry, as a computer capable of breaking blockchain encryption could see once-untouchable user funds stolen in large volumes and at rapid rates.\nHowever, most computer scientists and developers believe that quantum computing is still a ways off, with Google and IBM engineers estimating that quantum computing won\u2019t be sufficiently developed until 2029 at the earliest.\nMagazine: Google to fix diversity-borked Gemini AI, ChatGPT goes insane: AI Eye",

However, Luz said that some are trading on WhatsApp and Telegram groups.\nAccording to the chief marketing officer of Flincap, Oladotun Wilfred Akangbe, the continuing uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulation in Nigeria and the decision to halt Binance operations can undermine the confidence of many people in the space. He added that it could lead to massive fear, uncertainty and doubt in Nigeria\u2019s crypto space.\nIn an official statement on its website, Binance said it would automatically convert naira balances to Tether (USDT) from March 8 at 8:00 am UTC and cease support for naira deposits from March 5 at 2:00 pm.\nWithdrawals have not been allowed since March 8 at 6:00 am, and the conversion rate is 1 USDT for 1,515.13 naira. Binance\u2019s peer-to-peer platform delisted all naira trading pairs in late February.\nRelated: Binance temporarily suspends Solana network withdrawals, citing \u2018increased volume\u2019\nOn Feb. 27, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria argued that crypto exchanges in Nigeria were suspected of handling illicit transactions, pointing to \u201csuspicious flows\u201d of funds at Binance.\nAs the suspicions of Binance\u2019s alleged illicit operations in Nigeria intensified, the Nigerian House of Representatives Committee on Financial Crimes called Binance CEO Richard Teng to appear before the committee before March 4.\nIn 2023, Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission stated that Binance Nigeria wasn\u2019t registered or regulated by it, making its operations in Nigeria illegal. In December 2023, the Central Bank of Nigeria reversed its stance on crypto assets, advising banks to ignore the previous ban on crypto transactions.\nMagazine: The DeFi bots pumping Solana\u2019s stablecoin volume",

      "article_detailed_content": "MakerDAO, the organization responsible for the development of the Maker (MKR) token, has approved an \u201cExecutive Vote\u201d to introduce temporary fee adjustments to strengthen the protocol due to heightened market volatility and bullish sentiment resulting in a reduction in reserves for its Dai (DAI) stablecoin.\nThe suggestion comes in response to a rapid decrease in the Dai supply from $5 billion to $4.4 billion in the last seven days, as outlined in the proposal from BA Labs, a member of Maker\u2019s Stability Advisory Council.\nScreenshot of MakerDAO executive vote announcement on X. Source: MakerDAO\nIn the proposal, MakerDAO intends to expedite the approval process for a stablecoin stability measure if users choose to redeem a portion of the $1.1 billion in real-world assets (RWA) available on the protocol. Despite Dai being overcollateralized, using RWA vehicles as collateral poses potential liquidity issues if Dai\u2019s selling continues.\n The proposal reads:\n\u201cLiquid stablecoin reserves and reserves deployed to RWAs are more than sufficient to sustain the increasing pressure generated by the potential bullish market sentiment. The issue lies in the liquidity crunch inherent in the exposure toward stablecoins deployed through RWAs.\u201d \nAlthough Maker DAO\u2019s ecosystem is currently stable, it deems it necessary to anticipate potentially unpredictable user actions. The proposed measures include changes to Maker Vaults, the SparkLend DAI Borrow Rate, the Peg Stability Module (PSM), the Dai Savings Rate and the Governance Security Module (GSM) Pause Delay.\nRelated: Wyoming passes law granting DAOs legal status\nThe adjustments include raising the stability fees on different collateral assets registered on the platform from 15% to 17.25%. In addition, it plans to increase the SparkLend DAI Borrow annual percentage yield from the current 6.7% to 16%. The slate of changes was approved to go into effect from March 10 at 7:55 pm UTC.\nMakerDAO also plans to adjust the PSM to provide a cooldown for debt ceiling increases to drop from 24 to 12 hours. Other measures that will be implemented include incrementing the Dai Savings Rate to 15% and the GSM Pause Delay from 48 hours to 16 hours for swifter implementation of future adjustments.\nWhile these adjustments are temporary, there is no automatic process for reverting the fees. GFX Labs, a blockchain research and development company, expressed on the proposal\u2019s discussion page that the changes were in the right direction but raised concerns about their magnitude, fearing potential market dislocations and disruptions.\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable?

      "article_detailed_content": "Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon has signed a bill into law establishing a legal framework for the formation and management of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). \nThe bill was sponsored by the legislature\u2019s Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology and introduces a legal status for decentralized unincorporated nonprofit associations (DUNAs) based in the state.\nThis is huge news for DAOs.\n\nRegistering as a DUNA legal entity will enable DAOs to engage in legal contracts with other entities and provide legal protection to individual DAO members. Other legal entities available to DAOs fall short on these metrics.\n\nLearn more from\u2026 https://t.co/j16Zr3xkw1\n\u2014 Ross Shuel | shuel.eth (@0xShuel) March 8, 2024\nThe document enacted on March 7 outlines the requirements for forming a DUNA, covers the roles of smart contracts and offers provisions over the legal responsibilities of the association and its members. According to the new law, a DUNA is a separate legal entity from its members, meaning that the DAO can be held liable without implicating its individual members. \n\u201cA person is not liable for a breach of a decentralized unincorporated nonprofit association\u2019s contract merely because the person is a member, administrator, authorized to participate in the management of the affairs of the nonprofit association or considered as a member by the nonprofit association.\u201d\nA DAO is an entity with no central leadership. The decision-making process is bottom-up, with a community governed by a set of rules enforced by a blockchain. Giving a DAO legal existence enables a decentralized entity to establish contracts with third parties, open bank accounts, pay taxes and meet informational reporting requirements.\nNonprofit status\nIn an analysis on March 8, venture capital firm a16z crypto asserted that there is a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding of the nonprofit designation provided by the new law.\nAccording to Miles Jennings, a16z\u2019s general counsel, and David Kerr, principal at Cowrie law firm, a Wyoming-based DAO is not prohibited from engaging in for-profit activities.\n\u201cUnder Wyoming law, both the UNA and the DUNA are able to engage in for-profit activities. This would include the operation of a decentralized exchange protocol, a decentralized social media protocol, you name it.\u201d\nDAOs are also allowed to pay compensation to their members, including in exchange for participation in the governance process, reads the analysis. \u201cWyoming\u2019s approach supports the web3 ethos, while still enabling cash flows to digital asset holders. This is a significant breakthrough.\u201d\nMagazine: Are DAOs overhyped and unworkable? Lessons from the front lines",

      "article_detailed_content": "Web3\u2019s growth presents challenges for newcomers who find navigating various subsectors and DApps confusing. A unified platform would simplify the onboarding process, enhancing clarity and promoting faster adoption of Web3 use cases.\nWeb3, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, and digital currencies, is rapidly evolving. However, its fragmented nature mirrors the chaos of the early internet before the dot-com bubble. The lack of interoperability between decentralized networks and poor communication across different Web3 sectors contribute to this disarray.\nToday\u2019s Web3 lacks a unifying ecosystem, causing the market to fracture into multiple, independently evolving use cases. Crypto enthusiasts have to use various decentralized applications (DApps) and platforms to perform multiple transactions and interact with the different sectors of Web3. However, this isn\u2019t a sustainable growth model for the Web3 industry and is more of a deterrent rather than a benefit when it comes to crypto adoption.\nA one-stop shop platform could be a good start for beginners who can try various Web3 use cases from a single starting point. Such a unified experience would provide clarity and a smooth gateway to the Web3 world, acting as a Google-like aggregator for these diverse sectors.\nThe rise of super apps in Web3\nRecognizing the need for a more integrated approach, some Web3 players are moving beyond the hype. Legion Network is emerging as a notable example among these. As a one-stop shop for Web3, Legion Network addresses the complexity of the industry and reaches new audiences. It brings together essential Web3 use cases, including a proprietary crypto wallet with comprehensive portfolio tracking, DeFi swaps and bridges, engaging play-to-earn/win games, captivating quests with prize rewards, a launchpad for emerging projects and a unique SocialFi experience that fosters community engagement.\nUsers can download Legion's super app, which is available on the App Store and the Google Play Store. The app has grown significantly since its launch, with over 5 million downloads, an average rating of 4.2 stars from 215,000 reviews, and nearly 500 million game plays. These metrics underscore the app\u2019s popularity and effectiveness in engaging and retaining a diverse user base.\nHere\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the key features that distinguish Legion Network in the Web3 landscape:\nCrypto wallet and asset management: Legion Network offers a fully noncustodial wallet supporting over 15,000 tokens across over 40 blockchains. It allows seamless integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for swapping and bridging and provides features for crypto portfolio tracking and display for nonfungible tokens (NFTs), focusing on user security and ease of use.\nStaking program and Bolts system: Legion Network\u2019s innovative staking program exemplifies their commitment to a sustainable ecosystem. It rewards users with increased access to services based on their staking level, promoting a more active and engaged community.\nMoreover, Legion Network has effectively gamified every aspect of its app. Through Bolts, users earn rewards for their interactions, allowing them to unlock perks across all services. This approach ensures equitable access to the app\u2019s features, regardless of users\u2019 ability to make in-app purchases.\nPlay-to-earn/win games and quests: Gaming and quests are integral to the Legion experience, aligning with the play-to-earn and play-to-win models. Users can complete tasks and quests to win prizes and rewards, sometimes in collaboration with partners.\nThis gamification extends throughout the app with the SocialFi aspect and a raffle system where users can use Bolts earned from platform engagement to enter and win prizes, underscoring the Legion Network ecosystem\u2019s emphasis on gamification.\nLaunchpad for emerging projects: Legion Network\u2019s launchpad introduces users to new blockchain projects, fostering innovation within the Web3 space.\nLearning hub: Integral to Legion\u2019s super app is Empower Academy, a comprehensive learning experience centered around blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and various aspects of the Legion Network ecosystem. The educational platform offers CPD-certified courses and a unique earn-while-you-learn system.\nPersonalized user experience and community building: Legion enhances user engagement by allowing customization of profiles and showcasing NFT collections, staking ranks and wallet stats.

The platform caters to creators and businesses, providing a user-friendly infrastructure to build custom metaverse spaces while seamlessly facilitating NFT trading all within a single platform.\nIs a super app the future of Web3?\nThanks to a combination of all major blockchain and Web3 elements, including DeFi, NFTs, gaming, cryptocurrencies, social and the metaverse, Legion Network aims to create an easy access point for everyone new to crypto space and transit users from a Web2 to a Web3 mindset.\nLearn more about Legion Network\nDisclaimer.

      "article_detailed_content": "The Arbitrum DAO is voting to fund the legal defense costs of Tornado Cash\u2019s developers. If approved, the community would donate up to 600,000 ARB tokens in the first year, worth nearly $1.3 million at the time of writing. \nA proposal submitted on March 7 by pseudonymous delegate DK seeks to fund a \u201crobust legal defense\u201d for Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, the developers behind the crypto mixer Tornado Cash. In addition, the funds could be used for public relations and advocacy efforts promoting awareness around privacy-preserving technologies and legal burdens for developers.\n\u201cBy rallying support for their legal fund, we aim to safeguard not only the future of privacy-preserving technologies but also the broader principles of innovation, decentralization, and individual sovereignty within our industry.\u201d\nThe proposal sets three tiers for voting under different funding levels, ranging from 200,000 to 600,000 ARB. To date, more than 80% of the votes have been cast for the highest tier. The deadline for voting is March 14.\nThe accusations against Tornado Cash and its founders revolve around the platform\u2019s alleged role in laundering over $1 billion in illicit funds, including money linked to the North Korean hacking organization Lazarus Group. As a result, Tornado Cash has been subject to significant legal actions, including its addition to the United States sanctions lists, effectively banning residents in the country from using the service and sparking controversy within the cryptocurrency community.\nProposal open for vote\nSupporters of Tornado Cash argue that the platform merely provides software for decentralized money transmission and does not directly engage in money transmission itself, which challenges the basis of the charges against its developers. According to the crypto advocacy group Coin Center, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidelines state that an anonymizing software provider should not be considered a money transmitter.\nStorm and Pertsev face several charges from U.S. authorities, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business.\nThe first two charges can each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the charge for operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business is punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\u201cThese [legal] challenges not only threaten the developers\u2019 ability to continue their work but also undermine the fundamental principles of decentralization and individual freedom upon which projects with privacy-preserving technologies are built.\u201d\nThe community proposal comes just a few days after the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe canceled a fundraiser dedicated to collecting legal fees for Storm and Pertsev, citing a breach of their terms of service that could \u201cexpose GoFundMe, its employees or Users to any harm or liability of any type.\u201d\nMagazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 \u2014 The race to build safe and legal coin mixers\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest news in crypto legislation and regulations.

He said:\n\u201cThe real utility of [scaling solutions] is if developers can quickly work with this infrastructure to actually create useful scale apps that go mainstream, for example, right again right now.\u201d\nAverage monthly active developers decreased 24% to 22,411 in 2023, compared to 2022, according to a Jan. 17 report by Electric Capital. The firm attributes this drop to a record number of new developers who joined in 2022. The report notes:\n\u201cWhile developers overall are down 24%, the most valuable segment of developers (2+ year tenure who contribute the most code) continues to steadily grow.\u201d\nWhen asked about the future of blockchain scalability, Arjun said that he expects to see hundreds of application-specific rollups that will be united under a user experience-friendly app layer, much like today\u2019s Web2 shopping experiences that simplify online purchases.\n\u201cWhen you click on the buy button on [Amazon], it opens up a payment page, but the user doesn\u2019t know all the complexity behind the process,\u201d said Arjun, adding that Web3 infrastructure will need to simplify the user experience in a similar way to attract more mainstream users.\nArjun is also the co-founder of Web3 data availability and consensus layer, Avail, which closed a $27 million seed funding round on Feb. 26, led by Founders Fund and Dragonfly.\nThe funds will be deployed to help accelerate the unification of Web3 by bolstering the developments of the firm\u2019s three core products, also known as the \u201cAvail Trinity:\u201d the data availability layer, the nexus unification layer and the fusion security layer.\nRelated: Ethena becomes highest earning DApp in crypto\nExchange or buy MATIC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

      "article_detailed_content": "The long-awaited Bitcoin (BTC) price all-time high finally happened on March 5 after the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency rallied above $69,000. \nAnd there we have it. We are officially in a bull market.\nDuring the last bull market, developers, projects and artists all shared their lofty goals and ideas of how crypto and blockchain would revolutionize the entire world. While some of that happened, in reality, a lot was left unachieved.\nSo, now that market conditions have finally improved, everyone has another chance at delivering on what was promised. The Agenda co-hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond\u2019s assumption is that with better market conditions and profitable balance sheets, blockchain projects should have sufficient runway to build the products and services that hope to solve a lot of the world\u2019s problems.\nOn episode 31 of The Agenda, Salmond and DeYoung share their views on the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s price hitting a new all-time high and what this could mean for crypto in 2024.\nBitcoin\u2019s phoenix moment is a sign of a maturing asset and market\nOnce one gets past the excitement and fixation surrounding Bitcoin hitting new all-time price highs, a more contemplative mood sets in, wherein the significance of the milestone is considered.\nWhen asked about what BTC price going to the moon means in the larger scheme of things, Salmond suggested that it is \u201ca sign of maturity,\u201d especially considering that:\n\u201cThe ETFs are kind of like buyers of infinite demand, right? They\u2019re like purchasers of infinite demand. Every day for the last two or three weeks, they\u2019ve been buying $500 million minimum of Bitcoin daily, or $450 million daily. Even today, as Bitcoin price sold off after hitting a new all-time high, ETFs like IBIT from BlackRock traded like 1 billion shares.\u201d\nDeYoung expressed his perspective that, unlike previous bull markets, social chatter from non-crypto bros pales in comparison to what was seen in 2017 and 2020 and that he found himself somewhat surprised not to be looking at his portfolio value every five minutes:\n\u201cI\u2019m here for something deeper. So yeah, now that the price is back, I feel like I\u2019m a bit detached from that. And I also think that we\u2019re just \u2014 I mean, you can correct me if you disagree \u2014 but I feel like we\u2019re just still so early into this bull run that I feel like getting super hyped up about hitting $69,000 is a bit premature, I guess.\u201d\n2024 will be more about results than ideas\nSalmond and DeYoung agreed that in 2024, blockchain and crypto\u2019s success is more likely to be defined by builders\u2019 ability to deliver useful products and services instead of the value of their tokens. DeYoung said:\n\u201cI hope that it means that some of the people that are riding the wave up will then take some of their money and throw it into the more passion projects. Like they made their money with the [...] hype plays, maybe the bigger projects that make a little cash. Now they\u2019ve got an extra few ETH lying around, and they can throw it into their friend\u2019s passion project and help that get off the ground, or the kind of cool, unique use cases.\u201d\nDeYoung suggested that the synergy between crypto and artificial intelligence will continue to strengthen as the need to verify data and media becomes more necessary. According to DeYoung, blockchains seem perfectly purposed for cataloging and authenticating data, and he expects that they will play a critical role in media and possibly in government in the coming years.\nRelated: Bitcoin accumulation phase ends as ETFs fuel new $100K BTC price target\nSalmond, on the other hand, is hopeful that music nonfungible tokens (NFTs) will become a trendy industry again in 2024:\n\u201cYou know, the market blew up two years ago. So, I thought the phoenix of NFTs would be music NFTs. I really thought that that was the one kind of subsector of the industry that made the most sense and would have the most growth \u2014 it would just be easy to kind of bridge between Web3, blockchain and the traditional music industry. And there were so many platforms and people that were fundraising to the tune of tens of millions of dollars for music NFTs that I\u2019m surprised nothing has happened.\u201d\nSalmond conceded that perhaps the timing of his high expectations lack patience, something that he explained is critical in the fintech space:\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned investing in Ethereum, Bitcoin maybe, but really Ethereum and some of the other, Ethereum-like coins \u2014 one thing I\u2019ve learned about tech companies is you don\u2019t expect results at the end of one year, or even at the end of two years, or even at the end of three years. You expect the payoff and the result at the end of five or 10 years. Like ETH is clearly a five-to-10-year investment.\u201d\nTo hear more from Jonathan and Ray\u2019s conversation on The Agenda \u2014 including juicy details about upcoming episode guests \u2014 listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

While the foundation is offloading a large number of tokens, it mentioned in the announcement that the sale included a vesting period of two years, prohibiting the buyer from selling the tokens before then.\nWithin the vesting period, the Optimism Foundation highlighted that the buyer can still use the tokens for governance participation. The foundation wrote:\n\u201cDuring the lock-up, the purchaser will be able to delegate the tokens to unaffiliated third parties for participation in governance.\u201d\nThe organization also explained that the tokens were from an \u201cunallocated portion of the OP token treasury.\u201d The foundation said these assets are part of the organization\u2019s original working budget, which is 30% of the initial OP token supply.\nThe foundation informed the community that the OP tokens will be sent in several transactions in the coming days. Optimism assured the community that these were planned transactions, suggesting they were the tokens sold in the private sale.\nRelated: $900M in vested tokens set to be released in February\nOptimism did not disclose the details of the sale or the buyer, as the transaction was private. This sparked some discussions on X, with some viewing the sale negatively while others defended the foundation.\nEthereum advocate Anthony Sassano said that while he loves Optimism and has invested in it, private sales without transparency leave \u201ca bad taste\u201d in his mouth. Meanwhile, other community members argued that the team behind Optimism has to earn a living, too.\nCommunity members discussing the Optimism private sale.

On Sept. 21, 2023, the network transferred 116 million OP tokens, worth about $160 million at the time, after a private sale it conducted.\nAt the time, some observers feared the sale would affect prices negatively. However, the tokens were also subjected to a two-year lockup, meaning they did not immediately impact the token\u2019s price.\nMagazine: Zhu Su pumps Milady to $19K, Alchemy Pay crypto bank, HK tokens: Asia Express",

      "article_detailed_content": "Mobile device users in emerging economies and those hampered by outdated hardware could tap into a new virtual smartphone application running on Solana\u2019s blockchain and decentralized cloud infrastructure.\nAphone debuted in the Solana ecosystem on March 7 as a web-based virtual smartphone that gives users access to various Web3 and conventional applications. APhone ecosystem development and growth lead Jennifer Booze unpacked details of the service in correspondence with Cointelegraph following its launch.\nCointelegraph tested Aphone\u2019s virtual device, which features several Web3 DApps and conventional mobile applications. Source: Aphone\nAphone looks and feels like an Android smartphone and is platform-agnostic, meaning it can operate on a browser, Android or Apple device. Booze says it functions more like an operating system with its interface, features and underlying technology rather than replacing a device\u2019s operating system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cloud smartphone environment that users can access through their current devices, leveraging decentralized cloud computing to run Web3 applications smoothly without needing local hardware upgrades,\u201d Booze explains.\nThe team envisions the virtual device as a means of onboarding users to Web3 applications and protocols previously hindered by the hardware limitations of devices.\nRelated: Solana Saga fetches up to $5K on eBay as Bonk frenzy causes sell-out\nAphone\u2019s service bypasses the hardware limits of older smartphone models by operating on a decentralized cloud-based graphics processing unit (GPU) computing infrastructure, Aethir. Aphone\u2019s interface and its applications run on the cloud service, which allows users to access apps and games that the physical device would not be able to handle.\nBooze said the virtual device\u2019s primary use case is to drive access to the broader Web3 ecosystem as smartphones become increasingly ubiquitous in emerging markets alongside the proliferation of mobile internet access.\n\u201cBy leveraging Aethir\u2019s decentralized cloud technology, APhone enables these users to experience advanced Web3 applications, NFTs, DeFi platforms, blockchain games and run multiple smartphones on a single device.\u201d\nThe virtual alternative to buying a new smartphone will cost users $20 a year. Prospective users can buy an Aphone nonfungible token (NFT), which is minted and burned on the Solana blockchain, giving users access to the virtual device.\nThe device will also provide access to several decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) operating on Solana. This includes Helium, which rewards users for providing network coverage and validating transactions.\nRelated: \u2018107,000 GPUs on the waitlist\u2019 \u2014 Io.net beta launch attracts data centers, GPU clusters\nCointelegraph asked why Aphone needs to operate on blockchain infrastructure and the purpose of its native PHONE token. Booze said that operating on Solana offers high transaction speeds, lower costs and enhanced security and decentralization.\n\u201cThese features support a seamless Web3 experience, including managing NFTs, tokens, and accessing DApps. Aethir\u2019s infrastructure enables the powerful processing capabilities required for demanding Web3 applications, making the integration of blockchain technology essential for APhone\u2019s operation,\u201d Booze adds.\nThe device\u2019s native token is set to be used for governance and rewards incentivization mechanisms to drive user engagement and participation.\nAs Cointelegraph previously explored, DePINs are making their mark as resources to power artificial intelligence tools, which are becoming increasingly valuable.

      "article_detailed_content": "Researchers in the United Kingdom have studied the viability of current intellectual property (IP) laws and their application to new technologies like the metaverse. In the study, the researchers identified the shortcomings of existing laws and presented their recommendations. \nOn March 7, the U.K. government published an externally commissioned research report titled \u201cIP and Metaverse.\u201d The report dove into the existing literature on IP laws and how they can apply to the metaverse. Within the study, the researchers concluded that there are metaverse-specific IP issues, such as IP governance in an interoperable environment and regulating technologies like the blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) within virtual worlds.\nAccording to the report, many legal challenges come with interoperability, including the unauthorized dissemination of copyrighted work. The researchers highlighted that the lack of interoperability has been important in preventing people from illegally distributing copyrighted material. With interoperability being a key feature in a metaverse, the researchers believe this could pose a challenge in governing the use and circulation of copyrighted work.\nMeanwhile, blockchain\u2019s inherent characteristics, such as immutability or being \u201ctamper-proof,\u201d also pose a challenge to enforcing IP laws. The researchers wrote:\n\u201cBlockchain\u2019s inherent resistance to change or correction undermines the ability to flexibly manage or update IP rights. This is an issue which becomes especially worrisome in the context of ownership disputes, as well as for navigating the termination of agreements and rights if licensors or rightholders seek to leave the Metaverse.\u201d\nHowever, AI use in the potential metaverse governance of IP also poses some anticipated challenges. The researchers argued that algorithmic management of infringements is \u201cextremely vulnerable to misuse\u201d because of the absence of human oversight to guarantee the legitimacy of enforcement.\nRelated: Majority of social media posts about metaverse show positive sentiment\nApart from this, AI-generated content also brings up another challenge for IP enforcement in the metaverse. According to the study, reliance on AI tools has the potential to invalidate claims of inventorship in content. The research highlighted examples and cases that showed that \u201conly works partially assisted by AI\u201d are able to be protected by IP laws.\nBecause of the anticipated issues in IP governance within the metaverse, the researchers concluded that there\u2019s a need for clarity on a \u201cplethora of key issues.\u201d This includes legal issues on copyrights, trademarks, patents, designs, user-generated content, virtual property and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) within the metaverse. Because of this, the researchers believed that it\u2019s necessary to formulate IP approaches for addressing governance and enforcement issues for a metaverse.\nMagazine: Doctor Who materializes in Web3: Tony Pearce\u2019s journey in time and space\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest news in crypto legislation and regulations.

      "article_detailed_content": "While technologists continue to explore artificial intelligence (AI) use cases in all business verticals, a Coinbase research report suggests that AI-related tokens may be over-hyped right now, at least in the short and medium term. \nThe rising popularity of generative AI spurred niche crypto sub-ecosystems over the last couple of years. However, Coinbase research analyst David Han believes that the rapid changes in AI \u201cmake us cautious\u201d of the long-term sustainability of most AI tokens.\nOne of the primary challenges with crypto AI projects lies within the core of both technologies. While crypto projects often aim for decentralization, the current AI offering relies heavily on centralized components and data sources, argues Han.\nIn addition, most projects in the niche have failed to attract investors \u2014 resulting in under-indexed capital allocation.\nThe report highlights two opportunities for the crypto AI ecosystem \u2014 improving the blockchain data for creating human-readable transactions and analysis and helping decentralize the predominantly centralized AI infrastructure. However, Han said:\n\u201cA decentralized AI future, as it is currently envisioned by many in the crypto industry, is not guaranteed \u2014 in fact, the future of the AI industry itself is still largely undetermined.\u201d\nDespite the negative outlook, many AI tokens haverecently outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and major stocks such as Nvidia and Microsoft. Coinbase attributed this to the market sentiment built by the broader crypto market and supported by related AI news headlines.\nAI tokens have a wide distribution of returns on days where BTC traded negatively. Source: coinbase.bynder.com\nThe crypto AI narrative could grow even stronger amid the continued constructive crypto market and the outperforming AI sector. However, Coinbase suggests that driving \u201cmeaningful adoption\u201d will require more than just decentralizing AI components.\nIt is important to note that the AI ecosystem is currently in its nascency and will have to \u201cunderstand the underlying trading narrative\u201d at the very least, eventually providing a comparable alternative to today\u2019s crypto assets.\nRelated: Coinbase shares climb after-hours as exchange fixes site jitters\nComplimenting Coinbase\u2019s suggestion for meaningful developments in the crypto AI sphere, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently said AI could becrucial to eradicating bugs buried deep within its code.\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shares optimism about using AI to fix blockchain bugs.

Phaver introduces a Web3 social app with a gamified system to combat botting and incentivize genuine user engagement.\nSocial media has a fake account problem, and a 2018 survey highlighted a growing concern among parents of teens \u2014 with over 65% alarmed by fake accounts and bots on social media.\nThe discovery of 1,305 bot accounts on X (formerly Twitter) that spread political disinformation during a critical Republican debate and a Donald Trump interview have underscored the extent of the problem and its potential to disrupt the fabric of democratic discourse.\nIndiana University also conducted research that uncovered a bot network of 1,140 ChatGPT-powered X accounts that stole images to create fake profiles and engaged with each other through replies and tweets using advanced artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe battle against bots and fake accounts in social media\nFor traditional social networks, addressing this crisis of user authenticity is a daunting task. Over 47% of 2022\u2019s web traffic was bot-generated, with 30% being harmful bots. Emerging as a potential solution with blockchain, Web3 offers mechanisms to ensure the authenticity of every participant on a specific platform.\nPhaver, a Web3 social app, introduces a gamified solution to fight against bot accounts and incentivize users to build a reputation on social media. By implementing a level system similar to loyalty tiers in airline programs, Phaver aims to discourage detrimental practices plaguing the current social media landscape, such as farming and multi-accounting.\nPhaver aims to build a more meritocratic and user-owned internet. Source: Phaver\nUsers accumulate a credibility score akin to status miles, which determines their level within the app. Phaver\u2019s system penalizes harmful behaviors and rewards genuine engagement and credibility building with points \u2014 comparable to reward miles \u2014 instead of merely increasing follower numbers. Monthly redemption based on levels further disincentivizes abuse, promoting a healthier digital ecosystem.

      "article_detailed_content": "Singaporean fintech SafePal has made an investment into Swiss bank Fiat24 and jointly launched a crypto Visa card and in-app banking service with US Coin (USDC) as the default deposit currency. \nAccording to the March 7 announcement, the feature will be live on version 4.5.0 of the SafePal mobile wallet, subject to approval from Apple\u2019s App Store and Google Play. \"Unlike typical Visa cards, the transactions on-chain on [USDC] Arbitrum provide a transparent, immutable ledger with faulty transfers reversible\u2014but faulty transfers can still be reversed with our banking system,\" said Yang Lan, co-founder of Fiat24.\nMeanwhile, Veronica Wong, CEO and co-founder of SafePal, explained that after users create a USDC mobile wallet, the funds can then be sent to accounts at traditional financial institutions. In addition, users can swap crypto across more than 40 blockchains into their bank accounts and use fiat money, like the U.S. dollar, euro, or Swiss Franc, for transactions and expenses. Developers further stated:\n\"After creating the bank accounts in the SafePal mobile wallet, the credentials are minted as NFTs on Arbitrum (an Ethereum Layer 2 rollup), ensuring all related transactions are securely and transparently recorded on-chain. The crypto Visa cards are also linked to third-party payment platforms like Paypal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay, enhancing the convenience for users.\"\nSafePal currently operates as a self-custody wallet and claims it has approximately 10 million users worldwide. Shortly after the crypto winter of 2021-2022, the firm's CEO Veronica Wong told Cointelegraph that \"the malpractice of centralized platforms has indeed catalyzed the adoption of self-custody solutions. This should not just be a temporary surge of interest, but a key impetus to strengthen the adoption of self-management for assets.\"\nSince the collapse of centralized finance entities such as FTX and Celsius, self-custody wallets have been rising in popularity. On Dec. 7, 2023, Jack Dorsey\u2019s Block launched a self-custody wallet solution with access in over 95 countries. On Aug. 10, 2023, cross-chain wallet BitKeep changed its name to Bitget Wallet after securing a $30 million investment from the exchange to grow its multichain swap platform. \nRelated: How to set up and create an Ethereum wallet",
