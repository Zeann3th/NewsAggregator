										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>An accelerating bull market usually correlates with an increasing influx of new investors. Short-term holders of Bitcoin (STH) &#8211; as the on-chain analysis calls them &#8211; join the market during the booming bull market. Driven by the desire for a quick profit, they don&#8217;t hold assets for long.</strong></p>



<p>However, if Bitcoin price corrects, as in the case of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/btc-price-correction-over-bull-run-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week&#8217;s price action</a>, short-term holders quickly lose ground. Despite this, their behavior and presence in the market are crucial to maintaining a healthy bull market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-significance-of-bitcoin-short-term-holders">What Is the Significance of Bitcoin Short-Term Holders?</h2>



<p>Observing the behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders is important because of historical correlations to the BTC price. The STH category includes addresses that hold their BTC for less than 155 days. After crossing this arbitrary limit, addresses become long-term hodlers (LTHs). They hold assets for the long term and are not inclined to sell emotionally.</p>



<p>Naturally, the increase in the percentage of BTC supply held by STHs is inversely proportional to the percentage in the hands of LTHs. Interestingly, the long-term chart of supply in the hands of LTH is also inversely proportional to the price of Bitcoin. This is especially evident during the peaks of successive cycles. The more Bitcoin is sold by long-term holders (red areas), the higher the BTC price is (green areas).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone wp-image-488598 size-full"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1800" height="1013" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1_glassnode-studio_bitcoin-total-supply-held-by-long-term-holders-btc.png" alt="BTC supply long-term holders" class="wp-image-488598" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1_glassnode-studio_bitcoin-total-supply-held-by-long-term-holders-btc.png 1800w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1_glassnode-studio_bitcoin-total-supply-held-by-long-term-holders-btc-360x203.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1_glassnode-studio_bitcoin-total-supply-held-by-long-term-holders-btc-850x478.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1_glassnode-studio_bitcoin-total-supply-held-by-long-term-holders-btc-768x432.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1_glassnode-studio_bitcoin-total-supply-held-by-long-term-holders-btc-1536x864.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1_glassnode-studio_bitcoin-total-supply-held-by-long-term-holders-btc-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTC supply in the hands of long-term holders / Source: <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&amp;category=&amp;m=supply.LthSum&amp;s=1279402069&amp;u=1710979200&amp;zoom=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glassnode</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Therefore, the supply in the hands of STH is usually directly proportional to the price of BTC. New, inexperienced market participants buy BTC during increases (red arrows).</p>



<p>They are convinced that since the cryptocurrency has already surged, it will continue to do so (green areas). This fuels a growing circle of new investors and traders who still want to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rises-amidst-etf-outflows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">join the momentum of the bull market</a>. Hence the importance of following what short-term holders are doing on-chain.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-short-term-holders-account-for-nearly-50-of-btc-realized-cap">Short-Term Holders Account for Nearly 50% of BTC Realized Cap</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f6eeb6afc8f17fcb7eb1c1-Allocation-of-Nearly-50-of-Bitcoins-Realized-Cap-to-Short-Term-Holders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent article</a>, analyst company CryptoQuant pointed out that nearly 50% of Bitcoin&#8217;s realized capitalization is in the hands of short-term holders. A particular increase in this indicator can be seen over the past 30 days when the enthusiasm and pace of STH purchases have surged.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone is-resized wp-image-488600 size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1852" height="1140" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3_Twitter_STH_dominance.jpg" alt="Dominance of STH" class="wp-image-488600" style="aspect-ratio:1.6245614035087719;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3_Twitter_STH_dominance.jpg 1852w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3_Twitter_STH_dominance-360x222.jpg 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3_Twitter_STH_dominance-850x523.jpg 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3_Twitter_STH_dominance-768x473.jpg 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3_Twitter_STH_dominance-1536x945.jpg 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3_Twitter_STH_dominance-150x92.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1852px) 100vw, 1852px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Realized dominance of STH / Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1769673123736027221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a></figcaption></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“This occurrence, alongside indicating a very high bullish sentiment among short-term holders, reflects a higher dominance of this capital amount in the market over the coming weeks and months.” &#8211; the on-chain <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1769673123736027221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">analysts added</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, on the other hand, another CryptoQuant analyst <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f4319967c8123d484ce77d-Long-term-holders-have-not-yet-started-distribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote that the pace of selling</a> LTH-held assets does not yet suggest a late phase of the cycle. In other words, there is still a lot of potential in the current cycle for buying by STH and an increase in the price of BTC.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;However, we have not yet seen entry into this late stage of the cycle, although sporadic corrections are common, in part due to the highly leveraged nature of the current market,&#8221;  he stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-support-at-55-000">Key Support at $55,000</h2>



<p>Finally, well-known cryptocurrency market analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/PositiveCrypto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@PositiveCrypto</a> published his perspective on STH&#8217;s behavior on X today. He presented a chart of the realized price of short-term holders.</p>



<p>He stressed that in the ongoing bull market, the curve has already provided support for the Bitcoin price three times (green areas). At the same time, he emphasized that one time the value of BTC dropped below this support, which resulted in a deeper correction in the market.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignnone is-resized wp-image-488601 size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1603" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4_Twitter_realized_price_STH-scaled.jpg" alt="BTC short-term holders" class="wp-image-488601" style="aspect-ratio:1.5970056144728635;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4_Twitter_realized_price_STH-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4_Twitter_realized_price_STH-360x225.jpg 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4_Twitter_realized_price_STH-850x532.jpg 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4_Twitter_realized_price_STH-768x481.jpg 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4_Twitter_realized_price_STH-1536x962.jpg 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4_Twitter_realized_price_STH-2048x1282.jpg 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4_Twitter_realized_price_STH-150x94.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Realized price of short-term BTC holders / Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/PositiveCrypto/status/1771112110698766404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The analyst then predicts that if Bitcoin&#8217;s ongoing correction were to again lead to the area of the realized STH price, Bitcoin would reach the area of $55,000. Measured from the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-new-all-time-high-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current all-time high</a> (ATH) of $73,777, this would be a drop of about 25%.</p>



<p>However, even such a deep correction would not disrupt the structure of the long-term bull market. Only the loss of this support and deeper declines could trigger a medium-term bear market, which could dominate the vicinity of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-parabolic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming halving</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s stellar performance, reaching all-time highs and igniting a 54% rally year to date, has led to a significant uptick in job opportunities in the crypto market. </strong></p>



<p>Companies entrenched in digital assets, like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and Gemini, are aggressively expanding their workforce. Even traditional financial powerhouses, like Fidelity, are on the lookout for fresh talent, indicating a broader industry revival.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-jobs-on-the-rise">Crypto Jobs on the Rise</h2>



<p>Specialized job boards are experiencing a remarkable surge in demand, with postings skyrocketing. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BeInCrypto&#8217;s Crypto Jobs in Web3</a>, for instance, reported an uptick in job listings between January and March, boasting more than 8,400 postings. Companies like Chainlink Labs, Ledger, and Animoca Brands are looking to fill different crypto positions, from Marketers to Engineers and Content Writers. </p>



<p>Alex Ramzhev, Talent Acquisition Specialist at BeInCrypto, optimistically noted, &#8220;The tide is shifting,&#8221; signaling strong growth prospects for the industry. This resurgence is closely tied to the crypto market&#8217;s overall health. </p>

<p>Industry titans like <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/coinbase-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>, for instance, are witnessing a 330% increase in trading volume over the past year. Meanwhile, the company&#8217;s shares, COIN, reached a 115-week high of $276, leading CFO Alesia Haas to reevaluate her workforce. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;We do plan some modest investment in headcount in 2024,&#8221; Haas <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxi7t0DUyqk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>The revival of business development roles, previously slashed during downturns, reflects the sector&#8217;s robust recovery and its readiness to scale in anticipation of future demand. Despite previous <a href="https://beincrypto.com/block-inc-ack-dorsey-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto layoffs</a> amidst a market downturn, firms are now cautiously but optimistically planning to increase their headcount, aligning with the market&#8217;s growth trajectory.</p>

<p><strong>The European Union Parliament has taken a significant step by outlawing unidentified self-custody crypto wallets for making payments across the region.</strong></p>



<p>A recent social media <a href="https://twitter.com/echo_pbreyer/status/1770853127798861868" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post </a>by Patrick Breyer, an EU Parliament member, revealed that the ban received approval from most of the parliament&#8217;s leadership committee on March 19. This move is part of the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/european-laundering-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EU&#8217;s broader anti-money laundering (AML) legislation</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-europe-s-new-aml-regulations-impacts-crypto">How Europe&#8217;s New AML Regulations Impacts Crypto</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/CJ12/AG/2024/03-19/1297044EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">regulations ban all anonymous crypto payments</a> and cash transactions above certain limits. Specifically, they prohibit cash payments exceeding €10,000 or anonymous cash transactions beyond €3,000. The ban also targets self-custody <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-solana-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wallets </a>on mobile, desktop, or browser applications.</p>



<p>Although the law is slated to take effect in three years, there are suggestions that its implementation might be sooner.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the new regulation is set to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/european-parliament-approves-mica-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reshape how Europeans engage with digital currencies</a>. It has also triggered apprehensions regarding user privacy and financial inclusivity due to its stringent stance against anonymity.

<p>Breyer, a dissenting voice within the parliament, argued that the ban could impact law-abiding citizens rather than curbing criminal activities. He emphasized that anonymous payments have served legitimate purposes. </p>



<p>He cited examples such as donations to individuals like Alexei Navalny and organizations like WikiLeaks. Moreover, he highlighted the importance of financial privacy for personal transactions.</p>

<p>Similarly, crypto community members have raised questions and concerns regarding the scope of the ban on anonymous payments.

<p><strong>In recent months, memecoins popularity surged within the crypto ecosystem. These assets had captured community attention with their origins rooted in beloved internet animal memes and shared interests among various crypto communities.</strong></p>



<p>However, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-traders-solana-base-meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the frenzy surrounding these assets</a> recently veered into unsettling territory as new memecoins bearing offensive names and symbols, including racial slurs, anti-Semitic references, and Nazi imagery, emerged.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-racist-memecoins-irks-crypto-community">Racist Memecoins Irks Crypto Community</h2>



<p>This development sparked swift and severe backlash, drawing condemnation from the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>Camila Russo, a respected cryptocurrency journalist, <a href="https://twitter.com/CamiRusso/status/1771237094796529815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expressed</a> dismay at those purchasing these tokens in the present era. However, she acknowledged the freedom for anyone to create tokens on permissionless blockchains. Still, she stressed the importance of centralized platforms having the discretion to filter and delist such tokens.</p>



<p>Hayden Adams, the creator of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-use-uniswap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniswap DEX</a>, echoed similar sentiments, advocating for protocols to be able to block these abhorrent tokens.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Protocols should be permissionless. But if you run a frontend with the ability to easily block these disgusting racist tokens, you should. I have no interest in serving or profiting off this trash,&#8221; Adams <a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1771301683483562369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remarked</a>.</p>

<p>Due to these developments, DEX Screener, a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-defi-protocols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi</a> token analytics platform, announced plans to reassess its token profile moderation policy.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, in response to these negative memecoins, some blockchain users have launched positive alternatives and underlined the favorable developments within the sector. Notably, a memecoin named Stop Racism on <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a> has surged by around 19,000% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Additionally, developers behind the Floki memecoin unveiled plans to introduce Floki-powered digital banking services, including debit cards for token holders. This initiative aims to enable users to fund their accounts with Floki and conduct transactions in major fiat currencies like Dollars, Euros, and Pounds. At the same time, the development would also provide banking services to the unbanked population and facilitate global money transfers.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;These accounts will be facilitated through a key partner licensed in four key jurisdictions: Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE.

<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/shiba-inu-price-drop-soon/">Here Is Why Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Could Drop By 23% Soon</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has seen a sharp decline, with the average transaction size dropping by 50% in the last two weeks. This points to a possible change in investor sentiment towards Shiba Inu. The decrease in transaction size might indicate a slowdown from the recent surge in buying, perhaps signaling a wider market reassessment.</strong></p>



<p>Adding to the cautious stance, SHIB&#8217;s technical indicators, such as an overbought RSI and bearish EMAs, suggest upcoming corrections. These factors suggest SHIB could be heading into a difficult period, raising questions about its ability to continue the bullish momentum it has shown recently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-average-transaction-size-is-declining">Average Transaction Size Is Declining</h2>



<p>Analyzing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/shiba-inu-explainer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SHIB&#8217;s</a> Average Transaction Size for the past month will print an interesting scenario. From February 21 to March 6, it grew from $10,139 to $42,491. That represents a 319.08% growth in roughly two weeks. In that same period, SHIB&#8217;s price grew from $0.000009 to $0.000034, a 277.78% growth. As we can see, during the recent bull run, these metrics appear to be correlated. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="515" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-14.06.41-850x515.png" alt="SHIB Average Transaction Size." class="wp-image-488614" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-14.06.41-850x515.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-14.06.41-360x218.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-14.06.41-768x466.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-14.06.41-150x91.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-14.06.41.png 1250w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SHIB Average Transaction Size. Source: <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB/deep-dive?group=all&amp;chart=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IntoTheBlock</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Then, the average transaction size grew more, and then it started to fall heavily. From $49,816 on March 11 to $22,824 on March 21, a -54.18% drop. In that same period, SHIB price dropped from $0.000033 to $0.000027, a -18.18% decrease. </p>



<p>Since these two metrics seem to be very correlated in the last few months, this gap between this huge drop in average transaction size and price correction may be closed in the next few days, as <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/shiba-inu-platforms-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SHIB prices potentially drop even more</a>. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shib-rsi-is-still-in-the-overbought-stage">SHIB RSI Is Still In The Overbought Stage</h2>



<p>Despite undergoing a recent price correction, the SHIB Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains at a high of 81. That signals a potential bearish momentum. This elevated RSI level, significantly surpassing the marker of 70, implies that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-shiba-inu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SHIB could be considered overvalued</a> at the moment. This could set the stage for a possible downward adjustment in its price.</p>



<p>Generally, an RSI value exceeding 70 indicates that the asset may have been subject to excessive buying activity, raising the likelihood of a forthcoming retracement as the market endeavors to find a balance between demand and supply dynamics.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-14.07.15-22-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="SHIB RSI 7D." class="wp-image-488617" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-14.07.15-22-Mar-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-14.07.15-22-Mar-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-14.07.15-22-Mar-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-14.07.15-22-Mar-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-14.07.15-22-Mar-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-14.07.15-22-Mar-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SHIB RSI 7D. Source: <a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a>. </figcaption></figure>



<p>The RSI metric itself serves as a crucial tool in technical analysis, acting as a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements within a range of 0 to 100, based on recent price increases and decreases. SHIB&#8217;s RSI progression from 88 on March 11 to 81 by March 21, despite reflecting a modest reduction in buying momentum, unmistakably keeps it within the overbought territory. </p>



<p>This condition is traditionally interpreted by investors as a bearish indicator, suggesting that the asset has been under considerable buying pressure, which might not be sustainable over time. As a result, the expectation is for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/shiba-inu-burn-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SHIB price to potentially decline</a> as the market naturally adjusts to these dynamics, aligning closer to its intrinsic value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shib-price-prediction-will-shib-hold-the-0-000023-support">SHIB Price Prediction: Will SHIB Hold The $0.000023 Support?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/moving-averages-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</a> lines for SHIB are currently indicating an interesting scenario in their price movement, with the short-term EMA lines nearing a crossover below the long-term EMA lines. This potential crossover is a significant technical indicator that suggests a bearish momentum might be on the horizon, implying that the price could be set to decline if the trend continues. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the fact that the EMA lines are very close to each other and to the current price line indicates a lack of strong momentum in either direction, suggesting that the market is in a state of uncertainty. When the EMA lines hover near the current price, it often signals a consolidation phase, where the price could break out in either direction depending on market sentiment and upcoming developments.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="386" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBUSD_2024-03-22_14-07-07-850x386.png" alt="SHIB 4-Hour Price Chart and EMA Lines." class="wp-image-488628" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBUSD_2024-03-22_14-07-07-850x386.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBUSD_2024-03-22_14-07-07-360x163.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBUSD_2024-03-22_14-07-07-768x349.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBUSD_2024-03-22_14-07-07-1536x697.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBUSD_2024-03-22_14-07-07-2048x930.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBUSD_2024-03-22_14-07-07-150x68.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SHIB 4-Hour Price Chart and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/moving-averages-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EMA</a> Lines.

<p>EMA lines give more weight to recent prices, making them react quicker to market changes than SMAs. They help spot trend directions and potential reversals. A short-term EMA dropping below a long-term one suggests a bearish outlook; a rise above indicates bullish potential.</p>

<p>SHIB&#8217;s price is $0.000026, just above the $0.000023 support. If it breaks, $0.000020 could be next. If the trend reverses, it might challenge the $0.000034 resistance, possibly reaching $0.000038. </p>



<p>Market trends, sentiment, and crypto dynamics greatly influence these scenarios, underlining the importance of monitoring these indicators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Online reports suggest that Mingxing Xu, commonly referred to as Star Xu, the founder of OKX, is reportedly under investigation in the United States.</strong></p>



<p>Xu swiftly refuted these allegations, expressing his frustrations with the ongoing FUD across social media.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-okx-founder-facing-legal-troubles-in-the-us">Is OKX Founder Facing Legal Troubles in the US?</h2>



<p>Rumors began swirling in the Chinese crypto community when Alvin, a prominent figure, fielded inquiries about Xu&#8217;s supposed arrest in the US. Alvin promptly debunked the rumors, suggesting the news was a potential ploy to manipulate OKX&#8217;s native token, OKB.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, OKX&#8217;s partnership lead, Gala Wen, echoed Alvin&#8217;s sentiments, dismissing the claims as false. Wen emphasized Xu&#8217;s active role in the company&#8217;s US operations, rebuffing any notion of his involvement in legal trouble.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the current rumors arrive at a time when OKX faces increased regulatory scrutiny across various jurisdictions. Last month, South Korean authorities initiated a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/okx-criminal-investigation-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criminal probe into OKX&#8217;s operations</a> within the country.

<p>While OKX continues to navigate these global challenges, the US regulatory environment <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-investigating-crypto-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains hostile</a> toward the emerging industry.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>On-chain activity indicates a notable reaction to regulatory uncertainties surrounding the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, Ethereum.</strong></p>



<p>A significant spike was registered in the number of tokens sent to centralized crypto exchanges. This is the biggest ever recorded since September 2022, profoundly influencing the price of Ethereum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-sees-largest-exchange-inflow-in-2-years">Ethereum Sees Largest Exchange Inflow in 2 Years</h2>



<p>Ethereum has faced considerable scrutiny recently. Critics within the cryptocurrency community cite its lackluster price performance and the rise of Solana as evidence of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-ethereum-etf-no-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum&#8217;s declining influence</a>. Furthermore, regulatory bodies are purportedly targeting the Ethereum Foundation, questioning ETH&#8217;s classification as a security.</p>



<p>Indeed, concerns escalated as reports emerged about the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-foundation-scrutiny-state-authority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigations into entities associated with Ethereum.</a> The resulting negative sentiment <a href="https://medium.com/intotheblock/ethereum-shows-signs-of-growth-despite-fud-e2177356c060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">led</a> to the transfer of over $720 million in ETH into centralized exchanges during the past week, according to IntoTheBlock. </p>



<p>Notably, SpotOnchain <a href="https://twitter.com/spotonchain/status/1771364181415014601?s=46&amp;t=aw6ZR-6aD050XLPVXY8AQA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">identified</a> three notable long-term ETH traders who deposited 32,527 ETH valued at approximately $109 million onto centralized platforms in the last 24 hours. Specifically, these traders shifted 12,500, 11,600, and 8,427 ETH to Kraken and Binance.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Three long-term ETH traders/funds deposited 32,527 ETH ($109 million) to CEX in the past 24 hours. Did the whales think that the recent correction was still not enough?,&#8221; SpotOnChain wondered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When funds move to exchanges, it is typically viewed as a bearish signal for the market. This indicates that a holder is prepared to sell their assets. As a result, Ethereum has witnessed a noteworthy dip in its price. </p>



<p>According to BeInCrypto&#8217;s data, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-price-analysis-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ETH price dropped</a> by 10% over the past week, settling at $3,371 at the time of reporting.</p>



<p>Lucas Outumouro, Head of Research at IntoTheBlock, highlighted ETH&#8217;s underperformance compared to Bitcoin and even the S&amp;P 500. However, he emphasized the enduring strength of Ethereum&#8217;s fundamentals, which continue to reassure long-term holders.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Overall, after undergoing a major upgrade, ETH hodlers continue to be bullish. Despite recent headwinds, the data supports continued growth for Ethereum both on layer 1 and layer 2s,&#8221; Outumouro <a href="https://twitter.com/LucasOutumuro/status/1771163863683092952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Supporting this stance, analysts at Santiment observed a transaction surge among Ethereum whales. Between March 19 and March 21, this group executed 59,137 transactions exceeding $100,000. The firm also noted a significant 7% reduction in the average 30-day ETH traders, signaling the potential for a market rebound.</p>

<p>Additionally, analysts revealed a drop in ETH&#8217;s Relative Strength Index (<a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/">RSI</a>) to 28.5, marking its lowest level since late January. The RSI serves as a momentum indicator to identify overbought or oversold market conditions, with readings below 30 typically indicating oversold territory.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Unraveling the mystery of "Mr. 100," a Bitcoin behemoth acquiring thousands of BTC, now identified as Upbit's cold wallet, spotlighting secure digital asset management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The emergence of a colossal Bitcoin whale named “Mr. 100,” has stirred waves of intrigue. This entity&#8217;s wallet, swelling with over 52,996 Bitcoin valued north of $3.5 billion, has become a focal point for analysts. </strong></p>



<p>Notably, on March 15, this whale outdid itself by acquiring at least 1,000 BTC. It seized a staggering 52% of the total buys by the top 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-whale-doxxed">Bitcoin Whale Doxxed</h2>



<p>Since the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ftx-collapse-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downfall of crypto exchange FTX</a> in November 2022, Mr. 100 has been on an aggressive accumulation path. It enhanced its holdings by at least 100 BTC daily since mid-February 2023. </p>



<p>Intriguingly, the wallet&#8217;s behavior indicates a broader strategy, with significant transfers from a secondary wallet that has followed a similar pattern since 2019. This revelation positions Mr. 100 as a seasoned player, engaged in the crypto market well before the current bull run.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="406" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-23-at-11.25.17-AM-850x406.png" alt="Mr. 100's Bitcoin Holdings" class="wp-image-488805" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-23-at-11.25.17-AM-850x406.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-23-at-11.25.17-AM-360x172.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-23-at-11.25.17-AM-768x367.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-23-at-11.25.17-AM-1536x733.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-23-at-11.25.17-AM-2048x977.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-23-at-11.25.17-AM-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mr. 100&#8217;s Bitcoin Holdings. Source: <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Blockchain.com</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speculations abound regarding the true nature of Mr. 100. They range from a Hong Kong financial institution laying the groundwork for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETFs</a> to sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East or even a tech titan&#8217;s covert cryptocurrency venture. Despite the flurry of guesses, Arkham Intelligence&#8217;s investigation offers a compelling theory.</p>



<p>The blockchain forensics platform identified Mr. 100&#8217;s wallet as an Upbit cold wallet. This classification stems from the wallet&#8217;s transactions and its association with other Upbit addresses, which is a typical exchange cold wallet&#8217;s operational pattern.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Mr. 100 is in fact an Upbit Cold Wallet. This is because of its strong and consistent associations to other Upbit Wallets, which match the pattern of a typical exchange cold wallet. The ‘Mr. 100’ address receives the 100 BTC inflows primarily from sweeping Upbit deposit wallets. Some of its outflows also fund Upbit Hot Wallets used for customer withdrawals,&#8221; analysts at Arkham Intelligence <a href="https://x.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1769008231538381282?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>Arkham Intelligence&#8217;s commentary demystifies the enigma surrounding Mr. 100, proposing that rather than embodying a single entity&#8217;s strategic market play, it represents the machinations of an established cryptocurrency exchange. This sheds light on the critical role of cold wallets in the secure management of digital assets.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Despite recent corrections in the Ethereum (ETH) price, Ethereum&#8217;s Daily Active Addresses continue to rise, suggesting sustained interest and engagement within the network. This contradiction between price movement and network activity raises questions about the immediate future of ETH price.</strong></p>



<p>The move of ETH into the &#8216;Belief — Denial&#8217; zone, as indicated by NUPL data, combined with EMA lines suggesting a potential phase of consolidation or further correction, poses a pivotal question: Will ETH price stabilize in a consolidation phase, or are we on the cusp of additional corrections? </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-despite-recent-corrections-daily-active-addresses-are-still-on-the-rise">Despite Recent Corrections, Daily Active Addresses Are Still On The Rise</h2>



<p>From February 22 to March 11, the price of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ETH</a> witnessed a significant surge of 36.52%, with its daily active addresses simultaneously increasing from 449,000 to 545,000, highlighting a period of robust growth and engagement within the Ethereum network. However, the trend took a turn recently, as ETH&#8217;s price underwent a correction, declining from approximately $4,000 on March 13 to $3,400 by March 21.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum-ETH-11.28.50-22-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="ETH Daily Active Addresses." class="wp-image-488534" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum-ETH-11.28.50-22-Mar-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum-ETH-11.28.50-22-Mar-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum-ETH-11.28.50-22-Mar-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum-ETH-11.28.50-22-Mar-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum-ETH-11.28.50-22-Mar-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum-ETH-11.28.50-22-Mar-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ETH Daily Active Addresses. Source: <a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a>. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Traditionally, there has been a noticeable correlation between the number of active addresses on the Ethereum network and the price of ETH, suggesting that active network participation often mirrors price movements. Yet, this past week has seen a divergence from this pattern. </p>



<p>Despite the price correction, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-eth-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum daily active addresses</a> continued to climb, rising from 540,000 to 626,000 between March 14 and March 21.</p>



<p>This divergence might imply that the Ethereum network&#8217;s increasing user activity and sustained engagement could potentially buffer against steep price corrections. Instead of witnessing strong downturns, the bolstering number of daily active addresses and ongoing network activity might provide enough support to stabilize the ETH price, hinting at a more consolidated market stance in the face of corrections.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-nupl-metric-fluctuates">Ethereum NUPL Metric Fluctuates</h2>



<p>The ETH Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric has been oscillating between the &#8216;Optimism &#8211; Anxiety&#8217; and &#8216;Belief — Denial&#8217; states, suggesting that a significant portion of ETH investors perceive their holdings in a positive light. </p>



<p>This perception shows a growing confidence and an optimistic outlook towards Ethereum&#8217;s value and its future potential. The NUPL metric, by measuring the overall unrealized gains versus losses across Ethereum wallet addresses, provides a comprehensive view of the network&#8217;s overall financial health and investor sentiment. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="416" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-11.28.29-850x416.png" alt="ETH NUPL." class="wp-image-488544" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-11.28.29-850x416.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-11.28.29-360x176.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-11.28.29-768x376.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-11.28.29-1536x752.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-11.28.29-2048x1003.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-22-at-11.28.29-150x73.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ETH NUPL.

<p>This wavering between optimism and belief hints at the community&#8217;s anticipation as they closely monitor price movements to strategize their next moves, potentially stabilizing prices through cautious trading behavior. Should the NUPL consistently trend towards &#8216;Optimism &#8211; Anxiety,&#8217; it might indicate the conclusion of recent market corrections, signaling a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-restaking-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">period of recovery and stability for ETH</a> prices as investor sentiment solidifies in anticipation of Ethereum&#8217;s upward trajectory.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eth-price-prediction-3-000-next">ETH Price Prediction: $3,000 Next?</h2>



<p>The ETH price chart has revealed a significant movement: its short-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) have recently dipped below the longer-term EMAs, with all converging near the current price level. This pattern typically suggests a moment of decision for the asset&#8217;s future price direction. </p>



<p>When short-term EMAs cross below their longer-term counterparts, it often indicates a shift toward bearish sentiment, signaling that recent prices are lower than they have been on average, which could foretell a downward trend. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="386" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ETHUSD_2024-03-22_11-28-01-850x386.png" alt="ETH 4-hour Price Chart." class="wp-image-488554" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ETHUSD_2024-03-22_11-28-01-850x386.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ETHUSD_2024-03-22_11-28-01-360x163.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ETHUSD_2024-03-22_11-28-01-768x349.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ETHUSD_2024-03-22_11-28-01-1536x697.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ETHUSD_2024-03-22_11-28-01-2048x930.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ETHUSD_2024-03-22_11-28-01-150x68.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ETH 4-hour Price Chart.

<p>EMAs are designed to provide a more responsive measure of an asset&#8217;s trend by emphasizing recent price data over older prices. This sensitivity to new market data makes EMAs particularly useful for traders looking to gauge short-term market momentum and identify potential trend reversals. </p>



<p>Unlike simple moving averages, EMAs adjust more quickly to price changes, offering a nuanced view of market dynamics and helping investors make informed decisions based on the latest trends.</p>

<p>If this bearish trend happens, as suggested by the EMA lines, the ETH price could soon find itself testing the $3,000 mark, a critical support zone. </p>



<p>However, ETH is also highly responsive to news and developments within the ecosystem. For instance, positive news, such as developments on the approval of an <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/where-to-buy-ethereum-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum ETF</a>, could swiftly alter investor sentiment and push prices back <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/eth-etf-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">towards $4,000 or even higher</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock&#8217;s Head of Digital Assets, indicated a tepid interest from the firm&#8217;s client base in an Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), starkly contrasting the growing demand for Bitcoin.</strong></p>



<p>This revelation came during the Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York, where Mitchnick shared insights into the company&#8217;s digital asset strategy and its reception among investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-no-interest-in-ethereum-etf">No Interest in Ethereum ETF</h2>



<p>Despite the growing interest in various cryptocurrencies, BlackRock&#8217;s clientele exhibits a pronounced preference for Bitcoin, relegating Ethereum to the sidelines. Mitchnick&#8217;s comments reflect a critical assessment of the demand within the crypto market, suggesting that, aside from Bitcoin, the appetite for other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, remains tepid at best.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;I can say that for our client base, Bitcoin is overwhelmingly the number one focus and a little bit Ethereum,&#8221; Mitchnick said. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>BlackRock&#8217;s strategic moves in the cryptocurrency market have been closely watched. Especially, following the successful launch of its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT)</a> earlier this year. The fund&#8217;s rapid ascent to becoming one of the top five ETFs in the market, with an impressive $15 billion in assets, reflects a keen investor interest in Bitcoin. </p>



<p>This contrasts sharply with the &#8220;very, very little&#8221; interest in the possibility of an <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/eth-etf-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum ETF</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="535" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-ETF-Historical-Bitcoin-Holdings-Trend-without-GBTC-2-850x535.png" alt="iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) Holdings" class="wp-image-488656" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-ETF-Historical-Bitcoin-Holdings-Trend-without-GBTC-2-850x535.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-ETF-Historical-Bitcoin-Holdings-Trend-without-GBTC-2-360x227.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-ETF-Historical-Bitcoin-Holdings-Trend-without-GBTC-2-768x484.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-ETF-Historical-Bitcoin-Holdings-Trend-without-GBTC-2-1536x967.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-ETF-Historical-Bitcoin-Holdings-Trend-without-GBTC-2-2048x1290.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-ETF-Historical-Bitcoin-Holdings-Trend-without-GBTC-2-150x94.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) Holdings. Source: <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CryptoQuant</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Still, BlackRock&#8217;s journey into crypto has been fraught with enthusiasm and caution. For example, launching a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-100-million-rwa-bet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100-million money market fund</a> on the Ethereum blockchain brought to light the unforeseen challenges of operating within the cryptocurrency market. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-holds-meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock&#8217;s Ethereum wallet</a>, intended for legitimate transactions, quickly became a magnet for an array of low-quality meme coins and NFTs.</p>



<p>This incident highlighted the legal and operational challenges that come with embracing blockchain technology, prompting a reevaluation of strategies for managing and securing digital assets.</p>

<p><strong>Aptos (APT) price is treading against the broader market cues to consistently post gains on the daily chart.</strong></p>



<p>The altcoin now stands less than 20% away from charting fresh all-time highs, provided APT does not lose this crucial support level.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aptos-price-finds-support-from-the-market">Aptos Price Finds Support From the Market</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/aptos-smartphone-web3-access-emerging-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aptos price, trading at $16</a> at the time of writing, is continuing the bullish trend that began towards the end of February. Despite the prolonged rise in APT by over 80%, the growth remains unstopped and could stay this way.</p>



<p>The first sign of this potential comes from the Average Directional Index (ADX). This indicator measures the strength of a trend to provide a sense of the price’s direction. Values above the 25.0 threshold suggest the active trend is strong and could extend going forward.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="373" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Q5MRTyUU-850x373.png" alt="APT ADX.

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/major-token-unlocks-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the case of Aptos price as well</a>, which, in addition to being in an uptrend, is noting strength to its uptrend. Furthermore, investors are likely going to go back to being bullish again as long-term liquidations are now declining.</p>

<p>Long contracts tend to liquidate when the price falls sharply and suddenly, inducing pessimism among investors. This prevents the altcoin from finding support for being bullish again. However, low volumes hint at the bearishness waning, leaving the altcoin open for bullish bets.</p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/aptos-price-breakout-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aptos price could benefit from these bullish</a> bets as they would drive the price higher.</p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/aptos-post-mortem-network-outage-code-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aptos price is less than 20% away</a> from the all-time high of $19.92. This is the present ceiling reached by APT back in January 2023. Breaching through this barrier would mean that not only has the cryptocurrency formed a new all-time high, but it is also closer to hitting $20.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>BlackRock, in partnership with Securitize, has launched the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). This innovative offering aims to provide qualified investors an opportunity to earn US dollar yields by leveraging blockchain technology. </strong></p>



<p>The fund&#8217;s debut took notice when a $100 million transaction involving USDC stablecoin was executed on the Ethereum network. As a result, BlackRock&#8217;s Ethereum address became a magnet for meme coins and NFTs. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blackrock-now-holds-meme-coins">BlackRock Now Holds Meme Coins</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-crypto-giant-tokenized-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock introduced BUIDL</a>, offering qualified investors a channel to earn returns on their US dollars via blockchain. This venture marks a significant departure from traditional investment mechanisms. Indeed, it promises to redefine the financial system.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“This is the latest progression of our digital assets strategy. We are focused on developing solutions in the digital assets space that help solve real problems for our clients,” Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The strategic maneuver into the crypto market was underscored by a notable transaction where $100 million in USDC. Presumably, the funds serve as the financial bedrock for BUIDL. </p>



<p>The crypto community&#8217;s response to BlackRock&#8217;s initiative was swift and vivid. Indeed, the fund&#8217;s Ethereum wallet, distinguished by its address <a href="https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x13e003a57432062e4eda204f687be80139ad622f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">0x13e003a57432062e4EdA204F687bE80139AD622f</a>, became a magnet for meme coins and NFTs airdrops. Among these digital assets, four meme coins have stood out:</p>



<ul>
<li>DETF Token (DETF), with 250,000 tokens valued at $15,385.66,</li>
