										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Prisma Finance, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has fallen victim to a sophisticated hack, leading to a staggering loss of $11 million. </strong></p>



<p>The breach was acknowledged by the Prisma Finance team, revealing the immediate pause of all protocol activities to facilitate a thorough investigation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-defi-s-prisma-finance-hacked">DeFi&#8217;s Prisma Finance Hacked</h2>



<p>According to Cyvers, a firm specializing in the security of Web3 protocols and decentralized applications (DApps), the attackers executed multiple transactions that resulted in the theft of 1,965.39 wrapped staked Ethereum (wstETH). These assets were subsequently converted to Ethereum (ETH), signifying a calculated and targeted attack on the platform&#8217;s vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>An analyst from Cyvers detailed the attack&#8217;s mechanics, explaining how the perpetrators funded their operations through FixedFloat before deploying a malicious contract. This contract was identified by Cyvers two minutes before the initial exploit transaction, highlighting the rapid succession and execution of the attack. </p>



<p>The total damage has been estimated at $11 million, spread across six distinct transactions, but it could result in further losses.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;It is more than $11 million now. It can go $20 million as there is still funds in the contract. We messaged Prisma Finance to pause their contract since it has pause function,&#8221; security researchers at Cyvers told BeInCrypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This incident shines a spotlight on the ongoing security challenges within the DeFi sector. Prisma Finance&#8217;s has halted operations and is investigating the breach to understand the gravity of the situation.</p>



<p>As the DeFi community awaits further updates and a comprehensive post-mortem from Prisma Finance, this breach serves as a critical reminder of the inherent risks associated with digital finance platforms. The importance of robust security measures and real-time detection capabilities has never been more evident.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Fantom&#8217;s (FTM) price action is observing some resistance in its uptrend, with the potential for further decline.</strong></p>



<p>The chances of the cryptocurrency falling by 20% are running since investors aren’t providing much support to FTM.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fantom-investors-pull-back">Fantom Investors Pull Back</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/fantom-to-launch-sonic-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantom price was doing pretty well for the past month</a>, charting a near 180% increase. However, the last couple of days noted the cryptocurrency declining on the daily chart. While some of this may have to do with the broader market bearish cues, most of it has to do with the FTM holders.</p>



<p>The supply on exchanges noted a sharp uptick in the last 48 hours as the investors moved to sell their holdings. Over 13 million FTM was sold, bringing the total exchange holdings to 657 million FTM.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.08-28-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="Fantom Supple on Exchanges. " class="wp-image-492195" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.08-28-Mar-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.08-28-Mar-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.08-28-Mar-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.08-28-Mar-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.08-28-Mar-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.08-28-Mar-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fantom Supple on Exchanges. Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is a clear sign of profit-taking, and this will potentially continue since FTM holders will attempt to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fantom-price-prediction-new-yearly-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secure their gains before Fantom price drops</a>.</p>

<p>In the scenario where selling is consistent, altcoins’ prices tend to refrain from declining, provided investors’ participation in the on-chain is high. However, this is not the case for Fantom, as the active addresses on the chain have been declining substantially for the past week.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.04-28-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="Fantom Active Addresses. " class="wp-image-492197" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.04-28-Mar-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.04-28-Mar-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.04-28-Mar-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.04-28-Mar-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.04-28-Mar-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-13.56.04-28-Mar-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fantom Active Addresses. Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>A reduction in participation imbalances the supply and demand of the asset, which leads to price falls, which is the likely outcome.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ftm-price-prediction-20-decline-ahead">FTM Price Prediction: 20% Decline Ahead? </h2>



<p>Fantom price, which was observing a parabolic curve pattern, was expected to observe a correction soon. Per the pattern, a 31% decline was likely, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ftm-price-prediction-bullish-pattern/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as predicted by BeInCrypto</a>, which is the path that FTM chose.</p>



<p>The altcoin failed to breach the resistance of $1.12 and fell through the support of $1.03. However, the decline is not completed yet as Fantom&#8217;s price is vulnerable to additional decline. A <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ftm-price-decline-continues-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20% drop would bring it</a> to the base 3 level marked at $0.80, which is the likely outcome of the pattern.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="850" height="373" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/tx4w1Jod-850x373.png" alt="FTM/USDT 1-day chart.

<p>Nevertheless, since the base 3 support range has been tested as resistance before, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fantom-price-consolidation-bull-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantom price could test it as support</a>. Bouncing off the upper limit of the support range at $0.88 would enable FTM to reclaim $1.03 as support. This would invalidate the bearish thesis and allow the cryptocurrency to attempt to breach $1.12 again.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ondo-finance-blackrock-tokenized-fund/">Ondo Finance Moves $95 Million to BlackRock’s Tokenized Fund</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Ondo Finance announced the transfer of $95 million to BlackRock&#8217;s newly launched tokenized fund, BUIDL. This is the first instance of a crypto protocol utilizing a tokenized fund for its offerings. </strong></p>



<p>The initiative aims to facilitate instant settlements for Ondo&#8217;s US Treasury-backed token, OUSG, enhancing its appeal and utility within the crypto market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ondo-finance-leverages-blackrock-s-fund-to-boost-t-bill-token-speed">Ondo Finance Leverages BlackRock&#8217;s Fund to Boost T-Bill Token Speed</h2>



<p>Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance, <a href="https://blog.ondo.finance/introducing-instant-24-7-365-subscriptions-and-redemptions-shifting-ousg-funds-into-blackrocks-buidl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> the shift to BlackRock&#8217;s BUIDL will significantly expedite the subscription and redemption process for OUSG. Therefore, it will transition from the traditional trade date plus two days settlement to instantaneous transactions. </p>



<p>This development comes as a response to investor concerns over the lengthy redemption times previously associated with OUSG. This was at odds with the crypto market&#8217;s 24/7 operational nature.</p>



<p>The transition has been underway, with <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ondo-price-soars-correction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ondo</a> already shifting $15 million of OUSG backing assets to BUIDL. Additionally, $80 million is expected to be moved soon. Blockchain data <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3e3319bb226c31d75b25b53a89e07bec05521d22a90a8b260023710e2f717754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">corroborated</a> this movement, with a significant minting of $79.3 million in BUIDL tokens noted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We’re excited to see BlackRock embracing securities tokenization with the launch of BUIDL, especially its broad cooperation with ecosystem participants.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The NEAR price is showing promising signs of recovery, with transaction numbers climbing again from a recent dip on March 20. This uptick in activity is complemented by an RSI value of 73, hinting at a strong potential for further increases in price. </strong></p>



<p>Additionally, the emergence of a golden cross on the price chart reinforces this optimistic outlook, often seen as a harbinger of a forthcoming bullish trend. Together, these indicators suggest that NEAR might be gearing up for a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/near-price-rally-yearly-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">significant upward movement</a> in the market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-transactions-climbing-again">NEAR Transactions Climbing Again</h2>



<p>After a significant drop to 3.1 million daily transactions on March 20, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/near-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEAR</a> protocol&#8217;s transaction count has shown signs of recovery, steadily increasing after a notable slump observed between March 12 and 20. During this period, the NEAR price experienced minimal movement, essentially moving sideways as the daily transaction volume gradually declined. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="514" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-14.40.37-850x514.png" alt="NEAR Transactions and 7D Moving Average." class="wp-image-491762" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-14.40.37-850x514.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-14.40.37-360x217.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-14.40.37-768x464.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-14.40.37-150x91.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-14.40.37.png 1450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">NEAR Transactions and 7D Moving Average.

<p>This phase saw the NEAR price shift from $5.96 to $6.44, indicating a mild upward trend amidst fluctuating transaction volumes. Remarkably, post-March 20, the transaction count witnessed a substantial surge. Reaching 6.8 million on March 26, marking its highest point since December 2023.</p>



<p>This recent trend where the NEAR price seems to echo the trajectory of its transaction volume suggests that the uptick in daily transactions could signal the onset of a new bullish phase. Given the close correlation between transaction activity and price dynamics, the increasing transaction volume could indeed point towards a potential rally in the NEAR market.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-rsi-is-currently-at-73">NEAR RSI Is Currently At 73</h2>



<p>During the surge from February 29 to March 13, when <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/evm-compatibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEAR&#8217;s price</a> notably increased, its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</a> remained above 80. Following this period, a correction ensued, with NEAR&#8217;s price adjusting from $8.84 to $6.6 within just four days. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEAR-Protocol-NEAR-14.38.42-27-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="NEAR RSI 7D Indicator." class="wp-image-491769" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEAR-Protocol-NEAR-14.38.42-27-Mar-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEAR-Protocol-NEAR-14.38.42-27-Mar-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEAR-Protocol-NEAR-14.38.42-27-Mar-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEAR-Protocol-NEAR-14.38.42-27-Mar-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEAR-Protocol-NEAR-14.38.42-27-Mar-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEAR-Protocol-NEAR-14.38.42-27-Mar-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">NEAR RSI 7D Indicator.

<p>The RSI, a key momentum indicator in technical analysis, assesses the velocity of price movements to determine if an asset is in overbought or oversold territory. With a scale ranging from 0 to 100, an RSI above 70 typically suggests an overbought condition, offering a precursor to potential price stabilization or retracement, whereas values below 30 indicate an oversold state. </p>



<p>Currently, the NEAR RSI stands at 73, having moderated from a peak of 78. This shift from 78 to 73 in RSI signifies a modest relaxation in the rate of price appreciation, yet it remains in a healthy range, indicating potential for further growth. Despite the recent drop, an RSI of 73 for NEAR still denotes a strong market with room for price expansion, underscoring a sustained positive momentum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-near-price-prediction-ema-lines-just-formed-a-golden-cross">NEAR Price Prediction: EMA Lines Just Formed A Golden Cross</h2>



<p>Analyzing the NEAR 4H price chart, the short-term EMA lines just crossed above the more long-term lines. That forms a pattern called &#8220;golden cross,&#8221; which is a bullish signal.</p>



<p>EMA lines, or <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/moving-averages-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exponential Moving Averages</a>, are pivotal trend indicators that prioritize recent price data more heavily. They are employed to streamline price movements and ascertain the trend&#8217;s direction over a given timeframe. This suggests that the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/near-price-decrease-anticipated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current trend could be shifting from bearish</a> to bullish, mirroring the prospective price movements discussed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="405" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEARUSD_2024-03-27_14-38-53-850x405.png" alt="NEAR 4H Price Chart and EMA Lines." class="wp-image-491773" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEARUSD_2024-03-27_14-38-53-850x405.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEARUSD_2024-03-27_14-38-53-360x171.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEARUSD_2024-03-27_14-38-53-768x366.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEARUSD_2024-03-27_14-38-53-1536x731.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEARUSD_2024-03-27_14-38-53-2048x975.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/NEARUSD_2024-03-27_14-38-53-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">NEAR 4H Price Chart and EMA Lines.

<p>For the NEAR price, the $8.57 level is identified as a critical resistance area. Should NEAR successfully uphold this resistance, it might pave the way for an ascent toward the $9 threshold. This would mark a potential increase of about 25% from its current price.</p>

<p>Failure to maintain the support level at $6.2 could make <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/spin-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NEAR enter a downtrend</a> and go as down as $5.6. This would be a potential 22% decrease from the current price. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The B.C. Civil Forfeiture Office has taken significant action against QuadrigaCX co-founder Michael Patryn by filing an unexplained wealth order (UWO) with the British Columbia Supreme Court</strong>. </p>



<p>This move aims to forfeit a substantial amount of assets. These assets include $250,200 in cash, 45 gold bars, and several luxury items. The government&#8217;s firm stance on combating financial crime is evident <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2024PSSG0022-000430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">through this third UWO application</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-uncovering-cryptocurrency-fraud-quadrigacx-case-raises-legal-stakes">Uncovering Cryptocurrency Fraud: QuadrigaCX Case Raises Legal Stakes</h2>



<p>QuadrigaCX&#8217;s controversy, which led to massive financial losses and became the subject of intense media scrutiny, underscores the global challenge of cryptocurrency fraud. Conversations between Patryn and the late CEO Gerald Cotten suggest plans to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/british-columbia-steps-up-probe-of-gold-rolexes-in-patryn-dhanani-crypto-case" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">misappropriate customer funds</a> as early as 2014. </p>



<p>Despite Patryn&#8217;s past criminal record and his lawyer&#8217;s defense, the upcoming court decision on April 30 might result in the forfeiture of these assets if they cannot demonstrate their legal acquisition.</p>

<p>Authorities seized assets from a safety deposit box in Vancouver. This shows the government&#8217;s aim to turn crime proceeds into community gains. Also, this is British Columbia&#8217;s third UWO case. It shows the region&#8217;s resolve to fight money laundering and organized crime directly.</p>

<p>As the case develops, it may set a precedent for tackling unexplained wealth. This could boost efforts to break down organized crime&#8217;s financial networks and restore integrity to digital finance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>2024 has been stellar for cryptocurrencies. Yet, such growth is often shadowed by strong corrections, a trend that may soon impact altcoins like Celestia (TIA), Kaspa (KAS), BitTensor (TAO), and Helium (HNT). Despite TAO&#8217;s impressive year-to-date (YTD) surge of over 100%, its April forecast appears bearish, signaling a potential pullback as it tries to capitalize on the hyped artificial intelligence narrative. </strong></p>



<p>Meanwhile, HNT, after a spike in February, is now finding it challenging to maintain its stride as it seeks to leverage the DePin (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) narrative. As April looms, we could see even stronger altcoin corrections for some of these tokens. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-celestia-could-go-back-to-8-5">Celestia Could Go Back To $8.5</h2>



<p>Celestia (TIA), a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/upcoming-airdrops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modular network</a> focused on providing solutions for creating blockchains, reached an all-time high (ATH) of $20.77 on February 10. Then, a strong correction followed, with the price hitting $13.8 on March 27. Although being one of the biggest synonyms of blockchain modularity, TIA didn&#8217;t follow the overall crypto surge in 2024. Its YTD growth is less than 1% this year. </p>



<p>In the last few days, EMA lines for TIA are looking bearish, with short-term lines below other lines and very close to the current price line. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="405" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TIAUSD_2024-03-27_11-36-35-850x405.png" alt="TIA 4-hour Price Chart and EMA Lines." class="wp-image-491406" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TIAUSD_2024-03-27_11-36-35-850x405.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TIAUSD_2024-03-27_11-36-35-360x171.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TIAUSD_2024-03-27_11-36-35-768x366.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TIAUSD_2024-03-27_11-36-35-1536x731.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TIAUSD_2024-03-27_11-36-35-2048x975.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TIAUSD_2024-03-27_11-36-35-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">TIA 4-hour Price Chart and EMA Lines.

<p>Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are critical tools in technical analysis, designed to smooth out price data over a specified period by placing more weight on recent prices, thus being more responsive to new information compared to Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). </p>



<p>A &#8220;death cross&#8221; occurs when a shorter-term EMA crosses below a longer-term EMA, a signal that is traditionally viewed as bearish. As happened with TIA, the short-term EMA lines have moved below its longer-term lines and are aligning closely with the current price; this setup can indicate a bearish outlook. If the downtrend continues, the TIA price could retract as down as $8.5, the price it reached on December 2023. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kaspa-is-on-the-edge">Kaspa Is on the Edge</h2>



<p>Throughout 2024, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/kaspa-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaspa (KAS)</a> experienced a 15% uptick in its valuation, showcasing a positive trajectory for the digital asset. Despite this growth, the asset faces the threat of a significant correction that could erase its yearly gains. </p>



<p>The cryptocurrency saw a sharp 41% decline over the past three weeks, descending from its peak value of $0.188 on February 20. Currently positioned as a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, Kaspa&#8217;s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at a neutral 47, indicating that it is neither overbought nor oversold.</p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-kaspa-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The downturn for KAS</a> started on March 4. Short-term EMA lines dipped below the longer-term ones, leading to falling prices until March 20. On March 26, a new death cross formed. This indicator often signals more price drops for KAS.</p>



<p>The death cross hints at more declines. KAS&#8217;s price could drop to $0.099, or even $0.075. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bittensor-tao-capitalizes-on-ai-hype-but-corrections-could-be-next">BitTensor (TAO) Capitalizes on AI Hype, but Corrections Could Be Next</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-projects-protect-against-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artificial intelligence</a> sector maintains its impressive growth trajectory this year, and BitTensor is strategically positioned to leverage this surge. Remarkably, the token witnessed a growth exceeding 110% within this year alone. Commencing the year at a value of $274, it astonishingly ascended to an all-time high of $752.13 by March 7, showcasing an <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-narratives-altcoins-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explosive growth</a> of 174.5%.</p>

<p>Subsequent to reaching this peak, however, the price of tao began to decline, stabilizing at around $580. Notably, on March 20, a technical shift was observed as TAO&#8217;s short-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) dipped below the longer-term averages, precipitating a swift decline in price from $655 to approximately $580 within just two days. </p>



<p>Although there was a brief recovery to $621, the price gravitated back toward the $580 mark, with the EMA lines continuing to suggest a looming bearish trend for TAO. Should this downward trend persist, it&#8217;s plausible that TAO might encounter significant price support levels, potentially falling to as low as $524 or even further to $415, testing critical thresholds in its market valuation.</p>

Although this is significant, HNT&#8217;s all-time high is $54.81, reached on November 12, 2021. </p>

<p>The fact that HNT didn&#8217;t come closer to its ATH, even with all the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/depin-dark-horse-crypto-bull-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hype around DePIN</a> and the overall growth of crypto in 2024, certainly raises some red flags for investors, as the coin could have lost its momentum. </p>

<p>On March 11, its short-term EMA lines crossed below the long-term lines, forming a death cross. Then, the HNT price started a free fall. It briefly recovered on March 20, but the downtrend continued, and the HNT price is currently at $6.18. If the downtrend continues, it could soon reach $4.74, and if that support isn&#8217;t strong enough, HNT could go back to December 2023 prices, testing the support at $2.17. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>PEPE supply on exchanges saw a significant drop in just one day, signaling that holders anticipate a rise in value, as an increasing Mean Coin Age suggests a lack of selling pressure and a phase of accumulation. </strong></p>



<p>Though EMA lines don’t show a strong bullish trend, they indicate potential consolidation, setting the stage for a possible price surge. Despite a 442.77% increase this year, PEPE price struggles to surpass and maintain above the $0.0000080 threshold.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pepe-supply-on-exchanges-triggered-an-important-signal">PEPE Supply On Exchanges Triggered An Important Signal</h2>



<p>Between March 25 and March 26, the PEPE supply on exchanges experienced a significant reduction, dropping from 180.7 trillion to 178.7 trillion. </p>



<p>Such a sizable decrease in supply available for trading can have a substantial impact on PEPE&#8217;s price, primarily due to the principles of supply and demand. When the supply of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/meme-coin-could-dethrone-pepe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEPE on exchanges</a> diminishes, but demand remains constant or increases, it naturally leads to upward pressure on the price. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.41-27-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="PEPE Supply on Exchanges." class="wp-image-491637" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.41-27-Mar-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.41-27-Mar-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.41-27-Mar-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.41-27-Mar-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.41-27-Mar-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.41-27-Mar-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">PEPE Supply on Exchanges. Source: <a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Historically, a precedent for this scenario occurred when a similar reduction in supply was promptly followed by a notable price surge—from $0.000008 to $0.0000106 in just one day. </p>



<p>This pattern suggests that the recent drop in exchange supply could be a precursor to another significant <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/pepe-crypto-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price increase for PEPE</a>, as reduced availability on trading platforms may prompt a spike in buying interest and price.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pepe-mean-coin-age-suggests-accumulation">PEPE Mean Coin Age Suggests Accumulation</h2>



<p>Since the beginning of March, the Mean Coin Age for PEPE has been on a consistent upward trajectory. Mean Coin Age measures the average age of all coins in a network, calculated from the time they were last moved. </p>



<p>This metric serves as an indicator of investor behavior. A growing Mean Coin Age suggests that holders are increasingly opting to hold onto their coins rather than sell them, indicating a period of accumulation. This trend is generally seen as a bullish signal for the cryptocurrency, as it implies a strong holding sentiment among investors and a potential decrease in selling pressure, which can lead to price increases.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.49-27-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="PEPE Mean Coin Age." class="wp-image-491648" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.49-27-Mar-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.49-27-Mar-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.49-27-Mar-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.49-27-Mar-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.49-27-Mar-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Pepe-PEPE-13.33.49-27-Mar-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">PEPE Mean Coin Age. Source: <a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Mean Coin Age has shown stability in the last three days, hinting that PEPE may be entering a consolidation phase. Consolidation periods often precede significant market movements as they reflect a balance between supply and demand before a new trend emerges. </p>



<p>This stabilization of Mean Coin Age, therefore, could be an early indicator that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-pepe-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEPE is gearing up</a> for the next phase of price surges, as the market consolidates and prepares for future volatility.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pepe-price-prediction-can-it-surpass-beyond-0-000011">PEPE Price Prediction: Can It Surpass Beyond $0.000011?</h2>



<p>On March 14, PEPE reached its all-time peak, hitting a remarkable price of $0.0000106. Since reaching this pinnacle, it has encountered challenges in maintaining its value above the $0.0000080 mark, showing signs of struggle in the market.</p>



<p>Currently, three out of the four Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines for PEPE are converging, aligning closely with the current price trajectory. This convergence, especially with short-term EMA lines positioned above the longer-term counterparts, sends a bullish signal to investors. This alignment suggests that the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-pepe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEPE price</a> might be stabilizing, potentially entering a phase of consolidation as market participants gauge their next moves.</p>

<p>Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) focus more on recent data, making them quicker to react than Simple Moving Averages (SMA). They give more weight to the latest prices, decreasing this weight for older data.</p>

<p>Rising supply on exchanges and Mean Coin Age for PEPE show holders want to keep their assets. They expect gains, setting PEPE up for potential price increases. If PEPE breaks the $0.0000085 level, it may reach $0.000011 for the first time. However, if it falls below $0.0000070 support, the price could dip to $0.0000049.</p>

<p><strong>Ripple (XRP) price has been in a downtrend for the better half of the month, and these bearish signals are getting stronger.</strong></p>



<p>Will the altcoin end up losing crucial support since XRP long-term holders are losing conviction in the asset?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-investors-lose-conviction">Ripple Investors Lose Conviction</h2>



<p>The long-term holders are one of the mo<a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-ripple-lawsuit-2-billion-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">st important cohorts that impact the XRP price</a>. These investors tend to hold an asset for a period of more than 12 months. Thus, selling from them is considered to be a confirmed bearish signal.</p>



<p>Their actions are observed by the total age consumed when they move their holdings between addresses. The higher the spike, the larger the amount of tokens moved. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/why-ripple-correction-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the case of Ripple</a>, their movement has not been as significant as instances in the past. Nevertheless, this is a signal that these investors are losing conviction.</p>

<p>Historically, during such occurrences, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-price-prediction-losing-support-erase-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP price has witnessed corrections</a> most of the time. The same outcome can be expected this time around as well.</p>

<p>A bearish move would be confirmed once the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falls below the neutral line at 50.0. RSI is a momentum oscillator measuring the speed and change of price movements, indicating overbought and oversold conditions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="373" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jarTtUrL-850x373.png" alt="Ripple RSI.

<p>Thus, the chances of a decline would increase if the indicators fall into the bearish zone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-price-prediction-crucial-support-lost">XRP Price Prediction: Crucial Support Lost</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-xrp-price-correction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP price is presently trading</a> above the $0.606 support level. The altcoin has already slipped below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). If the $0.606 support is invalidated, too, the cryptocurrency will lose the 100-day EMA as support.</p>



<p>This will result in further decline, potentially sending Ripple to $0.555.</p>

<p>However, per the Average Directional Index (ADX), the bearish trend has yet to gain strength. The latter is still below the 25.0 threshold crossing, which generally suggests that the active trend is gaining strength.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>As the horizon brightens with the anticipation of another altcoin season, investors are on the lookout for the next big cryptocurrency. </strong></p>



<p>With a diverse range of tokens gaining traction, the market is ripe with opportunities for those willing to dive into the depths of blockchain technology and its myriad applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-45-days-until-altcoin-season">45 Days Until Altcoin Season</h2>



<p>According to renowned analyst Rekt Fencer, altcoin season might be around the corner. This optimistic outlook suggests it is now the time to select the right low-cap cryptocurrencies, aiming for the elusive 100x returns that many dream of.</p>



<p>For this reason, it is crucial to understand the sequence of a typical bull run. Ran Neuner, a South African entrepreneur, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLWpqgMIkbY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a> that altcoin season traditionally starts with a surge in the price of Bitcoin. This is followed by Ethereum and then high-cap cryptocurrencies such as Solana and Avalanche. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;[Bitcoin is] attacking the all-time high with huge momentum. Now, the reality is that as soon as that all-time high is breached [again], and it could happen as soon as today, it is like the gun goes off for altcoins, and the race begins,&#8221; Neuner said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Neuner pointed out that becuase <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-records-new-all-time-high-what-is-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin surpassed its previous all-time high</a>,  altcoins could also reach new highs about 70 days later. It is worth noting 22 days following Bitcoin&#8217;s peak, altcoins often undergo a correction period. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="418" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-8.39.24-PM-850x418.png" alt="Bitcoin vs Altcoins Market" class="wp-image-491797" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-8.39.24-PM-850x418.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-8.39.24-PM-360x177.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-8.39.24-PM-768x378.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-8.39.24-PM-1536x755.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-8.39.24-PM-2048x1007.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-27-at-8.39.24-PM-150x74.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin vs Altcoins Market. Source: <a href="https://tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The crypto market is currently 14 days into this correction phase, and the market is beginning to recover. This pattern suggests that if the cycle continues as it has historically, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/three-altcoin-breakout-bitcoin-peaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">altcoins season could start</a> in approximately 45 days.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;To see how far [altcoins] have to go between now and hitting the all-time, that means that altcoins need to go up by 50%. Do you understand how violent a move of 50% in the next 45 days is going to be? It&#8217;s face melting,&#8221; Neuner emphasized.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, Rekt Fencer highlighted that the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/base-chain-meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-cap coins and meme coins</a> could benefit the most, albeit the higher risk. He said that achieving 2x to 10x gains is common, especially, in the early stages of altcoin season. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-cryptocurrencies-to-watch">The Cryptocurrencies to Watch</h2>



<p>To navigate altcoin season, investors are advised to build a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/must-have-crypto-portfolio-bull-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diversified crypto portfolio</a>, stick to their investment narratives, and exercise patience. </p>



<p>Rekt Fencer shared a list of six under-the-radar altcoins that may have significant potential. Leading the pack is Polyhedra Network (ZK), a project focused on Web3 interoperability, scalability, and privacy through zero-knowledge proof technology. With a market cap of $286.3 million and a current price of $3.14, Polyhedra presents an interesting entry point.</p>



<p>Not to be overlooked, the quirky meme coin Wolf Wif Ballz (BALLZ) continues to charm its way through the Solana ecosystem. With its blend of humor and investment potential, BALLZ, priced at $0.05 and boasting a $50.2 million market cap, exemplifies the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/altcoin-trader-strategy-meme-coin-mania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpredictable nature of meme coins</a>.</p>



<p>Portal (PORTAL) emerges in the GameFi space, offering a cross-chain gaming ecosystem that bridges disparate blockchain networks. Coupled with staking rewards, PORTAL, at $2.07 and a $306.6 million market cap, is crafting a new narrative for gamers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Boson Protocol (BOSON) enables the tokenization, transfer, and trade of physical goods as NFTs. BOSON, priced at $0.68 with an $83.1 million market cap, aims to revolutionize the perception of value and ownership in the digital age.</p>



<p>Finally, the market of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ai-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artificial intelligence in crypto</a> is led by pioneers such as VoluMint (VMINT) and Monai (MONAI). These projects leverage AI to enhance trading activity and integrate LLMs with blockchain protocols, respectively.</p>



<p>In preparing for the upcoming altcoin season, investors should conduct thorough research, consider diversifying their portfolios, and remain cognizant of the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. With the right strategy and a bit of patience, the next few months could be transformative for the savvy crypto investor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price is making another attempt at breaching the year-to-date high, although, by the looks of it, this may not happen.</strong></p>



<p>Multiple reasons are contributing to the bearish anticipation, but this could be turned around if BCH flips a crucial level into support.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-cash-whales-signal-drawdown">Bitcoin Cash Whales Signal Drawdown</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-lists-3-altcoins-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin Cash price will potentially bear</a> the impact of the bearishness exhibited by the whales. These large wallet investors tend to sway the direction of the price action. Historically, their selling has induced corrections, while accumulation has resulted in rallies.</p>



<p>This time around, the outcome is expected to be bearish since the addresses hodling between 1,000 to 10,000 BCH have been consistently selling since March began. Nearly 50,000 BCH worth over $25 million were sold in the last week alone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-Cash-BCH-19.16.39-27-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="Bitcoin Cash Whale Accumulation.

Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, since the price kept going upward, the altcoin is now due for a correction.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, even retail investors are going to sell their holdings now. The Market Value signals this to the Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The MVRV ratio measures investors’ profit/loss.</p>

Historically, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bch-price-recovery-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BCH corrections have occurred</a> when the indicator is between 7%-17% MVRV, labeled a danger zone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-Cash-BCH-19.16.34-27-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="Bitcoin Cash MVRV Ratio.

<p>Thus, BCH is vulnerable to corrections due to selling, which could occur at any time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bch-price-prediction-what-to-expect">BCH Price Prediction: What to Expect?</h2>



<p>If selling begins, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-cash-price-breakout-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin Cash price will likely fail</a> in testing the $501 resistance as support, even if it does manage to breach it. A decline to $448 will result in BCH losing the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).</p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-cash-hold-support-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Falling through this support will result in a drop to $400</a> or $378, which marks the confluence of the 100-day EMA.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>March was an exceptional month for the crypto market as investors witnessed Bitcoin prices hitting all-time highs as well as the rise of multiple major altcoins. However, despite the bullishness, some altcoins missed the mark.</strong></p>



<p>These altcoins will likely print new all-time highs in the coming month of April, when the second quarter of 2024 begins.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sui-will-be-the-first-to-shatter-the-record">SUI Will Be the First to Shatter the Record</h2>



<p>Sui is the altcoin in the top 100 cryptocurrencies list that is the closest to printing a new all-time high. The altcoin made an attempt last month but failed only to witness a 21% rise in the past 48 hours. This rally has brought it closer to the previous high of $2.10, witnessed back in May 2023.</p>

<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator measuring the speed and change of price movements, is also in the bullish zone. This suggests that the digital asset is not yet overbought and could cross $2.10 by the beginning of April.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aptos-apt-bull-run-continues">Aptos (APT) Bull Run Continues</h2>



<p>Aptos price rose from the low of $9 to nearly double in value as the altcoin can be seen changing hands at $18.6 at the moment. This rally will only continue as we move into Q2, given APT is less than 12.5% away from breaching the previous all-time high of $20.40 from January 2023.</p>

<p>The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a trend-following momentum indicator that is used to identify bullish and bearish trends, is also signaling growth. The indicator is continuing the bullish crossover uptrend, which will drive APT higher.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bnb-price-set-to-initiate-a-recovery">BNB Price Set to Initiate a Recovery</h2>



<p>BNB is currently on a short-term incline, inching closer to the $691 ATH. The Binance native token is about 18.14% away from the price point, which would require BNB to close above the $600 mark first.</p>

<p>Although MACD and RSI are both noting a downtick right now, they aren&#8217;t highlighting bearish trends. As long as BNB stays above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the coin will have a shot at recovery, which will likely take place in April.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-arbitrum-arb-will-need-a-push">Arbitrum (ARB) Will Need a Push</h2>



<p>Unlike other altcoins in this list, Arbitrum&#8217;s price noted its all-time high earlier this year back in January 2024. The cryptocurrency, however, noted significant correction since then, bringing the price down to $1.69.</p>

<p>The all-time high is now 42% away from the token, and ARB would need to flip the 50 and 100-day EMA in order to make it to $2. This support level will provide the boost necessary to rally on towards $2.40.</p>
