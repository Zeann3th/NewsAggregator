										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solana is experiencing robust growth amid the ongoing bull market run that has spread through the crypto industry.</strong></p>



<p>Indeed, Solana&#8217;s SOL token has emerged as one of the best performers, rising by around 30% during the past month to around $190.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solana-s-defi-soars-to-all-time-high">Solana&#8217;s DeFi Soars to All-Time High</h2>



<p>Solana&#8217;s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem has flourished with the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-new-all-time-high-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broader crypto market rally</a> since the year&#8217;s outset. Data from <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/defillama-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFiLlama</a> illustrates this trend, revealing an extraordinary surge in Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) activity. </p>



<p>Over the past 24 hours alone, daily transaction volume has surpassed an impressive $3.6 billion, establishing a new all-time high.</p>



<p>This remarkable upswing in Solana DEX transactions can be primarily attributed to two key factors. One is the network&#8217;s commendably low transaction fees, and the second is the rising <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-meme-coin-trader-million-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">popularity of meme coins</a>. Noteworthy meme coins like Wen, Dogwifhat, Bonk, and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/binance-book-of-meme-bome-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Book of Meme (BOME)</a> have recently witnessed substantial trading volumes and interest.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="850" height="322" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-149-850x322.png" alt="Solana DEX Volume" class="wp-image-484963" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-149-850x322.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-149-360x137.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-149-768x291.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-149-150x57.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-149.png 1218w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Solana DEX Volume. Source: <a href="https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/solana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DeFillama</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Interestingly, the collective impact of these factors has propelled Solana&#8217;s DEX trading volume beyond that of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum </a>on numerous occasions in recent months.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Solana is insanely congested right now and still broke a record in all-time DEX volume stoked to see what we can achieve once the network is functioning better,&#8221; Mert Mumtaz, the CEO of Helius Labs <a href="https://x.com/0xMert_/status/1768853546672193771?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chimed</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of particular interest are the top three <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-dex-jupiter-uniswap-volume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frontrunners among Solana&#8217;s DEX platforms</a>. Orca leads with $1.64 billion in trading volume over the past 24-hour period, followed by Raydium at $867 million and Lifinity at $679 million.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-tvl-surges-crypto-community-speculation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total value of assets locked on the Solana network</a> is also at a two-year high of almost $4 billion. DeFi analyst Patrick Scott pointed out an interesting fact. Solana DeFi TVL, including liquid staking, flipped the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for the first time during the past day.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;In 2023, Solana DeFi was declared dead. Since then, its TVL is up 18x. And yesterday, Solana just flipped Ethereum in daily stablecoin transfer volume. That&#8217;s quite a turnaround,&#8221; prominent crypto influencer Lark Davis <a href="https://twitter.com/thecryptolark/status/1768667989321166882?s=46&amp;t=3iAFD_WHRWDFSLixlrJyWg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the network has seen a notable increase in the creation of new Solana Public Library (SPL) tokens. Over the past week, an average of over 7,800 SPL tokens were minted daily on the Solana network. On March 11, this figure peaked at 9,690 tokens, setting a new single-day record, according to Solscan <a href="https://analytics.solscan.io/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data</a>.</p>

<p>All these milestones reflect Solana&#8217;s ascending trajectory within the DeFi ecosystem. This positions it as a formidable contender against <a href="https://beincrypto.com/defi-tvl-billion-rival-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum&#8217;s enduring sector dominance</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>El Salvador&#8217;s President Nayib Bukele reaffirmed the nation&#8217;s daily dedication to purchasing one Bitcoin. </strong></p>



<p>Bukele disclosed the transaction receipt for the day&#8217;s purchase, reflecting the country&#8217;s ongoing commitment to this initiative.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-bitcoin-a-day-proving-successful">One Bitcoin a Day Proving Successful</h2>



<p>In November 2022, Bukele announced a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) plan for El Salvador. At the time, he committed to purchasing one BTC per day as part of the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-bukele/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">country&#8217;s pro-crypto policy.</a></p>



<p>Despite facing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/el-salvador-likely-to-default-due-to-bitcoin-adoption-but-president-bukele-isnt-giving-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial criticism</a> from various international financial organizations due to the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/el-salvadors-president-urges-bitcoin-investors-to-be-patient/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bearish performance of the crypto market</a> at the time, the decision has proved to be a strategic success. The recent surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s value has resulted in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-strategy-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">significant unrealized profits for El Salvador</a>.</p>



<p>As such, President Bukele confirmed that El Salvador will continue its Bitcoin DCA strategy indefinitely. Data shows that the country has spent over $15 million to acquire 485 BTC through this approach at an average purchase price of $30,985. As of now, this stash alone is worth more than $33 million.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">

Source: <a href="https://nayibtracker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nayib Tracker</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>It is worth noting that when El Salvador&#8217;s previous purchases and Bitcoin earnings from other channels, like its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/el-salvador-foreigners-bitcoin-citizenship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">citizenship program</a>, are factored in, the total holdings amount to 5,690 BTC, valued at $387.88 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whales-continue-accumulating-btc">Whales Continue Accumulating BTC</h2>



<p>Bukele&#8217;s remarks echo the prevailing sentiment. Over the past weeks, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin whales</a> have been eager to increase their holdings. On-chain data from Santiment reveals that wallets with 10 to 10,000 BTC aggressively amassed 154,160 BTC, valued at $10.6 billion, in the last five weeks. </p>



<p>These purchases significantly contributed to Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price surge.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin&#8217;s key stakeholders have been largely responsible for the secondary wave of market cap growth over the past 5 weeks. Wallets holding between 10-10K BTC accumulated 154.16K coins (0.665% of supply) since Feb. 4th, currently worth over $10.9 billion,&#8221; Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1768334101977956729?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has revealed its intentions to introduce a USDT-margined BOME Perpetual Contract, offering leverage of up to 50x.</strong></p>



<p>BOME, known as the Book of Meme, is a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain. Its recent surge in popularity has attracted a significant number of traders, many of whom have reaped substantial profits in the past few days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-to-list-book-of-meme-bome-with-seed-tag">Binance to List Book of Meme (BOME) With Seed Tag</h2>



<p>Binance&#8217;s BOMEUSDT Perpetual Contract enables traders to leverage USDT&#8217;s stability against BOME&#8217;s <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential volatility</a>. The contract has a tick size of 0.001 and a funding rate capped between +2.00% and -2.00%.</p>



<p>Qualified liquidity providers stand to benefit from 0.005% maker fee rebates for trades within 14 to 15 days. However, Binance retains the flexibility to adjust contract specifications based on market risk conditions. More importantly, an intriguing feature of the BOMEUSDT Contract is its Multi-Assets Mode, allowing users to trade across various margin assets, including <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>.</p>



<p>In addition, Binance will enable trading for BOME across multiple spot trading pairs, including BOME/BTC, BOME/USDT, BOME/FDUSD, and BOME/TRY.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The Seed Tag&nbsp;represents an innovative project that may exhibit higher volatility and risks compared to other listed tokens.&nbsp;The Seed Tag&nbsp;will be applied to BOME,&#8221; Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-list-book-of-meme-bome-with-seed-tag-applied-bca0f355cf004367b90d7e48fee3470c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a>.</p>

<p>BOME&#8217;s listing on Binance arrives amidst the exchange <a href="https://beincrypto.com/binance-insider-trading-ronin-dump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tightening criteria for token listings</a>, aiming to bolster investor protection. New projects eyeing Binance listing face extended cliff periods, stretching from six months to a year. This entails a freeze on coin sales, increased allocations to market makers, and collateral requirements. </p>



<p>Additionally, Binance may demand a larger share of tokens to be allocated to market makers to ensure robust liquidity.</p>

Notably, it ranks among the top 10 traded assets during this period.</p>



<p>Numerous traders have capitalized on the meme coin&#8217;s momentum during this surge, yielding significant profits. Blockchain analyst Lookonchain reported that one trader earned $4.3 million in two days of BOME trading. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Grayscale amends proposal for Ethereum ETF, citing precedent of ETH futures ETFs and market surveillance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Despite the regulatory uncertainty surrounding spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), leading crypto asset management firm Grayscale&#8217;s quest for this investment product persists.</strong></p>



<p>The firm amended its proposal to uplift its Ethereum Trust into a spot Ethereum ETF that would be listed and traded on NYSE Arca.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grayscale-amends-ethereum-etf-filing">Grayscale Amends Ethereum ETF Filing</h2>



<p>Grayscale argued that since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) already approved <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-futures-etf-race-proshares-grayscale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum futures ETFs</a>, it should also sanction ETFs providing direct exposure to spot Ethereum.</p>



<p>The company asserted that the surveillance conducted by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) on the Ethereum market was sufficient to safeguard against fraud and manipulation. It further supported its argument by referencing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-coinbase-grayscale-ethereum-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase&#8217;s correlation analysis</a>, demonstrating a strong market correlation between Ethereum&#8217;s spot and futures markets.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Having approved ETH futures ETFs in part on the basis of such surveillance, the Commission has clearly determined that CME surveillance can detect spot-market fraud that would affect spot ETPs, and the Sponsor thus believes that it must also approve spot ETH ETPs on that basis,&#8221; Grayscale <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/rule-filings/filings/2024/SR-NYSEArca-2023-70_Am._1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">concluded</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p> Craig Salm, Grayscale&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, highlighted the anticipated widespread interest in a spot Ethereum ETF.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Investors want and deserve access to Ethereum in the form of a spot Ethereum ETF and we believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,&#8221; Salm <a href="https://twitter.com/CraigSalm/status/1768750794021511218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum Trust is the world&#8217;s largest investment fund, managing assets worth $11.8 billion, equivalent to 2.5% of all ETH in circulation. The planned transition to an ETF would unlock over $1.73 billion in value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-chances-of-an-approval">What Are the Chances of an Approval?</h2>



<p>Grayscale&#8217;s modified filing coincided with <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-deny-spot-ethereum-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diminishing hopes for regulatory clearance for an Ethereum ETF</a>. BeInCrypto reported earlier this week, citing Polymarket&#8217;s prediction market, that the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-etf-approval-odds-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">likelihood stood at 36%</a>. Presently, the odds have slipped further to 26%.</p>



<p>This shift can be linked to a recent <a href="https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1768399360880992423?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">communique</a> from two US senators urging the SEC to cease approval for additional crypto ETFs, citing potential risks to retail investors. They argue that cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum lack adequate trading volumes and integrity to sustain linked ETFs. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the senators cast doubt on the close correlation between futures markets for these assets and spot markets, posing challenges for market surveillance and fraud prevention.</p>



<p>Despite these dampened prospects, some industry experts remain optimistic. Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer at Bitwise, reportedly estimated a 75% chance of approval by May. On the other hand, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg&#8217;s senior ETF analyst, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1768776820466319617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opined</a> that Grayscale&#8217;s latest amendment was a &#8220;ray of light in what has seemed like a bunch of bad signs.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Recently debuted on PancakeSwap, ScapesMania garnered success in its presale and showed promising results on its first trading day. Starting strong with solid tokenomics, ScapesMania seeks to merge casual gaming and crypto, providing benefits for both gamers and token holders.</strong></p>



<p>Today, amidst another surge in the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin (BTC) is once again leading the rally with altcoins closely following suit. Analysts in the crypto sphere are forecasting an imminent altcoin season, with gaming tokens poised to take center stage. Projections from experts indicate that the gaming token niche, rapidly expanding, could potentially hit <a href="https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/gamefi-market-102420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>$90.51 billion</strong></a> by 2031.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-initial-post-listing-performance">Initial Post-Listing Performance</h2>



<p>After a highly successful presale, which garnered over <strong>$6,125,000</strong> and swiftly attracted <strong>18,400 holders</strong>, <a href="https://scapesmania.io/?utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=mmedia&amp;utm_campaign=P6J69DFGH345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ScapesMania</a> made its debut on the exchange on March 6, 2024. Now, the ecosystem&#8217;s native token, MANIA, is available for trading on PancakeSwap, a leading decentralized exchange boasting a staggering 1 million monthly users. Trading commenced with <strong>MANIA/WBNB</strong> and <strong>MANIA/USDT</strong> liquidity pairs, with USDT selected as the primary liquidity source in response to community preferences.</p>



<p>The first day of trading proved impressive. The token price has held strong.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/DN9RatK-uz9rwKaCzB8OLngf11biBRQnSq4lSh40XM3vuVOZS7tRMjUI1wZpJf_9LKLB3nL1Ioz8NAkGdmhLYQan9tRLQmr3JDo7UjDy5Y6A9uhkmHMnlpVHETek6cvO6J5a_9e0lFu3UEsf1pNvvvk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Within the first 24 hours, the number of holders stabilized at <strong>18,410</strong>, while the trading volume surged to<strong> $2.26 million</strong>. Following this, ScapesMania promptly ascended to the top of DEXTools&#8217; Hot Pairs list.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/asG7zK_7wkoC40vgD5xh98wodQTrnBXnGgyTS__tKZ-m1E66Gb7mesfx896nzLxrEfM8Uhk8PCOvF70n4jyE_MdSAiWQ-V84n1wrcwac38FKpeFUJnf-TnIzlTowlYttjIqAm7vg4uFz7rUkmlvjRYM" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-scapesmania">What is ScapesMania?</h2>



<p>In crypto gaming, there often exists a disconnect between projects and their intended audience. Crypto enthusiasts are drawn by the potential for gains, while gamers simply desire an enjoyable gaming experience without the complexities of cryptocurrency. When this divide remains unaddressed, both players and token holders tend to disengage from projects.</p>



<p><a href="https://scapesmania.io/?utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=mmedia&amp;utm_campaign=P6J69DFGH345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ScapesMania</a> tackles these challenges by venturing into the casual gaming realm. It introduces a unique system that caters to both traditional gamers and crypto enthusiasts. This means players can jump into gaming without worrying about understanding crypto intricacies, while holders can actively shape the ecosystem&#8217;s growth and reap rewards without the need to actively play.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-mania-token">What is MANIA Token?</h2>



<p>The MANIA token boasts a multitude of functionalities, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>DAO Governance:</strong> As the project progresses, it aims to transition into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governed by the community.</li>



<li><strong>Token Staking:</strong> Holders have the option to stake their MANIA tokens, thereby scoring rewards in the form of additional tokens.</li>



<li><strong>Engagement Rewards:</strong> Members can acquire tokens by engaging in a range of community activities.</li>



<li><strong>In-game Assets:</strong> Once game development is finalized, players will gain the ability to utilize MANIA tokens for acquiring in-game assets.</li>



<li><strong>In-game Rewards:</strong> Players will also have the opportunity to unlock token rewards by taking part in in-game tournaments, events, and other activities.</li>



<li><strong>Ecosystem Currency:</strong> The MANIA token is crafted for utilization across multiple projects within the ecosystem, thereby facilitating market expansion and increasing potential gains with the introduction of new games.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-makes-scapesmania-stand-out">What Makes ScapesMania Stand Out?</h2>



<p>MANIA tokenomics are meticulously balanced, featuring both a cliff and vesting. For holders, scheduled vesting means maintaining stability through keeping supply and demand in check.</p>



<p>Moreover, ScapesMania intends to motivate community members through its staking program. By locking in a specified quantity of MANIA tokens, holders can receive additional tokens as a reward for their dedication.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a quick snapshot: Among the total of <strong>4 billion</strong> MANIA tokens, a substantial <strong>320 million</strong>, or <strong>8%</strong>, are earmarked for community rewards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/BZGteMD2MTI9nVCoG-7l9s5T0C85aZvQbBiH3-MK5WNxRgrdZV3jpGv5jyiJgyQMJkdIbhw7ElLjB8aps6O2HQeBOgznj22GmK0roZaG6r0ukOrUV0WMDJ98Sg1zkVY8oypOq3zd5whh0gqTlhJh4HM" alt=""/></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Source: </em><a href="https://scapesmania.io/whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>ScapesMania’s Whitepaper</em></a></p>



<p>Through DAO governance, ScapesMania participants will have the authority to vote on pivotal decisions concerning ecosystem development.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://scapesmania.io/?utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=mmedia&amp;utm_campaign=P6J69DFGH345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ScapesMania</a> is continuously improving the utility of the $MANAI token by adding new features and incorporating it into more gaming projects. Additionally, the ScapesMania team has shown skill in reaching a wider audience, as seen in the success of the <strong>$6M+ presale</strong>. </p>



<p>With greater visibility and support from cryptocurrency influencers, the user base expands, consequently driving up demand for MANIA, which ultimately benefits both the project and the community in the long term.</p>

<p>At last, the project&#8217;s smart contract has been subjected to a thorough audit by BlockSafu. As a holder, you can rest assured that the platform places a high priority on security, safeguarding both your data and funds.</p>



<p><strong><em>P.S.</em></strong><em> Remember to conduct your </em><em>own</em><em> research (DYOR) and acknowledge the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. No specific outcomes are assured.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-community-confidence">Community Confidence</h2>



<p>Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are keen to get involved, attracted by its vision and the chance to play a meaningful role. Even whales are taking notice, as deposits have already surpassed <strong>$20,000</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ckyeRfP7cq-xg6WoslcSexHDfl7PjK5qtoaYAHkhKGji_2wtJ7lPJA2BvpWCu11p8lJto3yOfovEnz1zQ4W35MsiS_3BRvAuheUyTr8OKmXIDAKjwQAJ5LMRfDXcX00xpDr5jhKPROwJGdZQPucAEQM" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The accomplishment achieved owes much to the committed community backing it. The ScapesMania team extends sincere gratitude to its supporters for this initial momentum.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-future-opportunities">Looking Ahead: Future Opportunities</h2>



<p>Predictions from <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/app/games/casual-games/worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Statista</a> indicate that this sector is poised to exceed <strong>$19.12 billion</strong> by 2027, </p>



<p>Having met its presale goals, the team is now fully committed to product development. This phase necessitates both skill and resources, and ScapesMania is actively recruiting top talent by collaborating with seasoned game development studios and assembling an in-house team.</p>



<p>Not long ago, the CEO of ScapesMania detailed the team&#8217;s development strategy. Developers are leaving no stone unturned, meticulously crafting every step from the inception of the idea to the refinement of the final product. This entails creating hypotheses, testing them in real-world scenarios, and consistently refining them based on successful outcomes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Source: </em><a href="https://t.me/scapesmania"><em>The Official ScapesMania Telegram Community</em></a></p>



<p>Looking forward, the roadmap outlines several upcoming milestones, including the alpha release of the pilot game within the ecosystem, the initiation of a staking program, and the implementation of DAO management. According to Sven, the CEO of the project, “<em>The ScapesMania project roadmap is all about staying relevant and must be dynamic to fit the crypto market conditions.</em>”&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Unlike the rest of the market, Fetch.ai&#8217;s (FET) price prevented major losses over the last 24 hours as the altcoin kept its decline limited to 2%.</strong></p>



<p>The credit for this goes to the whales who offset the bearish cues. Nevertheless, there is still a threat to the altcoin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fetch-ai-saved-whales-for-the-win">Fetch.ai Saved &#8211; Whales for the Win</h2>



<p>The crypto market correction is weighing heavily on all the digital assets, but <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fet-investors-are-preventing-price-from-lows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fetch.ai&#8217;s price somehow did not fall as much</a>. FET only noted a 2% correction throughout the day. However, that does not cover up for the fact that the altcoin could have dropped by over 15%. All thanks to the whales for not letting this happen.</p>



<p>The intra-day lows of $2.37 were nearly locked in as trading price before the whales stepped in. The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fet-price-all-time-high-whales-selling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large wallet holders accumulated FET heavily, resulting in the price bouncing</a> back. </p>



<p>Addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million FET managed to amass over 18 million FET in two days. This is worth over $50 million, bringing their holdings to 327.81 million FET.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fetch-FET-20.32.38-15-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="Fetch.AI Whale Accumulation.

<p>Consequently, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fet-reaches-new-yearly-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fetch.ai price can be seen trading</a> at $2.80 at the time of writing.</p>

  </section>



<p>Beyond the whales, the altcoin also has solid support at the $2.26 price point. This level is the upper limit of the range in which about 394 million FET tokens worth over $1.1 billion were purchased by investors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="269" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-194458-850x269.png" alt="Fetch.AI GIOM.

<p>Thus, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fet-price-retest-next-bearish-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fetch.ai&#8217;s price will bounce back from this level</a> should it come across it, as investors will likely keep from booking profits out of fear of losses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fet-price-prediction-bearish-momentum-is-yet-to-build">FET Price Prediction: Bearish Momentum Is yet to Build</h2>



<p>Fetch.ai&#8217;s price nearly slipped to $2.37 but bounced back to the trading price of $2.80. This establishes the precedent that the bullish steam has not been completely exhausted. The altcoin is still above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, which is also a positive signal, making <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fetch-ai-attracts-whale-demand-price-bounce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FET safe from falling below</a> the $2.46 support floor.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Parabolic SAR, a trend-following indicator that helps traders identify potential reversals in price direction, indicates a downtrend. While the black dots are present above the candlestick, it is not intensive yet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="391" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FrUp7slr-850x391.png" alt="FET/USDT 1-day chart.

<p>Additionally, the Average Directional Index (ADX) is also above the 25.0 threshold. ADX is used to assess the strength of the momentum, and the downtrend is losing strength presently as the indicator is noting a downtick.</p>

<p>But, this does not rule out the potential of this trend gaining strength down the line, which could pull Fetch.aiI price down to $2.46. Losing this support line would invalidate the bullish thesis, sending FET to $2.26 or beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faces a potential 50-year prison sentence. </strong></p>



<p>Convicted in November for orchestrating what prosecutors have termed one of the &#8220;biggest financial frauds in American history,&#8221; Bankman-Fried&#8217;s downfall is a tale of ambition gone awry, set against the backdrop of the cryptocurrency boom.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-bankman-fried-faces-up-to-50-years-in-prison">Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Up to 50 Years in Prison</h2>



<p>The crux of the prosecution&#8217;s argument hinges on Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s fraudulent activities, which led to the spectacular collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The jury in a Manhattan federal court found him guilty on all charges, including defrauding investors, customers, and lenders. Thereby, unsettling the once booming crypto market.</p>



<p>Prosecutors have painted a damning portrait of Bankman-Fried, describing his recent life as marred by &#8220;unmatched greed and hubris.&#8221; They argue that his actions were risky and a deliberate ploy to gamble with billions of dollars of other people. </p>



<p>Despite the gravity of his actions, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/sam-bankman-fried-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> has refrained from admitting wrongdoing. This is a stance that has only compounded the case against him.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Even now, Bankman-Fried refuses to admit what he did was wrong. His life in recent years has been one of unmatched greed and hubris; of ambition and rationalization; and courting risk and gambling repeatedly with other people&#8217;s money,&#8221; prosecutors wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In contrast, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sam-bankman-fried-dodge-century-prison-sentence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense argues for leniency</a>, suggesting a prison term of just over five to six years. They contend that most <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ftx-to-sell-anthropic-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX clients will recover their lost funds</a> and that Bankman-Fried did not intentionally set out to commit fraud. </p>



<p>This defense, however, seems to falter against the weight of evidence presented during the trial. These include testimony from several of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s closest associates who have since turned state&#8217;s witnesses.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The impending sentencing on March 28 will conclude this chapter of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s life and set a precedent for regulating and overseeing the cryptocurrency industry. US Attorney Damian Williams emphasized the age-old nature of corruption revealed by this case, reflecting that while the players and platform might be new, the deceit practiced is a tale as old as time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. The cryptocurrency industry might be new. The players, like Sam Bankman-Fried, might be new. But this kind of corruption is as old as time,&#8221; attorney Williams said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Crafting a compelling pitch for a crypto project is essential in capturing the attention of venture capitalists (VCs), who sift through hundreds of proposals weekly. </strong></p>



<p>Still, invaluable insights can be learned into what VCs look for in crypto startups. These include outlining a blueprint for entrepreneurs to refine their approach, focusing on timing, clarity, market understanding, team composition, and community engagement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-the-perfect-pitch">Building the Perfect Pitch</h2>



<p>Danilo Carlucci, Founder and CEO of Morningstar Ventures, told BeInCrypto that timing is critical. Startups should engage VCs only when they have a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates their product&#8217;s or service&#8217;s feasibility and potential. This stage is crucial for eliciting initial interest and feedback from investors. </p>



<p>Then, utilizing this feedback to refine the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allows startups to showcase tangible achievements and metrics, making a stronger case for investment. According to Carlucci, proper timing and iteration of these stages, evidenced by quantifiable success metrics, significantly impact the project&#8217;s Future Diluted Valuation (FDV).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Timing is such a difficult thing to get perfect. But if start-ups time their project stages correctly and iterate them, they can raise more funds, ultimately impacting their FDV,&#8221; Carlucci said. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also emphasized the importance of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/web3-interview-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarity and conciseness in pitches</a>. A successful pitch concisely articulates the problem being solved, the uniqueness of the solution, and the strategic use of capital.

<p>Projects that distinguish themselves through a well-defined unique selling proposition (USP), backed by thorough market and competitor analysis, stand out. Incorporating on-chain metrics and market trends can further enhance a project&#8217;s attractiveness by providing a clear picture of its potential.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;We’ve all heard it before. Less is more. As simple as it sounds, we value clear and concise pitches. Keep it short and sweet! Not only do VCs read through hundreds of pitches a week, but I firmly believe that the less time it takes to explain your project, the better it will be,&#8221; Carlucci advice. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Likewise, Samuel Huber, the CEO of Landvault and the Matera Protocol, told BeInCrypto that startups should pivot their focus toward hard metrics. These include profitability, burn rate, and capital efficiency, which are now paramount to investors. Even with the current enthusiasm in the crypto market, the broader economy will likely continue to adopt a cautious approach.</p>



<p>The emphasis on real revenue generation cannot be overstated. In the flux of market cycles, where <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/must-have-crypto-portfolio-bull-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bull markets</a> often prioritize growth at the expense of solid business foundations, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-ways-to-make-money-in-a-crypto-bear-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bear markets</a> shift the focus back to fundamental metrics like revenue.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Entrepreneurs should shift their focus towards metrics that investors prioritize. Indeed, crypto startups need to demonstrate their ability to generate real revenue. They must focus on showcasing practical business models rather than solely emphasizing decentralization,&#8221; Huber explained. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>The path to funding is fraught with challenges. &#8220;There&#8217;s a tightening of funds for startups with unproven business models and poor execution,&#8221; Huber noted. He emphasized the importance of demonstrating tangible business metrics over mere projections. This calls for a meticulous focus on building a solid business that stands out in a bear market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tokenomics-and-the-dream-team">Tokenomics and the Dream Team</h2>



<p>Moreover, the team behind a project is a critical factor for VCs. Carlucci emphasized that VCs invest in people as much as in ideas. Therefore, a team&#8217;s track record, complementarity, and vision are scrutinized. The team&#8217;s openness to collaboration and feedback and a proactive approach significantly influence a VC&#8217;s investment decision. </p>



<p>In this regard, most VCs look for teams with a strong track record and extensive experience in their field.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The team is everything! No matter the tech, the design, or the idea, most VCs invest in people; therefore, the team and the vision of the founder is crucial,&#8221; Carlucci said. </p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/tokenomics-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokenomics</a> and crypto narrative trends play a crucial role in attracting investment. Projects must design tokenomics that align VCs&#8217; interests with the project&#8217;s long-term vision, ensuring a vested interest in the project&#8217;s success. Likewise, entrepreneurs must align their projects with prevailing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-narratives-altcoins-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto narratives</a>, striving to position themselves as leaders within these spaces. </p>



<p>Despite the inherent risks in the crypto industry, Carlucci suggested that a well-articulated USP and comprehensive market analysis can address potential concerns and demonstrate the startup&#8217;s awareness of and preparedness for challenges. Meanwhile, Huber highlighted the importance of utility and adaptability. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Generally, projects within infrastructure sectors are highly attractive to investors due to their potential for broader utility. While applications certainly create value, infrastructure projects influenced by narrative trends such as NFTs, the metaverse, DeFi, RWA, or the creator economy offer a foundation that can be leveraged by others, thereby enhancing their resilience,&#8221; Huber added.</p>
</blockquote>

Source: <a href="https://www.thetie.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The TIE</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Trust is also a critical factor in investment decisions. VCs prefer to back founders they know and trust, reflecting the importance of building a strong company and networking to enhance credibility. In Huber&#8217;s view, the journey to securing VC funding in the crypto market is as much about showcasing resilience and innovation as it is about navigating the nuances of investor expectations and market dynamics.</p>



<p>Indeed, Carlucci highlighted the importance of selecting the right VC partners. Startups should seek strategic partners offering more than capital, such as user access, networking opportunities, and industry expertise. </p>

<p>By focusing on timing, clarity, team dynamics, tokenomics, and strategic partnerships, startups can increase their chances of attracting the necessary funding to propel their projects forward. Adhering to these principles is instrumental to securing venture capital funding in the crypto market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Book of Meme (BOME) token, created by the artist behind Pepe, Darkfarms, has surged 20 times in three hours. This remarkable increase has propelled the crypto asset&#8217;s market value to $1.24 billion.</strong></p>



<p>The pre-sale for the Book of Meme altcoin began on March 13, allowing participants to send an unspecified amount of Solana (SOL) to a designated address.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solana-meme-coin-skyrockets">Solana Meme Coin Skyrockets</h2>



<p>BOME quickly gained traction within the Sino-British community. The pre-sale garnered an unexpected 10,131 SOL, far surpassing Darkfarms&#8217;s 500 to 600 SOL expectations. The overwhelming response led to a subsequent community vote on allocating pre-sale funds.</p>



<p>Following the pre-sale, Darkfarms integrated the raised funds into a liquidity pool, setting BOME&#8217;s initial price of $0.0000496. Large purchase orders of 100 SOL created a highly liquid market that led to a price peak of $0.0012. This surge later increased the token&#8217;s market capitalization to $1.24 billion.</p>



<p>Following BOME&#8217;s rise, several exchanges, including BitMart and HTX, said they would list the asset. Bitmart later confirmed the primary listing of the altcoin with an initial USDT trading pair.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;BitMart is thrilled to announce the primary listing&nbsp;of&nbsp;Book of Meme (BOME)&nbsp;on March 14th, 2024&#8230;Deposit feature: Available&#8230; Trading Pair:&nbsp;BOME/USDT,&#8221; BitMart <a href="https://support.bitmart.com/hc/en-us/articles/23810086172827--Primary-Listing-BitMart-Will-List-BOOK-OF-MEME-BOME" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>Book of Meme comprises an updateable electronic magazine, a meme creation tool, and a comprehensive meme library with non-mint JPEGs. Built on Solana by the artist behind the Pepe meme coin, the project uses Arweave, IPFS, and inscriptions for data storage and doubles as a social platform for cross-chain storage. Its later plans include using a single NFT to link all stored content related to a particular meme. </p>



<p>BOME&#8217;s surge coincides with a broader uptick in the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/memecoin-sector-crypto-market-cap-moves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coin sector</a> that reached a market cap of $40 billion recently. Earlier this year, Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and Dogwifhat (WIF) were at the forefront, with the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/meme-coin-skyrocket-buy-sell-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WIF soaring 45%</a> and setting a new all-time high of $3.45.</p>

<p>However, the recent increase in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-defi-network-activity-increasing-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana network activity</a> has also attracted malicious actors. Security firm BlockAid reported crypto scams two months ago targeting Solana users through <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-wallet-drainers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wallet drainer attacks</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>the Ripple (XRP) price follows the path of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. This is not a good sign for the investors.</strong></p>



<p>Their situation is close to worsening, and should Ripple lose this crucial support; all the profits noted this month would be erased.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-holders-in-peril">Ripple Holders in Peril</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-xrp-price-correction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP price has been falling</a> for the past three days as the whole crypto market has been correcting. Due to the influence of Bitcoin, the altcoin is charting red candlesticks on the daily chart, falling through major support levels.</p>



<p>Already, nearly <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-400-million-xrp-transaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">80% of all gains from the month of March have been lost</a> owing to the decline, bringing the altcoin to trade at $0.625. This drawdown, in addition to the investors, has also affected leverage traders.</p>



<p>Long contracts pining for an increase in XRP price have been losing money as liquidations have dominated the market. In the past 24 hours, over $4.47 million worth of long liquidations have been recorded.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="242" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-850x242.png" alt="Ripple Liquidations" class="wp-image-484636" style="aspect-ratio:3.512396694214876;width:952px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-850x242.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-360x102.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-768x219.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-1536x437.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-150x43.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704.png 1722w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ripple Liquidations.

<p>This will discourage traders from betting on price increases, which would circumvent any possibility of the altcoin attempting a revival again.</p>



<p>Furthermore, technical indicators are also signaling a bearish outcome at the moment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already fallen below the neutral line of 50.0 into the bearish zone. RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in a security.</p>

<p>Secondly, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also on the verge of noting a bearish crossover. MACD, a momentum indicator, tracks the correlation between two moving averages of a security&#8217;s price, aiding in trend identification.</p>

<p>Combining the two makes it evident that the likely outcome for XRP will be bearish.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-price-prediction-more-losses-on-the-way">XRP Price Prediction: More Losses on the Way</h2>



<p>XRP price is trading at $0.612, dropping by 8.5% in the past 24 hours. As the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-brad-garlinghouse-xrp-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aforementioned instances make it clear</a> that the altcoin will likely see more decline, it could see a fall to $0.606 and beyond.</p>



<p>This would result in the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-price-long-term-support-level-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple token losing the crucial 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement</a> support level and wiping out more than 90% of March&#8217;s gains. As is, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has been lost as a support. If XRP falls through the 100-day EMA as well, erasing the entire profits noted in the last two weeks.</p>

<p>But while the market signals a decline, whales attempt to minimize these losses by accumulating XRP. In the last 48 hours, addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have added more than 50 million XRP worth over $30 million.</p>

If the 50-day EMA is managed to be reclaimed as support, the bearish thesis would be invalidated.</p>
