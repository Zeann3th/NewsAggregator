										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The US Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has broadened its sanctions, targeting individuals and entities within Russia&#8217;s financial and technology sectors. </strong></p>



<p>This action impacts <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thirteen entities and two individuals</a>. They are involved with virtual assets that could bypass US sanctions. Notably, five of these entities are linked to individuals previously sanctioned by OFAC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-treasury-targets-firms-aiding-russian-sanctions-evasion">Treasury Targets Firms Aiding Russian Sanctions Evasion</h2>



<p>These steps build on OFAC&#8217;s efforts from February 23, 2024. The aim is to cut off Russia&#8217;s access to vital financial infrastructure, thereby hindering its military actions against Ukraine. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E. Nelson pointed out Russia&#8217;s shift towards <a href="https://beincrypto.com/russia-cbdc-topple-dollar-dominance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative payment methods</a>. </p>



<p>These methods help Russia avoid US sanctions and continue its conflict with Ukraine. Nelson stressed that the Treasury would keep identifying and countering firms that assist sanctioned Russian financial bodies in reconnecting with the global financial system.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“As the Kremlin seeks to leverage entities in the financial technology space, Treasury will continue to expose and disrupt the companies that seek to help sanctioned Russian financial institutions reconnect to the global financial system.” Nelson Stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As a consequence, authorities have frozen all US assets and property interests of the designated individuals and entities. Reporting to OFAC is mandatory for them. Additionally, entities that the sanctioned parties own at least 50% of are also subject to these restrictions. OFAC&#8217;s regulations generally forbid any transactions by US persons that involve property or interests of the designated parties, barring specific exemptions. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-russia-considers-crypto-regulation-amid-growing-sanctions-pressure">Russia Considers Crypto Regulation Amid Growing Sanctions Pressure</h2>



<p>Meanwhile, in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-treasury-sanctions-9b-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russia</a>, the dialogue around using cryptocurrencies for transactions is gaining momentum. Finance Minister Siluanov&#8217;s recent remarks emphasize a balanced approach to the crypto market, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/russian-finance-minister-crypto-not-prohibited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favoring regulation over prohibition</a>. This perspective suggests a strategic recalibration in Russia&#8217;s stance towards digital currencies amid increasing sanctions.</p>



<p>In a related development, CommEx, a prominent crypto exchange seen as <a href="https://beincrypto.com/russian-crypto-exchange-commex-closes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russia&#8217;s counterpart to Binance, is closing down</a>. This announcement follows the exchange&#8217;s takeover of Binance&#8217;s operations in Russia, a move shrouded in secrecy. CommEx has initiated a phased shutdown, significantly affecting Russia&#8217;s cryptocurrency community and signaling uncertain times ahead for the nation&#8217;s crypto market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Litecoin (LTC) price rose 11% in three days, but is there more room for growth? Technical indicators suggest so. The coin&#8217;s RSI remains healthy, indicating there&#8217;s still room for bulls to push prices higher.</strong></p>



<p>The number of short-term traders holding LTC has been steadily increasing, which could lead to more price volatility in the future. These short-term traders are known to jump in and out of positions quickly, which can cause prices to swing wildly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-litecoin-rsi-is-still-healthy-despite-the-recent-price-growth">Litecoin RSI Is Still Healthy Despite the Recent Price Growth</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/litecoin-vs-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Litecoin</a> RSI has exhibited a notable uptick in the last two weeks, climbing from 60 to its current level of 67. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) serves as a valuable tool for gauging an asset&#8217;s relative strength and pinpointing potential turning points. </p>



<p>The RSI reflects the overall momentum behind price movements by comparing the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses. This indicator ranges from 0 to 100, with readings above 70 generally considered indicative of overbought conditions, potentially foreshadowing a price correction. Conversely, values below 30 suggest an oversold asset that might be primed for a rebound.</p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-litecoin-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This recent rise in LTC</a> RSI shows a surge in buying pressure, highlighting heightened investor interest and a more active market. While the current reading of 67 falls within a healthy zone, it&#8217;s important to note that it&#8217;s edging closer to the overbought territory. </p>

<p>This suggests that a period of consolidation or even a potential pullback could be on the horizon as some investors choose to take profits. However, it&#8217;s still too early to definitively predict a reversal, and the RSI itself doesn&#8217;t provide a guaranteed roadmap for future price movements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-traders-are-still-growing">Traders Are Still Growing</h2>



<p>A deeper dive into LTC holder trends reveals a constant rise in short-term holders. These Traders, holding LTC for less than a month, grew from 429k to 529k between February 18 and March 25. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="850" height="256" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-12.50.54-850x256.png" alt="LTC Addresses by Time Held." class="wp-image-489894" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-12.50.54-850x256.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-12.50.54-360x109.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-12.50.54-768x232.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-12.50.54-1536x463.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-12.50.54-2048x618.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-12.50.54-150x45.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">LTC Addresses by Time Held.

<p>However, this surge in short-term ownership comes with a potential downside. Mid-term holders, or &#8220;cruisers&#8221; as they&#8217;re known (those holding for more than a month and less than a year), are showing signs of retreat. This demographic decreased from 2.74M to 2.54M in that same period. </p>



<p>This shift towards short-term traders and away from long-term believers could have a two-pronged impact on <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/litecoin-payment-stores/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LTC price</a>. Increased volatility is a likely consequence. Short-term traders are known for their rapid buying and selling, which can trigger price swings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ltc-price-prediction-ema-lines-just-formed-a-golden-cross">LTC Price Prediction: EMA Lines Just Formed a Golden Cross</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/litecoin-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LTC recent price surge</a> could be just the beginning. The short-term EMA lines recently crossed above the long-term EMA lines. This is known as a golden cross. This is a bullish configuration, stating that a new bull run could start soon. </p>



<p>Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are technical analysis indicators used to understand price trends and potential turning points in an asset&#8217;s value. Unlike a Simple Moving Average (SMA) that assigns equal weight to all prices within a given timeframe, EMAs place greater emphasis on recent price points. This weighting system allows EMAs to react more swiftly to market changes and identify trends with greater accuracy. </p>

<p>A bullish crossover occurs when a short-term EMA rises above a long-term EMA, while a bearish crossover is the opposite. </p>

If that happens, LTC could keep rising and achieve $115 by next week. This would mark LTC&#8217;s highest price since April 2022. However, a breakdown of established support levels at $83 could <a href="https://beincrypto.com/litecoin-price-prediction-correction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trigger a further dip toward $72</a>. </p>

<p><strong>The Solana memecoin world is buzzing yet again. This time around, with the debut of the <a href="https://jizzlordcoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JizzLord</a> token (JIZLRD) and its significant liquidity pool (LP). </strong></p>



<p> JIZLRD’s LP event follows the memecoin’s highly successful pre-sale, which closed on March 20. The pre-sale exceeded its initial goal by garnering 1301 SOL. </p>



<p>Since the token’s official debut – which has been live for just over a day – JIZLRD has demonstrated remarkable market performance.</p>



<p>Within just 35 hours of going live, the token achieved an impressive trading volume of $1.2 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-breakdown-of-jizlrd-s-surge"><strong>A Breakdown of JIZLRD’s Surge </strong></h2>



<p>$JIZLRD’s breakdown of transactions reveals a buy-to-sell ratio of 72%, with 1542 purchases against 605 sales, underscoring confidence and positive sentiment among investors involved.</p>



<p>The trading volume within the first 24 hours alone hit over $1 million, with the price of JIZLRD rapidly expanding from 0.0008766 SOL to reaching its current peak of 0.002492 SOL, thus doubling in growth. </p>



<p>What’s more, the amount of holders has boosted to 1,700, overriding the number of transactions owing to strategic airdrops, which are garnering significant hype and are poised to continue to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To further enhance the token’s appeal and value, the JizzLord team —notably consisting of software engineers from JP Morgan — is burning 50 million tokens, lowering its circulating supply to 900 million for exclusivity.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jizzlord-s-strategic-steps-nbsp"><strong>JizzLord’s Strategic Steps&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>As the project continues to progress, it’s on a mission to capture the hearts of crypto <a href="https://twitter.com/jizzlordcoin">Twitter</a> users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly to Portal’s ‘Crystal Dash’ airdrop — which offered $PORTAL to those who tweeted about the project and now boasts a fully diluted market cap of $1.98 billion — it’s urging followers to tag and retweet about JIZLRD.</p>



<p>As an act of goodwill, the person with the most popular post is to receive a whopping $1,000 in JIZLRD tokens in return. </p>



<p>Additionally, the memecoin has taken a significant step forward by making its LP accessible on Dextools. As investors connect their wallets on the DeFi trading app, they can seamlessly become part of a promising venture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Efforts to enhance the token’s accessibility beyond Dextools will include listing on numerous exchanges to broaden its investor base. Parallel to this, a diplomatic push toward paid marketing will help capture a broader audience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also aims to advance innovation and growth with its new roadmap, loyalty NFTs as rewards, and a daily raffle that opens prizes, strengthening the community and enhancing users’ experiences.&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price has seen a sharp decline, highlighted by a 60% fall in average transaction size in just four days. This substantial decrease could indicate fading investor interest in Shiba Inu, possibly signaling a change in the previously bullish market sentiment.</strong></p>



<p>The SHIB RSI remaining in the overbought zone suggests that further price corrections could be on the horizon. Additionally, the consolidation pattern formed by the EMA lines indicates that SHIB&#8217;s price may stabilize at current levels, hinting at a potentially difficult period ahead for maintaining its recent upward momentum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shiba-inu-transaction-average-size-is-still-declining-heavily">Shiba Inu Transaction Average Size Is Still Declining Heavily</h2>



<p>Reviewing the average transaction size of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/shiba-inu-shib-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SHIB</a> over the past month reveals a fascinating pattern. From February 21 to March 11, it surged from $10,139 to $49,816, marking a 391% increase in just about three weeks. </p>



<p>During this timeframe, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/shiba-inu-explainer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SHIB price</a> also rose from $0.000009 to $0.000033, achieving a 266% growth. This recent bullish phase shows a clear correlation between these metrics.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the average transaction size experienced further growth before undergoing a significant decline. Specifically, it dropped from $49,816 on March 11 to $9,352 on March 24, an 81.23% decrease. Particularly in the last four days, the average transaction size for SHIB declined by 60%. </p>



<p>Given the apparent correlation between these two metrics in recent months, the substantial gap between the drop in average transaction size and the price correction suggests that SHIB prices may face further declines in the coming days.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-metric-indicates-the-shib-price-may-be-overheated">This Metric Indicates the SHIB Price May Be Overheated</h2>



<p>SHIB might be due for a reality check, even after the recent price drop. The sky-high RSI of 81 is flashing a caution sign. With a reading that far above the 70 mark, SHIB might be a bit overheated right now. This could prime the pump for a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/shiba-inu-platforms-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SHIB price pullback</a>.</p>



<p>Think of RSI as a gauge for a buying frenzy. When it rockets past 70, it suggests the asset might be due for a correction as the market seeks equilibrium between buyers and sellers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-11.02.47-25-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="SHIB RSI 7D." class="wp-image-489838" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-11.02.47-25-Mar-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-11.02.47-25-Mar-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-11.02.47-25-Mar-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-11.02.47-25-Mar-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-11.02.47-25-Mar-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBA-INU-SHIB-11.02.47-25-Mar-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SHIB RSI 7D.

<p>The RSI, a technical analysis darling, oscillates between 0 and 100, reflecting the momentum and rate of price swings based on recent highs and lows. SHIB RSI might have cooled down a tad from 88 on March 11 to 83 by March 25, but it&#8217;s still undeniably in overbought territory.</p>



<p>Traditionally, investors see this as a bearish signal. It suggests the asset has been on a buying spree that might not be sustainable. So, the expectation is for a potential price drop as the market naturally adjusts to this situation, bringing SHIB closer to its true value.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shib-price-prediction-more-consolidation-ahead">SHIB Price Prediction: More Consolidation Ahead?</h2>



<p>SHIB exhibits a potentially bearish technical indicator based on its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/moving-averages-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)</a>. The short-term EMAs are approaching a crossover below the long-term EMAs. This technical analysis suggests a possible decline in price if the current trend persists. </p>



<p>However, the current market sentiment surrounding SHIB remains unclear. The close proximity of all EMA lines to the current price indicates a period of consolidation. During consolidation, the price of SHIB has the potential to break out in either direction depending on future market developments and overall sentiment.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that EMAs are weighted averages that place greater emphasis on recent price movements. This characteristic allows them to react more swiftly to market changes compared to Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). </p>



<p>EMAs serve as valuable tools for identifying trends and potential price reversals. A <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bearish outlook</a> is associated with a downward crossover (short-term EMA falls below long-term EMA), while the converse is true for a bullish signal.</p>

<p>Given this scenario, the SHIB price should stay in the $0.000023 to $0.000028 range. However, if a strong downtrend occurs and the $0.000023 support isn&#8217;t enough, it could retest old support at $0.000009. On the other hand, a new bull run could test $0.000045 again.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Optimism (OP) price noted a 10% rally in the past 24 hours, and on a technical level, it is poised for further rally.</strong></p>



<p>However, considering the broader market cues, OP might end up correcting by 15%. Here is why.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-optimism-faces-bearish-pressure">Optimism Faces Bearish Pressure</h2>



<p><a href="https://Optimism vs. Arbitrum: Ethereum Layer-2 Rollups Compared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Optimism price, trading at $3.78 at the time of writing</a>, is reeling from a 10.81% rally observed in the last 24 hours. In the short-term timeframe, this marked considerable profits for investors, preparing for further rise, which likely may not come.</p>



<p>The reason is that the recent rally intensified the selling pressure as profits surged. This can be noted in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The 7-day MVRV ratio gauges investors&#8217; profit/loss on assets bought in the last week.</p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-l2-fees-dencun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Optimism&#8217;s MVRV at 10.16% suggests</a> recent buyers&#8217; profits are up 10.16%, likely to sell, signaling a potential downturn. MVRV between 3% and 9% signifies a danger zone for OP, hinting at potential corrections.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Optimism-OP-19.41.33-25-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="Optimism MVRV ratio.

<p>Furthermore, a major resistance in the path of a rally is the 95 million OP that investors bought. This supply was purchased within the $3.87 and $4.85 range, amounting to $361 million. </p>

<p> <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-l2-fees-dencun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Optimism price might find difficulty</a> in turning this entire supply profitable owing to the potential of selling at the hands of investors. This would result in corrections as OP would fail to breach the key $4 resistance level.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-op-price-prediction-what-if-not-a-20-rally">OP Price Prediction: What if Not a 20% Rally?</h2>



<p>Optimism price will likely fall back to $3.40 if the aforementioned conditions end up being true. The market would subsequently cool down, and if the broader <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-l2-fees-dencun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bearish cues weight upon OP</a>, the altcoin could end up declining to $3.20.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="373" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/V87jz3dg-850x373.png" alt="OP/USDT 1-day chart.

<p>However, the Golden Cross being observed on the 4-hour chart is the first in nearly two months. The golden cross occurs in when the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crosses above a 200-day EMA, indicating a potential bullish trend reversal in the market.</p>

<p>The last time this occurred, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-l2-fees-dencun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Optimism&#8217;s price ended up rallying</a> by nearly 20%. A similar rise this time around would send OP to $4.50, invalidating the bearish thesis and flipping $4 into support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>On March 25, news surfaced on the internet about Nilam Resources, a South American gold mining stalwart, announcing a strategic shift towards Bitcoin. It detailed an ambitious acquisition of MindWave, which holds a staggering 24,800 BTC, among other assets.</strong></p>



<p>However, Bitcoin analyst Tuur Demeester <a href="https://x.com/TuurDemeester/status/1772363440729800984?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">condemned</a> the news as a &#8220;stunt from a dying penny stock.&#8221; Likewise, broadcaster and filmmaker Max Keiser <a href="https://x.com/maxkeiser/status/1772372874323485174?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> the news looked like a &#8220;pump and dump.&#8221;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/03/25/2851986/0/en/Nilam-Resources-Enters-Letters-of-Intent-to-Acquire-24-800-Bitcoin.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deal</a> was supposed to mark a billion-dollar leap into cryptocurrencies involving Nilam Resources issuing a newly authorized Preferred Class of Series C Stock. These were to be exchanged for the 24,800 BTC at a rate discounted from the current market prices. </p>



<p>Nonetheless, the news has been debunked by several key industry leaders, and some news outlets have decided to pull it off. This latest &#8220;stunt&#8221; reflects the need for due diligence in a market ripped with speculation.  </p>

<p><strong>Australian digital wallet provider and payment startup <a href="https://stables.money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stables </a>has today announced the launch of international remittances for its thousands of users (focusing on the AU-PH Corridor). </strong></p>



<p>From today, <a href="https://stables.money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Stables </strong></a>users in over 130 countries can send Australian Dollars or Philippine Pesos to over 140 million people across Australia and the Philippines, all powered by stablecoins. </p>



<p>As the largest importer of remittances within Southeast Asia, the Philippines has inflows in excess of $40 billion per year (with $5.76 billion from Australia alone). In recent years, the Philippines has increasingly adopted digital forms of payment due to 44% of the population aged 15 and over in the Philippines estimated to be unbanked, leading to increased acceptance of digital wallets and e-wallets like Gcash in the region.</p>



<p>With the market capitalisation of stablecoins hitting new highs in March 2024, totalling over US $140 billion, there is strong momentum this year for the cohort-leading venture. <a href="https://stables.money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Stables </strong></a>and its Founders have an unwavering belief in stablecoins to offer users speed, low-cost settlement, security and reliability for its users. </p>



<p>On the recent announcement, Stables Co-Founder and CEO Erez Rachamim said, “This is the first time in Australian history that a company has embedded stablecoins in remittance rails with both domestic jurisdictions covered to deliver a payload with no middlemen, intra-day with sub 1% fees, we cannot wait to bring feature parity to the Philippines by May 2024,” Rachamim continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Our vision at Stables has always been to simplify the usage of stablecoins and drive their widespread adoption globally to improve access to basic financial services in emerging markets where a significant portion of the population is underbanked,&#8221; said Erez Rachamim, CEO of Stables.</p>



<p>“Initially, Stables set out to reimagine how stablecoins could power everyday payments, and today, we’ve turned that into a reality. Our users can now send Philippines Pesos or Australian Dollars from their stablecoin balance directly into any local bank account or eWallet, without the need for the other party to have a Stables wallet or know that the funds started as a digital asset on the blockchain,” he continued.</p>



<p>“Stablecoin remittances are a lifeline for many who need to send money to their loved ones, as they provide faster, cheaper and more transparent transactions than traditional methods. Stablecoins are challenging the status quo of remittance services. We believe they will shape the future of cross-border payments, and the little guys will keep more money in their pockets,” says Rachamim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stables has forged strong relationships and partnerships with major global payment players like Mastercard in 2023, announcing the launch of the Stables Mastercard<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> virtual prepaid card in Australia. This groundbreaking solution allowed users to seamlessly and securely spend their stablecoin balance anywhere Mastercard cards are accepted, in-store or online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leveraging Circle Internet Financial (Circle)’s USDC, the Stables virtual card empowers customers to utilize their stablecoins in the physical world, meeting the growing demand for real-world spending among digital asset holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founded in February 2021, Stables is on a mission to empower people to access the global financial system through transparent and fair stablecoin products. Stablecoin remittances offer cheaper alternatives but still face challenges to adoption. Stables hopes to bridge that gap as it aggressively moves into new international markets in 2024.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The dwindling supply of FTM among traders over the last few days signals a noticeable shift towards accumulation by mid-term and long-term holders, suggesting a strengthened belief in FTM&#8217;s future prospects. </strong></p>



<p>The FTM price is buoyed by positive market sentiment, with its 7-day RSI indicating high investor interest despite being in the overbought zone. The bullish trend suggested by the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) lines hints at FTM potentially reaching a 2-year high in the near future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rsi-is-at-overbought-levels">RSI Is at Overbought Levels</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/fantom-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTM</a> 7-day RSI, a key indicator of whether an asset is overbought or oversold, currently stands at 77, showing a slight decrease from last week&#8217;s 81. </p>



<p>This metric, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or asset. Values above 70 typically indicate an asset is overbought and may be due for a price correction. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-09.20.46-25-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="FTM RSI 7D." class="wp-image-489727" style="aspect-ratio:2.951388888888889;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-09.20.46-25-Mar-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-09.20.46-25-Mar-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-09.20.46-25-Mar-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-09.20.46-25-Mar-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-09.20.46-25-Mar-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fantom-FTM-09.20.46-25-Mar-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">FTM RSI 7D. Source: <a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>However, it&#8217;s worth noting that, in the past, FTM price has continued to grow for weeks even when the RSI suggested overbought conditions. This demonstrates that while the RSI can signal potential reversals, it does not guarantee them, and market dynamics can sustain price growth beyond traditional technical expectations.</p>



<p>Even with the overbought status, the buyer&#8217;s interest can continue growing. Since <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-add-fantom-metamask/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTM price</a> is also affected by other variables, like the overall sentiment around the crypto market, it could continue growing despite its RSI 7D above 70. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ftm-supply-is-changing-hands">FTM Supply Is Changing Hands</h2>



<p>An analysis of FTM token movement between February 24 and March 23 reveals a dynamic shift in investor behavior. This period witnessed a surge in FTM held by Traders, defined as those with a holding period of less than a month. The FTM balance in their hands grew significantly, from 59.8 million to 198.9 million, representing a 232.61% increase. </p>



<p>This influx of traders often coincides with heightened price volatility, and indeed, the price of FTM mirrored this activity, rising <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ftm-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from $0.40 to $0.81</a> within the same timeframe. However, the trend among traders exhibited a shift after March 8. The growth in their FTM holdings continued but at a more moderate pace. </p>



<p>This pattern persisted until March 22, when a noteworthy change materialized. Between March 22 and 23, the supply of FTM in the hands of traders underwent a significant decline, dropping from 217 million to 124 million.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="567" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ITB_ftm_balance_by_time_held_undefined_2024-03-25T12_12_28.209Z-850x567.png" alt="Balance by Time Held." class="wp-image-489721" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ITB_ftm_balance_by_time_held_undefined_2024-03-25T12_12_28.209Z-850x567.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ITB_ftm_balance_by_time_held_undefined_2024-03-25T12_12_28.209Z-360x240.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ITB_ftm_balance_by_time_held_undefined_2024-03-25T12_12_28.209Z-768x512.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ITB_ftm_balance_by_time_held_undefined_2024-03-25T12_12_28.209Z-150x100.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ITB_ftm_balance_by_time_held_undefined_2024-03-25T12_12_28.209Z.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Balance by Time Held.

<p>This sudden decrease can likely be attributed to the substantial price appreciation witnessed in the preceding days. Following such a rapid surge, it is a common phenomenon for some investors to capitalize on favorable market conditions. This often involves liquidating their positions and securing profits. </p>



<p>Consequently, this selling pressure from short-term holders likely fueled the observed rise in FTM held by mid-term holders. Their supply increased from 515 million to 608 million. This shift in ownership suggests a potential transition from short-term, profit-driven traders to investors with a longer-term perspective on the FTM ecosystem. </p>



<p>The observed movement could indicate growing confidence in the project&#8217;s future potential, with investors adopting a more patient holding strategy. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ftm-price-prediction-can-it-reach-a-new-2-year-high">FTM Price Prediction: Can It Reach a New 2-Year High?</h2>



<p>Examining the 4-hour chart for FTM price, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/moving-averages-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)</a> paint a bullish picture. We see a distinct layering effect, with the shorter-term EMAs positioned above the longer-term ones. </p>



<p>This signifies that recent price action has been dominated by aggressive buyers pushing prices steadily upwards. The shorter-term momentum is clearly leading the charge, further fueling this optimistic outlook.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="386" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FTMUSD_2024-03-25_10-20-28-850x386.png" alt="FTM 4-Hour Price Chart." class="wp-image-489767" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FTMUSD_2024-03-25_10-20-28-850x386.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FTMUSD_2024-03-25_10-20-28-360x163.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FTMUSD_2024-03-25_10-20-28-768x349.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FTMUSD_2024-03-25_10-20-28-1536x697.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FTMUSD_2024-03-25_10-20-28-2048x930.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FTMUSD_2024-03-25_10-20-28-150x68.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">FTM 4-Hour Price Chart. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/V4vUSDS5/?symbol=COINBASE%3ADOGEUSD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a>. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Adding weight to this bullish narrative is the price action itself. The current price sits comfortably above the key 20 EMA, and support has been repeatedly found near the 50 EMA. This consistent buying pressure and support at these important levels reinforces the notion that bulls are in control.</p>

<p>Should this momentum continue and the price manage to break decisively through the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-wallet-for-altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.22 resistance level</a>, a significant price advance could be on the cards. </p>



<p>A potential surge towards $1.50, a level unseen since late March 2022, becomes a realistic possibility. However, if a downtrend occurs, FTM could drop to $0.70 or even below $0.60 soon. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FTX has announced agreements totaling $884 million to sell a substantial portion of its shares in the AI startup Anthropic. </strong></p>



<p>This startup, supported by tech giants such as Amazon.com and Google, represents a significant part of FTX&#8217;s asset portfolio aimed at repaying creditors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ftx-lands-884-million-deal">FTX Lands $884 Million Deal</h2>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.deb.uscourts.gov/content/22-11068-ftx-trading-ltd-you-tube-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">court filing</a> with the US Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware, the major chunk of this investment, nearly $500 million, will be acquired by ATIC Third International Investment. This is a subsidiary of the UAE&#8217;s sovereign fund Mubadala. </p>



<p>The rest of the shares are distributed among several key players in the financial and tech industries. These include Jane Street Global Trading and entities associated with Fidelity Investments.</p>



<p>The move to sell approximately two-thirds of its Anthropic shares could significantly impact FTX&#8217;s efforts to repay creditors. The company acquired a 7.8% stake in the AI startup with a $500 million investment in 2021. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ftx-anthropic-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX&#8217;s strategic investment in Anthropic</a> notably paid off.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Given the increased interest in AI and large language models, there has been significant appreciation in the value of the Anthropic shares,&#8221; FTX <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-ftx-sell-shares-ai-startup-anthropic-2024-02-22/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is aggressively pursuing a $2 billion fine against Ripple Labs. </strong></p>



<p>The heart of the matter dates back to 2013 when Ripple allegedly initiated fundraising through the sale of XRP without proper registration.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-demands-2-billion-in-penalties-from-ripple">SEC Demands $2 Billion in Penalties from Ripple</h2>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s complaint outlines that Ripple raised funds through these unregistered securities offerings in the US and globally. It claims the firm distributed billions of XRP in exchange for non-financial benefits, such as labor and market-making services. This controversial approach to financing has put Ripple in the regulatory spotlight.</p>



<p>Adding to the gravity of the situation, Ripple executives, including notable figures Larsen and Garlinghouse, are accused of personally profiting to the tune of approximately $600 million from unregistered sales of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/xrp-ripple-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP</a>. </p>



<p>As a result, the SEC is seeking $2 billion in fines and penalties from a New York judge in the ongoing case against the company.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Our response will be filed next month, but as we all have seen time and again, this is a regulator that trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized, and designed to mislead. They stayed true to form here. Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple &#8211; and the industry at large,&#8221; Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty <a href="https://x.com/s_alderoty/status/1772339308151849153?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Polygon (MATIC) price managed to bring itself back above the $1 mark this week after nearly closing a daily candlestick below it.</strong></p>



<p>However, despite the bounce back, the altcoin did not manage to revive the investors’ interest, which might cause another decline.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-polygon-investors-are-taking-a-break">Polygon Investors Are Taking a Break</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/polygon-matic-network-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon investors play a huge role</a> in impacting the direction of the MATIC price, and these holders are taking a turn for the worse. Following the recent correction and the more recent scare of the altcoin losing $1 for good, investors have seemingly decided to pull back for now.</p>



<p>This is evident from the decline in the participation of MATIC holders on the chain. The addresses conducting transactions on the network slipped to 314,000 from the average of 408,000 over the past week.</p>

<p>However, the existing investors were not the only ones to note a 23% fall in participation as the bearish market cues spooked potential investors as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/polygon-price-correction-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New addresses forming on the network</a> ended up taking a hit, too, as potential MATIC investors turned away due to hesitation. Consequently, the network growth plunged, falling to its lowest point since December 2023.</p>

<p>This indicates that the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/matic-price-rise-threatened-crucial-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon native token</a> will probably be available for a while before it becomes the preference of both old and new investors again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-matic-price-prediction-an-important-support">MATIC Price Prediction: An Important Support</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/matic-price-drop-month-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MATIC price is trading above the $1 support</a> level at the time of writing, closing in on breaching the resistance marked at $1.02. Nevertheless, considering the aforementioned factors, the chances of a decline below the $1 support are very high.</p>



<p>If the cryptocurrency does end up falling below the $1 mark, it will find some support at $0.92, which will result in a post at $0.88. MATIC will thus register a monthly low.</p>

<p>However, if the $1.02 level is breached, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/polygon-price-correction-key-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MATIC price can manage to flip the $1.09 resistance</a> level into support, which would invalidate the bearish thesis. This would allow the altcoin to recover its recent losses, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The anticipation surrounding Bitcoin&#8217;s upcoming halving has sparked a notable shift in investors&#8217; sentiment. Goldman Sachs, for instance, is witnessing a surge in interest from its hedge-fund clients towards the crypto market. </strong></p>



<p>This resurgence in enthusiasm is not limited to the speculative individual investor but extends to the sophisticated institutional investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-goldman-sachs-investors-want-to-bet-on-bitcoin">Goldman Sachs Investors Want to Bet on Bitcoin</h2>



<p>Max Minton, Goldman Sachs&#8217; Asia Pacific Head of Digital Assets, said that the approval of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-prepare-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> has reignited the spark of interest among the firm&#8217;s clients. Many of them are either actively investing in the crypto market or exploring the potential to do so. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“It was a quieter year last year, but we’ve seen a pickup in interest from clients in onboarding, pipeline, and volume since the start of the year,” Minton <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-24/goldman-s-hedge-fund-clients-get-more-active-in-crypto-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Goldman&#8217;s current clientele, mainly conventional hedge funds, generate the bulk of interest. Additionally, the institution is broadening its reach to encompass a diverse range of clients. These include asset managers, its own banking customers, and certain firms specializing in digital assets.</p>



<p>Minton mentioned that clients engage with cryptocurrency derivatives to make speculative predictions, enhance yields, and hedge. He also noted that products related to Bitcoin continue to attract the most attention from clients. However, the level of interest in products associated with Ethereum could shift based on the potential approval of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/eth-etf-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum ETFs</a> in the US.</p>



<p>The impetus for this renewed interest can also be attributed to the forthcoming <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-halving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin halving</a>. Scheduled for late April, this event will halve the reward for Bitcoin mining, prompting miners to upgrade to more efficient technology to maintain profitability. This quadrennial update is critical for sustaining the economic model of Bitcoin, with the reward decreasing to 3.125 BTC from the current 6.25.</p>

<p>After the 2012 halving, the market capitalization of Bitcoin surged by more than 8,000%. In a similar vein, following the 2016 halving, Bitcoin&#8217;s value experienced a more than 1,400% increase. Meanwhile, it saw a rise of over 700% subsequent to the 2020 halving.</p>

<p>Although the stock-to-flow (S2F) model, typically applied to commodities like gold, has its flaws, it serves as one method for assessing Bitcoin&#8217;s value. This model has demonstrated a historical correlation with the price fluctuations of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin becomes increasingly scarce, experts project its value will climb from its current price.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for another seismic shift with its next halving event likely in April 2024. Historically, there is a correlation between halving events and subsequent increases in BTC’s price. Based on a stock-to-flow model, BTC could increase to over $130,000 by 2028,&#8221; Pedro Palandrani, Researcher at Global X, <a href="https://www.globalxetfs.com/the-bitcoin-halving-a-recurring-decimation-of-supply/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>.</p>

<p>From trading to blockchain innovation, Goldman Sachs&#8217; engagement with the cryptocurrency market reflects a broader institutional acceptance of digital assets. As the halving approaches, the bank&#8217;s proactive stance on digital assets, coupled with its clients&#8217; growing interest, represents a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
