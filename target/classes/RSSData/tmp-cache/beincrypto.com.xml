<p><strong>Polkadot price is witnessing the bullish impact of the positive interest it has received from institutional investors. The altcoin seems to be heading towards a previously failed high.</strong></p>



<p>However, it might face multiple resistances in its path, which could subdue the bullishness noted presently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-polkadot-outperforms-solana-and-cardano">Polkadot Outperforms Solana and Cardano</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/polkadot-price-consolidation-bearish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polkadot price recovered by 12% this week</a> and part of the credit for this goes to institutions along with retail investors. Their interest in DOT surged in the week ending March 23, so much so that they picked this altcoin over the likes of Solana and Cardano.</p>



<p>Polkadot recorded inflows worth $5 million, which, albeit not much, is still positive. On the other hand, SOL and ADA both observed outflows worth $5.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively. This shows that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-cardano-polkadot-developed-altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">institutions opted for DOT this week</a>, which also gave the price a boost.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="850" height="652" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-173601-1-850x652.png" alt="Polkadot Institutional Flows." class="wp-image-490626" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-173601-1-850x652.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-173601-1-360x276.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-173601-1-768x589.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-173601-1-150x115.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-173601-1.png 934w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Polkadot Institutional Flows.

<p>Similarly, retail investors are also exhibiting a comeback of the bullish sentiment following the recovery. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/polkadot-undervalued-institutional-interest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is crucial for Polkadot price</a> as optimism would induce conviction which would keep the altcoin trending upwards.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Polkadot-DOT-19.50.12-26-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="Polkadot Investors' Sentiment.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dot-price-prediction-will-investors-see-12-again">DOT Price Prediction: Will Investors See $12 Again?</h2>



<p>The bullish cues suggest that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/polkadot-price-dip-imminent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polkadot price is certainly on the path of recovery</a> and will continue rising. Over the past few weeks, the altcoin could be seen forming a rounding bottom pattern. This bullish reversal pattern suggested a potential rally of 31%, placing the target price at $12.</p>



<p>While DOT could not manage to fulfill this target during the previous bull run, it has a shot this time around, provided it can breach through the resistance levels marked at $10 and $11.</p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/dot-price-reaches-highfalls-last-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This local barrier might act as a hindrance to Polkadot’s rise</a>, and if it fails to breach these resistances, it could fall back down to the $9.2 support floor. Losing this level would invalidate the bullish thesis, causing a decline to $8.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is in a liquidity crunch as demand soars, driven by US ETFs and whale investors. With supply dwindling, prices may surge as availability hits historic lows.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Bitcoin faces a severe liquidity crisis as demand for the digital currency soars to unprecedented levels. </strong></p>



<p>According to analysts at CryptoQuant, monthly demand has rocketed from 40,000 BTC at the outset of the year to a staggering 213,000 BTC presently. This surge is attributed to the growing total balance of accumulation addresses, indicating heightened investor interest in securing Bitcoin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-liquidity-crisis-strikes-crypto-market">Bitcoin Liquidity Crisis Strikes Crypto Market </h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> in the US significantly contribute to the surge in demand for BTC. These ETFs, excluding GBTC, have seen their BTC balances swell dramatically. Indeed, from February 25 to March 17, their balances grew from 117,000 to 185,000 BTC. </p>



<p>This trend reflects the crucial role that institutional investments through spot ETFs are playing in amplifying Bitcoin demand.</p>



<p>Moreover, the appetite for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin among large holders</a>, or &#8220;whales,&#8221; is also witnessing a parabolic increase. The year-on-year growth in the total balance of Bitcoin whales — those holding between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC — has reached an all-time high of 1.57 million BTC, marking a significant acceleration from 874,000 BTC at the beginning of 2024.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="535" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-1-Year-Change-in-Whales-Holdings-of-Bitcoin-excludes-exchanges-and-mining-pools-850x535.png" alt="Bitcoin Whale Holdings" class="wp-image-490750" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-1-Year-Change-in-Whales-Holdings-of-Bitcoin-excludes-exchanges-and-mining-pools-850x535.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-1-Year-Change-in-Whales-Holdings-of-Bitcoin-excludes-exchanges-and-mining-pools-360x227.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-1-Year-Change-in-Whales-Holdings-of-Bitcoin-excludes-exchanges-and-mining-pools-768x484.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-1-Year-Change-in-Whales-Holdings-of-Bitcoin-excludes-exchanges-and-mining-pools-1536x967.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-1-Year-Change-in-Whales-Holdings-of-Bitcoin-excludes-exchanges-and-mining-pools-2048x1290.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin-1-Year-Change-in-Whales-Holdings-of-Bitcoin-excludes-exchanges-and-mining-pools-150x94.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin Whale Holdings. Source: <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CryptoQuant</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Concurrently, the sell-side liquidity of Bitcoin is experiencing a downward trend. The total visible amount of Bitcoin at key entities has dwindled to 2.7 million BTC. This is a sharp decrease from the all-time high of 3.5 million BTC in March 2020. </p>



<p>This imbalance between record-high demand and decreasing sell-side liquidity led to a historic low in the liquid inventory of Bitcoin. Estimates suggest that the current sell-side liquidity can only satisfy the surging demand for the next twelve months, assuming <a href="https://beincrypto.com/goldman-sachs-interested-bitcoin-halving/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demand from accumulating addresses</a> alone. </p>



<p>This situation becomes even more critical when considering the exclusion of Bitcoin on exchanges outside the US, with the liquid inventory dropping to just six months of demand. This exclusion is based on the premise that US spot Bitcoin ETFs primarily source Bitcoin from within the country.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Record Bitcoin demand paired with declining sell-side liquidity has resulted in the liquid inventory of Bitcoin plunging to the lowest ever in terms of months of demand&#8230; A declining liquid inventory would support higher prices,&#8221; analysts at CryptoQuant wrote. </p>

<p>The convergence of these factors signal a bullish future of the price of Bitcoin. Indeed, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1771038205623865426?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">added</a> that under these conditions price corrections &#8220;entail a max drawdown of around 30% in bull markets, with a max pain of $51,000.&#8221;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Whales capitalized on the recent dip to accumulate Cardano (ADA), leading to a noticeable stabilization in ADA&#8217;s price over the last week. This accumulation period coincided with a reduction in short-term traders holding ADA, suggesting a potential decrease in price volatility. </strong></p>



<p>Concurrently, the EMA lines for ADA price demonstrate a consolidation pattern, hinting at market equilibrium. Despite this, there&#8217;s an anticipation of a golden cross in the near future, a technical signal often associated with bullish momentum. This could indicate a positive turn for ADA&#8217;s price, suggesting that the current stabilization might be the precursor to an upward movement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whales-bought-the-dip">Whales Bought the Dip</h2>



<p>From March 11 to March 20, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ada-price-correction-continue-or-reverse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of Cardano experienced a decrease</a>, moving from $0.71 to $0.57. In this timeframe, the count of addresses holding over 10,000,000 ADA saw a slight increase, climbing from 397 to 403. This shift suggests that whales capitalized on the dip to bolster their ADA holdings.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="556" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.57.42-850x556.png" alt="Number of Addresses Holding At Least 10 Million ADA." class="wp-image-490556" style="aspect-ratio:1.5287769784172662;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.57.42-850x556.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.57.42-360x235.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.57.42-768x502.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.57.42-1536x1004.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.57.42-150x98.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.57.42.png 1652w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Number of Addresses Holding At Least 10 Million ADA.

<p>After hitting $0.57 on March 20, however, this trend of accumulation came to a halt, and the quantity of such high-volume <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-cardano-polkadot-developed-altcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA</a> addresses remained largely unchanged. A silver lining appeared despite the stagnation in whale numbers over the following week. </p>



<p>Between March 20 and March 25, ADA&#8217;s price rebounded to $0.66, offering a potential profit margin for those whales who had recently increased their stakes. This halt in accumulation post-March 20 might hint at a strategic pause by the whales, as they now possibly observe market dynamics closely, awaiting further price fluctuations to inform their next moves. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-number-of-traders-is-declining">The Number of Traders Is Declining</h2>



<p>Traders, identified as addresses that retain an asset for a duration shorter than one month, saw a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/cardano-usdm-stablecoin-hydra-layer-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noticeable increase for ADA</a>, with their numbers surging from 244,000 on February 1 to 303,000 by March 18. During this same timeframe, the price of ADA rose from $0.49 to $0.69. </p>



<p>This rise in the population of short-term holders is typically linked with heightened volatility for the asset, given these participants&#8217; propensity to engage in frequent buying and selling actions.</p>

<p>Yet, a notable shift occurred starting March 19, as the number of such traders began to taper off. From that date onwards, there has been a steady reduction in the count of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-yoroi-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA addresses categorized as Traders</a>. This number has marginally decreased to 299,000 from the peak of 303,000 observed a week earlier. Though this reduction might seem minor, it is significant enough to suggest potential upcoming trends in market behavior. </p>



<p>Specifically, a reduction in the number of short-term traders could signal a move towards reduced price volatility for ADA. This change could indicate a stabilizing market environment, as fewer traders engaging in rapid transactions may lead to a more steady and predictable price movement for ADA.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ada-price-prediction-will-the-uptrend-continue">ADA Price Prediction: Will The Uptrend Continue?</h2>



<p>ADA price grew 14.24% in the last six days. The big question is: Will the uptrend continue? Analyzing the 4-hour price chart, we see that the price line is currently above all EMA (Exponential Moving Average) lines, which is a bullish signal. </p>



<p>When a short-term EMA line crosses above a long-term EMA line, which is almost happening with the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/cardano-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA price</a> chart, it&#8217;s often interpreted as a bullish signal. This indicates that recent price momentum is outpacing the longer-term trend and could lead to an upward price movement. </p>



<p>This specific crossover event is known as a &#8220;Golden Cross,&#8221; a widely recognized indicator suggesting a potential long-term bullish breakout. </p>

<p>EMA lines are tools in technical analysis used to smooth out price data over specified periods, providing a clearer view of the price trend. Unlike simple moving averages, EMAs place greater emphasis on recent prices. That makes them more responsive to changes in the market and valuable for identifying trend directions and potential reversal points.</p>

<p>If the uptrend continues, ADA price could surge to test and break the resistance at $0.82 very soon. However, if the Golden Cross is not sustainable and a downtrend starts, its price could retract to the $0.56 zone. </p>

<p><strong>Optimism unveiled a plan to allocate $3.30 billion in funding toward developers who focus on the network&#8217;s success. </strong></p>



<p>The initiative is centered around the Retroactive Public Goods Funding model. It aims to encourage development within its ecosystem by rewarding projects that contribute meaningfully to the Superchain and Optimism.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-850-billion-op-tokesn-for-grants">850 Billion OP Tokesn for Grants</h2>



<p>Optimism&#8217;s <a href="https://optimism.mirror.xyz/nz5II2tucf3k8tJ76O6HWwvidLB6TLQXszmMnlnhxWU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">strategy</a> to stimulate innovation and collaboration within its platform will leverage a fund of 850 million <a href="https://beincrypto.com/optimism-price-golden-cross-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OP tokens</a> specifically for this purpose. The funding initiative seeks to support efforts across a wide array of categories, such as protocol and infrastructure development, governance improvements, and user experience enhancements.</p>



<p>Indeed, these efforts focus on Onchain Builders, OP Stack, Governance, and Dev Tooling, each targeting specific areas of development within the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/optimism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Optimism</a> ecosystem. </p>



<p>The funding program, scheduled to unfold in several rounds throughout 2024, features a new operational framework by design. This framework introduces a more structured approach by delineating specific contributions that will be eligible for funding. The aim is to clarify the process and criteria for applicants, ensuring that contributions align with the network&#8217;s objectives.</p>



<p>In response to the announcement, industry observers note the potential impact of such a substantial investment. Observers view Optimism&#8217;s funding initiative as a significant step toward supporting the development of a more open, fair, and decentralized internet.</p>



<p><strong>Read more: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/optimism-vs-arbitrum/">Optimism vs. Arbitrum: Ethereum Layer-2 Rollups Compared</a></strong></p>



<p>However, skepticism has emerged among some community members, attributed to the initiative&#8217;s perceived prioritization of developers over investors. </p>



<p>Edwin Osky <a href="https://x.com/Edwin0x0/status/1772669404511137960?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expressed</a> concern, stating, &#8220;They have shifted focus from the community to the developers.&#8221; Meanwhile, another community member <a href="https://x.com/AngelDelN/status/1772664801371566266?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">critiqued</a>, &#8220;This appears to be a case of developers diverting investor funds through Retro Funding, to the detriment of users.&#8221;</p>



<p>The effectiveness of this approach in driving meaningful innovation and collaboration within the ecosystem remains a topic of keen interest and speculation.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/doge-price-will-this-sell-signal-decline/">Dogecoin (DOGE) Analysis: Will This Sell Signal Cause a 26% Price Decline?</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Dogecoin (DOGE) price left meme coin enthusiasts rather elated in these seven days as the altcoin completed a 42% rally.</strong></p>



<p>But with the rise comes the potential for correction, and for the first time in 2024, the DOGE sell signal is at its strongest.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogecoin-holders-still-betting-on-a-rise">Dogecoin Holders Still Betting on a Rise</h2>



<p>As the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/x-twitter-ai-grok-dogecoin-doge-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogecoin price made its way up on the chart</a>, it left behind a rally huge enough to recover the losses witnessed by investors during mid-March. The 42% increase covered up the 26% crash, bringing DOGE closer to reaching $0.20.</p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-lists-3-altcoins-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This instilled confidence among DOGE holders</a>, who seem to be extremely bullish towards the coin. The same is evinced by the Open Interest, which refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts. These open contracts witnessed a 66% surge of $600 million as the altcoin consists mostly of long positions &#8211; hinting at a potential increase in price.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="210" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-184828-850x210.png" alt="Dogecoin Open Interest.

<p>Secondly, technical indicators paint a bullish picture, too. The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/rsi-indicator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Relative Strength Index (RSI</a>), which measures the speed and change of price movements, is in the bullish neutral zone. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a trend-following momentum indicator, also notes a bullish crossover.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="373" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MWfgAe5V-850x373.png" alt="Dogecoin RSI and MACD.

Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>These indicators hint at further growth in Dogecoin price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-doge-price-prediction-sell-signal-suggests-drop">DOGE Price Prediction: Sell Signal Suggests Drop</h2>



<p>Dogecoin price, by and large, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-better-shiba-inu-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seems to be suggesting an increase</a> in price is likely. If DOGE continues on this path and manages to flip the $0.182 resistance into support, it will be able to chart a rise to $0.20, marking a two-year high.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="373" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/w9elVMkO-850x373.png" alt="DOGE/USDT 1-day chart.

<p>However, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-price-fall-march-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price daily average addresses (DAA) divergence is signaling a sell signal</a>. This metric compares changes in the price of an asset with the number of new addresses interacting with it. This indicates potential discrepancies between price movement and user adoption or network activity.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dogecoin-DOGE-18.45.47-26-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="Dogecoin Price DAA Divergence.

<p>In the past, whenever this metric triggered a sell signal, the Dogecoin price witnessed a correction. Considering this is the first this year and a rather major one, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-price-downtrend-elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOGE could correct significantly</a>. The meme coin could drop through $0.164 and tag $0.151, which would invalidate the bullish thesis and cause a 26% decline to $0.135.</p>

<p><strong>Cube.Exchange has launched the Guardian Council, a robust assembly featuring industry stalwarts such as the Solana Foundation, Everstake, Triton One, Juicy Stake, and Kiln. </strong></p>



<p>This strategic coalition aims to establish a bulwark against unauthorized withdrawals, ensuring a fortified trading environment on the cryptocurrency exchnage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-unites-to-prevent-fraud">Crypto Unites to Prevent Fraud</h2>



<p>The Guardian Council <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/cube-exchange-guardian-council-fraud-prevention" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">embodies</a> a pioneering multi-party validation system, mandating consensus among diverse entities for transaction approvals. </p>



<p>This approach decentralizes decision-making andinstills a multi-layered defense mechanism against potential misuse of customer funds. Therefore, it significantly reduces the risk of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/sim-swap-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial wrongdoing</a> and crypto fraud.</p>



<p>Cube.Exchange&#8217;s initiative is a direct response to the industry&#8217;s urgent need for heightened security measures. Especially, after the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ftx-collapse-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX collapse</a>, highlighting the vulnerabilities inherent in centralized exchanges. By integrating independent third-party validators into its operational framework, Cube.Exchange sets a new industry standard. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The Guardian Council is just the beginning of this effort, and we will continue to bring to market more innovations that put security and user trust first,&#8221; Bartosz Lipiński, Cube.Exchange&#8217;s CEO, said. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The AVAX price grew by 8.15% over the past week, buoyed by bullish trends signaled by the Ichimoku cloud lines, indicating a potential for further growth of Avalanche. Currently, three-quarters of AVAX investors find themselves in the green, a significant statistic often preceding pivotal asset value movements. </strong></p>



<p>This upswing in market sentiment and technical indicators fuels speculation on whether such positive signs could push AVAX&#8217;s price toward the $70 mark. Investors and analysts alike are closely monitoring to see if this current wave of optimism signals a transformative phase for AVAX.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avax-currently-has-75-of-holders-at-profit">AVAX Currently Has 75% of Holders at Profit</h2>



<p>An impressive three-quarters of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/avalanche-avax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AVAX</a> holders, equating to some 5.72 million addresses, are now seeing profits following a recent uptick in the coin&#8217;s value &#8211; a noteworthy shift from the 50-60% profitability range that had been the norm over the preceding months.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="256" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-09.40.00-850x256.png" alt="AVAX Historical Break Even Price." class="wp-image-490494" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-09.40.00-850x256.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-09.40.00-360x109.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-09.40.00-768x232.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-09.40.00-1536x463.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-09.40.00-2048x618.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-09.40.00-150x45.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">AVAX Historical Break Even Price.

<p>The &#8220;Historical Break Even Price&#8221;, a vital metric revealing the average price at which all current holders would break even, shines a spotlight on the investment&#8217;s cumulative profitability. Notably, a previous climb to this 75% profitability threshold in 2021 preceded a sharp increase in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/trader-joe-avax-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AVAX&#8217;s price</a> from $75 to $117 in just 20 days.</p>



<p>Currently, with 21.95% of holders still in the red and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-avalanche-credit-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AVAX trading</a> 59.74% below its peak, the likelihood increases that these investors might hold onto their assets in anticipation of further gains rather than sell, especially considering the coin&#8217;s distance from its historical high.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ichimoku-clouds-are-drawing-a-potential-bullish-scenario">Ichimoku Clouds Are Drawing a Potential Bullish Scenario</h2>



<p>The Ichimoku analysis of AVAX reveals a moderately <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-add-avalanche-metamask/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullish sentiment</a> due to the price positioning above the cloud, which tends to indicate an upward trend. The cloud appears to be changing color from red to green, suggesting a shift towards a bullish market as Span A rises over Span B.</p>



<p>The Conversion Line, which represents short-term price momentum, is above the Base Line, a medium-term momentum indicator, further confirming the bullish sentiment for AVAX. The Lagging Span, however, is within the price range from 26 periods ago, indicating a lack of strong momentum, as ideally, it should be above the price action for a strong bullish confirmation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="386" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AVAXUSD_2024-03-26_09-43-35-850x386.png" alt="AVAX Ichimoku Lines and 4-Hour Price Chart." class="wp-image-490505" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AVAXUSD_2024-03-26_09-43-35-850x386.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AVAXUSD_2024-03-26_09-43-35-360x163.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AVAXUSD_2024-03-26_09-43-35-768x349.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AVAXUSD_2024-03-26_09-43-35-1536x697.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AVAXUSD_2024-03-26_09-43-35-2048x930.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AVAXUSD_2024-03-26_09-43-35-150x68.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">AVAX Ichimoku Lines and 4-Hour Price Chart.

<p>The Ichimoku Cloud is a technical analysis method that paints a dynamic picture of market trends and potential support or resistance areas on a chart. It combines five lines that show short to long-term price action and future projections, forming a &#8216;cloud&#8217;. A price above the cloud signals bullish conditions, while below indicates bearish trends. </p>



<p>The interplay of these lines also gives insights into market momentum and can signal potential reversals or continuations of trends. The price action remains above the Base Line, yet it closely follows the Conversion Line, which sometimes can act as a first level of support in an uptrend. </p>



<p>The absence of a bearish crossover, where the Conversion Line would drop below the Base Line, maintains the bullish outlook. As shown in the chart, the volume indicator is relatively low, which could question the strength of the current trend, and traders might look for an increase in volume to confirm further bullish advancement. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avax-price-prediction-will-it-reach-a-2-year-high">AVAX Price Prediction: Will It Reach a 2-Year High?</h2>



<p>AVAX&#8217;s price hasn&#8217;t reached $70 since April 2022. That could happen soon if AVAX is able to break some resistances ahead. </p>



<p>The In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) chart for Avalanche (AVAX) displays a concentration of support at the $53 to $54.75 price range, where <a href="https://beincrypto.com/major-bank-citigroup-avalanche-blockchain-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holders acquired</a> the largest volume of AVAX tokens. This is reflected in the presence of substantial green bubbles, indicating these holders are &#8216;in the money&#8217; and might act as a buffer against price declines. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="282" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.03.01-850x282.png" alt="Avalanche IOMAP Chart." class="wp-image-490518" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.03.01-850x282.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.03.01-360x120.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.03.01-768x255.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.03.01-1536x510.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.03.01-2048x680.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10.03.01-150x50.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Avalanche IOMAP Chart.

<p>The IOMAP chart is a visual tool that illustrates price levels where significant numbers of asset purchases have occurred, showing potential support and resistance zones based on the current price. It highlights where holders might be making a profit (&#8216;in the money&#8217;), breaking even (&#8216;at the money&#8217;), or experiencing a loss (&#8216;out of the money&#8217;). </p>



<p>Green areas signal large clusters of profitable purchases, indicating potential support, while red areas denote unprofitable ones, suggesting resistance. </p>

<p>On the flip side, resistance is building up in the $63.43 to $65.14 zone, as shown by the red bubbles, suggesting a sizable amount of AVAX tokens were purchased at these levels, placing those holders &#8216;out of the money.&#8217; </p>



<p>However, these resistances are not as strong as the close supports AVAX current has, which could indicate that if it can break the following resistances, if could easily continue the uptrend toward $70. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Tether, a stablecoin issuer with a market capitalization surpassing $100 billion, has announced a strategic pivot towards Artificial Intelligence (AI).</strong></p>



<p>This expansion signifies a bold move for the stablecoin giant, as it seeks to merge the blockchain industry and AI.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tether-pivots-into-ai">Tether Pivots Into AI</h2>



<p>Tether&#8217;s <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-expands-ai-focus-welcomes-top-talent-to-fuel-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">intent</a> is to play a pivotal role in making AI technologies more accessible and efficient. With its significant presence in various industries, including renewable energy, telecommunications, and Bitcoin mining, Tether is now positioning itself as a proponent of open and transparent AI development. </p>



<p>This comes at a time when the centralization of AI technologies has sparked debates around privacy and monopolistic practices. Last month, during an event on social media platform, X, Elon Musk made a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musk-vs-everyone-the-new-fight-in-ai-405becea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> regarding the ganders of AI monopoloes. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;There’s some value to there being multiple players in the AI space. You don’t want it to be just a monopoly or duopoly,&#8221; Musk said. </p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/tether-usdt-faces-restriction-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tether plans to address these concerns</a> by focusing on the development of open-source, multimodal AI models. Such efforts aim to democratize AI technology, fostering innovation and broadening access. The company will also integrate AI solutions into its market-driven products, transforming how cryptoand AI intersect to solve real-world issues. </p>



<p>In tandem with its AI ambitions, the company has announced a global recruitment campaign to attract <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/jobs-ai-candidate-section/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top artificial intelligence talent</a>.</p>



<p>Tether&#8217;s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, articulated the company&#8217;s vision, highlighting the impact of AI in digital and physical worlds. He also emphasized the synergy between Tether&#8217;s investment in Northern Data Group, and the company&#8217;s broader goals. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement establishes a new division within Tether, redefining AI boundaries and democratizing privacy-preserving open AI technology while setting industry benchmarks for innovation, utility, and transparency,&#8221; Ardoino said.</p>

<p>This strategic pivot by Tether marks a significant moment in the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ai-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">convergence of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence</a>. It suggests a future where the boundaries of these two transformative technologies are increasingly blurred, promising advancements that could have far-reaching implications for both sectors.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has designated Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) as commodities, setting a precedent in the regulatory oversight of cryptocurrencies. </strong></p>



<p>This clarification came as part of the CFTC&#8217;s civil enforcement action against the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin, which faces accusations of conducting illegal off-exchange commodity transactions without proper registration.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-and-litecoin-labeled-commodities-by-cftc">Ethereum and Litecoin Labeled Commodities by CFTC</h2>



<p>The legal action follows close on the heels of criminal <a href="https://beincrypto.com/kucoin-multibillion-criminal-conspiracy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charges brought against KuCoin</a> and its founders by the Department of Justice. It spotlights the stringent enforcement measures being applied to cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the US. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8884-24?utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">complaint</a> specifically targets <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/kucoin-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KuCoin&#8217;s trading practices</a>. These include the unregistered trading of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, all of which the CFTC now firmly categorizes as commodities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;KuCoin solicited and accepted orders, accepted property to margin, and operated a facility for the trading of futures, swaps, and leveraged, margined, or financed retail transactions involving digital assets that are commodities including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC),&#8221; the compliant reads.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Read more: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/kucoin-alternatives/">15 Best KuCoin Alternatives for US Crypto Traders</a></strong></p>



<p>This regulatory move has significant implications for the market, particularly in light of ongoing debates regarding the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-legal-officer-ethereum-not-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">classification of cryptocurrencies as commodities</a> or securities. Especially, with recent reports indicating that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is exploring a legal campaign to classify ETH as a security. </p>



<p>This development from the CFTC, however, leans towards reinforcing Ethereum&#8217;s commodity status. It could potentially influence the ongoing legal discourse around the nature of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p><strong>Ethereum (ETH) price bounced back this week from the lows of $3,100, reigniting hopes of new highs for the altcoin.</strong></p>



<p>However, the inclination of ETH investors toward realizing profits might impede this process.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-price-rise-warrants-restraint-from-investors">Ethereum Price Rise Warrants Restraint From Investors</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-ethereum-etf-no-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum&#8217;s price increased to $3,642</a> at the time of writing, and in doing so, it brought investors back on the network. However, their actions are not in line with the expectations.</p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-exchange-inflow-spike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The transfer of ETH from one address to the other</a> shows that the current price is higher than the last price. This signals the fact that the supply held by such addresses is bearing profits, which will push other investors to engage in the same.</p>

<p>This is an indication of the potential profit booking that might take place, which will accelerate selling among ETH holders.</p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-legal-officer-ethereum-not-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ETH price declining is already at a high risk</a> since investors have been offloading their holdings into exchange wallets. The net position change shows that about 374,130 ETH worth over $1.36 billion have been sold in the last ten days. In the past 24 hours alone, over 52,030 ETH worth $190 million was sold by the investors.</p>

<p>Thus, as profits run up, so will selling, which might result in the rally halting soon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eth-price-prediction-count-down-to-3-000">ETH Price Prediction: Count Down to $3,000</h2>



<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price managed to reclaim the 50- and 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). However, considering the sentiment of profit-taking, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-price-analysis-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ETH may trickle down to find support at $3,336</a>, which coincides with the 100-day EMA.</p>



<p>If this support is lost too, $3,031 is the next likely support floor, which is in confluence with the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement of $4,626 to $2,539.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bears-win-eth-price-falls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ETH has already flipped the 50% Fibonacci Retracement</a>. It could invalidate the bearish thesis if it sees further growth and flips the 61.8% Fib line into support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The developer behind the BALD meme coin has incinerated 600 million tokens, obliterating approximately 60% of its total supply. </strong></p>



<p>This drastic action took place over a five-hour span, catapulting the meme coin&#8217;s value by a staggering 60% and sending ripples through the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-60-of-total-bald-supply-burned">60% of Total BALD Supply Burned</h2>



<p>The BALD developer, notorious for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-twitter-sbf-bald-deployer-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">executing a rug pull</a> in August that saw 3,000 ETH withdrawn from the community, has reemerged with this significant token burn. Around 600 million BALD tokens, worth over $12 million, were destroyed, triggering a 59% price increase in less than 24 hours. BALD went from trading at $0.03489 to reaching a high of $0.05675.  </p>



<p>This move has sparked debates within the crypto community regarding the developer&#8217;s intentions and the future trajectory of BALD.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;BALD deployer, who famously rug pulled on Base when it first launched, is moving again. Just burned millions of BALD. LP not locked, though. Rumored to be Milky Way and doxxed,&#8221; a crypto community member <a href="https://x.com/MidasFoolsGold/status/1772520182013194737?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the BALD token burn, meme coins on Coinbase&#8217;s Base network experienced notable increases in their value. TOSHI, MOCHI, SMUDCAT, DEGEN, and BRETT have all surged, with gains ranging from 8% to an eye-watering 154%. </p>



<p>Despite this uptick, these coins still trail behind the market caps of their counterparts on other networks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Injective (INJ) price momentum turned bearish following the formation of its all-time high nearly two weeks ago.</strong></p>



<p>INJ is now recovering again, rising by more than 15% in the past three days, but will it be able to break consolidation?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-injective-investors-are-pushing-on">Injective Investors Are Pushing On</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/inj-price-new-all-time-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Injective price is currently trading at $40.17</a>, up from $35.02 just 72 hours ago. This has given bullish signs for investors once again, who were reeling from the 32% correction observed since mid-March.</p>



<p>As a result, as <a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-trading-falls-below-1b-injective-and-borroe-see-uptick-in-momentum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Injective price attempts to escape consolidation</a>, investors are contributing to the network as well. The addresses that have been conducting transactions on the network tend to drive the price. In the case of INJ, these are majorly dominated by investors at the money.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="567" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ITB_inj_historical_active_addresses_by_profitability_ethereum_2024-03-26T10_14_44.088Z-850x567.png" alt="Injective Active Addresses by Profitability.

<p>These investors are presently breaking even and are waiting for the price to shoot up in order to find profits. Their activeness shows that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/injective-stakes-coins-tvl-surges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">INJ holders are still optimistic</a> about the Injective price rising further, which will boost the bullish momentum.</p>

<p>However, an important cohort has been rather dormant and needs to engage in transactions in order to rally Injective prices. This cohort is the whale addresses that dominate more than 84% of the circulating supply of INJ.</p>



<p>At the moment, these holders are only conducting $7 million worth of transactions on average against the total volume of $14 million. This shows that despite their dominance, their participation is limited, which, if improved, would push the INJ price higher.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inj-price-prediction-45-is-the-target">INJ Price Prediction: $45 Is the Target</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/injective-impresses-with-99-30-day-gains-as-inquabeta-set-pace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">injective price is testing the local resistance</a> level marked at $41, which, if breached successfully, would enable INJ to rise further. Presently, the cryptocurrency is consolidated between $35 and $45.</p>



<p>Once the Injective price breaches $45, it would have a shot at rallying towards the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/inj-price-fall-all-time-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-time high of $51.85,</a> provided it can break through the $50 resistance level.</p>
