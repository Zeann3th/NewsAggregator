										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Quick Take</h2>
<p>According to data from <a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1772521628015956435?s=20">BitMEX</a>, the Bitcoin (BTC) ETF market experienced its first day of net inflows since March 15, collecting a modest $15.7 million, or 221.2 Bitcoin. This event paused five consecutive days of net outflows and represented the second-smallest day of inflows recorded. Despite this positive shift, the larger narrative remained overshadowed by the substantial outflows from GBTC, which amounted to $350.1 million or 4,933.7 BTC. Consequently, GBTC&#8217;s cumulative outflows have reached $14,150.6 billion, equivalent to 275,059 BTC.</p>
<figure style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJlC5iiXEAAMh2T?format=png&amp;name=large" alt="ETF Data in Dollars: (Source: BitMEX)" width="470" height="622" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">ETF Data in Dollars: (Source: BitMEX)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Data from BitMEX shows that Fidelity experienced an intense day with net inflows of $261.8 million, equivalent to 3,689.3 BTC, pushing its total inflows to $7,213.4 billion, equivalent to 136,886 BTC. It&#8217;s noteworthy that none of the remaining eight ETFs recorded any outflows. Both ARKB and BTCW remained stagnant, registering neither inflows nor outflows. As a cumulative figure, the Bitcoin ETFs have amassed $11,284.8 billion, equivalent to 200,673 BTC.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>SWIFT said on March 25 that it discovered several applications for its central bank digital currency (CBDC) solution following a successful six-month test.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SWIFT said on <a href="https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/new-collaborative-experiments-explore-more-complex-cbdc-use-cases">March 25</a> that it discovered several applications for its central bank digital currency (CBDC) solution following a successful six-month test.</p>
<p>The company did not create its own CBDC but instead developed an interlinking solution for existing CBDCs — dubbed the SWIFT connector.</p>
<p>The company wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At the core of our solution is the DLT and smart contract layer, which maintains consistent records of transactions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>SWIFT broadly described the platform as having applications in digital trade, securities, and foreign trade. It also noted that future versions of the platform could be expanded to areas beyond CBDCs, such as bank-led tokenized deposit networks.</p>
<h2>Smart contracts for TradFi</h2>
<p>Specific use cases include trade payments, foreign exchange, delivery versus payment (DvP), and liquidity-saving mechanisms.</p>
<p>SWIFT said its sandbox solution involves multiple digital ledger technology (DLT) networks. The company used <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/hyperledger/">Hyperledger</a> Besu for the tokenization platform. It used <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/r3/">R3</a> Corda and Hyperledger Fabric for buyer and seller networks and settlement instructions.</p>
<p>SWIFT also described atomic settlements and swaps, a blockchain or DLT-based approach to settlement involving the instant and simultaneous exchange of two assets. This type of settlement is similar to delivery versus payment (DVP) in traditional financial networks.</p>
<p>The platform also used smart contracts to automatically ensure that payments were executed once conditions were met. All four of SWIFT&#8217;s major use cases involved the use of smart contracts.</p>
<h2>Largest test of its kind</h2>
<p>SWIFT said its sandbox test involved 38 institutions over six months and called it &#8220;one of the largest known CBDC experiments to date&#8221; in this regard.</p>
<p>It added that, in terms of network activity, over 125 sandbox users carried out more than 750 transactions in the process. About 60 representatives from participating financial institutions participated in 20 collaborative working group meetings to discuss use cases.</p>
<p>The company plans to develop a production roadmap for the SWIFT connector but noted that progress will be based on &#8220;market developments and readiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>The service could meet growing interest in CBDCs around the world. Countries with active CBDCs include China, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria. At least 130 other countries and regions are also exploring CBDCs, with recent developments in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ecb-executive-pens-november-2025-rollout-for-digital-euro-cbdc/">Europe</a>, the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/philippines-to-launch-cbdc-within-2-years-to-counter-rising-crypto-use/">Philippines</a>, and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/spanish-central-bank-finalizes-partners-for-wholesale-cbdc-pilot/">Spain</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/ripple/">Ripple</a> CEO <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/brad-garlinghouse/">Brad Garlinghouse</a> and CLO Stuart Alderoty have revealed that the SEC is seeking a staggering <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1772339308151849153">$2 billion</a> in fines and penalties.</p>
<p>According to the company&#8217;s executives, the fines have been proposed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1772340438671966496">court filing</a> that will be unsealed on March 26.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Unhinged&#8217; SEC</h2>
<p>Garlinghouse said the SEC is seeking heavy penalties despite its claims involving &#8220;no allegations &#8230; of fraud or recklessness.&#8221; He added that there is &#8220;absolutely no precedent&#8221; for the request and asserted that Ripple&#8217;s response will &#8220;expose&#8221; the SEC.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1772340430597931132">another tweet</a>, Garlinghouse condemned the SEC by referencing an earlier decision that found the SEC lacked &#8220;<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">faithful allegiance to the law</span>&#8221; in its treatment of Ripple.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/chris-larsen/">Chris Larsen</a>, co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple, also commented, <a href="https://x.com/chrislarsensf/status/1772343294237847623">writing:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">&#8220;Gensler’s SEC has become unhinged.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Larsen added that the watchdog &#8220;thinks it&#8217;s above the law&#8221; and argued that this mentality has caused the US to lag behind other nations. He emphasized that the regulator&#8217;s failings &#8220;should not &#8230; go unnoticed in an election year.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Republican victory in this year&#8217;s US elections could lead to the SEC being restructured, possibly replacing current SEC chair <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/gary-gensler/">Gary Gensler</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alderoty separately asserted the SEC is &#8220;bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple.&#8221; He added that the regulator &#8220;trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized, and designed to mislead.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Institutional sales</h2>
<p>Earlier rumors suggested that Ripple could face a fine above $2 billion based on institutional sales of XRP, as past rulings only found that these offerings constituted securities sales.</p>
<p>On Feb. 26, Ashley Prosper <a href="https://twitter.com/AshleyPROSPER1/status/1761792125761454387">identified</a> 4.9 billion XRP of institutional sales in a court filing, leading to widespread predictions of $2.6 billion in fines based on a $0.55 token price.</p>
<p>However, as of March 25, XRP is priced somewhat higher at $0.66, putting the value of the same 4.9 billion XRP at $3.2 billion. This means that the SEC&#8217;s intended fine is either not based on the current XRP price or is less than the total institutional sale amount.</p>
<p>Programmatic sales of XRP, including on-exchange sales, did not constitute securities. The SEC also dropped allegations that Garlinghouse and Larsen&#8217;s personal XRP sales were securities. As such, those sale amounts likely did not contribute to the SEC&#8217;s currently requested fine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The DeFi Education Fund, a crypto advocacy group, and Texas-based apparel company Beba LLC have jointly initiated legal proceedings against the US SEC to clarify the status of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/glossary/airdrop/">airdrops</a> as non-securities offerings.</p>
<p>The March 25 <a href="https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_3f7a8f2ca6614d7381122cb1beeed4a8.pdf">court filing</a> emphasized the need to halt the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ripple-must-provide-financial-statements-at-secs-request-judge-rules/">SEC&#8217;s regulatory actions</a>, which the two entities perceive as an overreach into the emerging industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/fund_defi/status/1772277652742652359">According </a>to the DeFi Education Fund:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The crypto industry is facing an existential threat from an overzealous regulator who is abusing its power by targeting our industry through unending aggressive enforcement actions. It’s time for the court to put an end to it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Consequently, the lawsuit seeks a declaration from the Court that airdropped tokens do not qualify as securities. Additionally, it aims to prevent the SEC from pursuing further enforcement actions within the sector.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Airdrops are free&#8217;</h2>
<p>DeFi Education Fund Chief Legal Officer Amanda Tuminelli disclosed Beba&#8217;s apprehension regarding potential <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/sec-issues-new-investor-warning-over-crypto-assets/">SEC scrutiny</a> over its BEBA token airdrop.</p>
<p>To address this concern, Beba took legal action against the SEC to establish that the BEBA token airdrop does not constitute a security. The company asserts several grounds for this, notably the absence of monetary investment, lack of shared enterprise, absence of a reasonable expectation of profit, and absence of a contractual arrangement or scheme.</p>
<p>The lawsuit stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The BEBA token airdrops are free, there is no common enterprise between Beba and token recipients, and there is no reasonable expectation of profits based on the efforts of others.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>APA violations</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the lawsuit contends that the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/gary-gensler/">Gary Gensler</a>-led Commission breached the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by adopting a policy that asserted that almost all digital assets constitute investment contracts and most digital asset transactions qualify as securities transactions.</p>
<p>According to Tuminelli, this approach is a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/friend-tech-rebrands-token-to-keys-amid-speculation-of-sec-scrutiny/">consistent pattern</a> observed in the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions against actors in the emerging industry. She noted that the SEC <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/sec-denies-coinbase-petition-for-new-crypto-asset-rules/">has failed to provide detailed guidelines</a> for the sector because &#8220;they know they will face a massive backlash&#8221; and &#8220;they know Congress hasn&#8217;t given them the authority to cast such a wide net.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The SEC’s enforcement activities, whether they be subpoenas, secret investigations, or complaints filed in federal court, are unlawful and pose an existential threat to our future. They have to be stopped.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a dramatic opening to a much-anticipated trial, the US SEC cast <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/terraform-labs/">Terraform Labs</a> and its co-founder, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/do-kwon/">Do Kwon</a>, as central figures in a vast financial deception that left investors nearly destitute following its collapse, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/terraform-labs-civil-fraud-trial-set-begin-new-york-2024-03-25/">reported</a> on March 26.</p>
<p>The trial, unfolding in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, marks a significant moment in closing the chapter on one of the biggest black swan events in the crypto industry.</p>
<p>The SEC accused Terraform Labs and Kwon of conducting a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud, leading to the lawsuit filed in February 2023.</p>
<h2>House of cards</h2>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s legal team, led by attorney Devon Staren, did not mince words, describing Terra as a &#8220;house of cards&#8221; that inevitably toppled, erasing vast amounts of investor capital.</p>
<p>Central to the SEC&#8217;s allegations is the claim that Terraform Labs and Kwon deliberately misled investors regarding the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/terra-ustc-surges-66-following-approval-to-re-peg-to-1/">stability</a> of Terra USD (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/terrausd/">USTC</a>).</p>
<p>The algorithmic stablecoin <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/terra-co-founder-daniel-shin-blames-ecosystem-failure-on-do-kwons-management/">dramatically failed</a> to maintain its peg to the US dollar, resulting in billions of dollars being wiped from the network within hours. This failure is cited as a catalyst for broader turbulence in the crypto market during 2022, leading to a cascade of bankruptcies among various crypto enterprises.</p>
<p>Originally slated to begin in January, the legal saga was <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/sec-agrees-to-delay-terra-trial-so-that-do-kwon-can-attend-proceedings/">postponed</a> to March, partially due to expectations that Kwon would attend in person to mount a defense. However, Kwon remains in Montenegro after the country overturned a previous ruling to extradite him to the US.</p>
<p>In a December 2023 development, Judge Jed Rakoff issued a summary judgment favoring the SEC&#8217;s stance on Terra&#8217;s dealings with unregistered securities while siding with Kwon and the platform on charges related to the offer and sale of security-based swaps.</p>
<h2>Terra&#8217;s side of the story</h2>
<p>In a poignant message released just before the trial, Terraform Labs broke its recent silence, expressing the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>CEO Chris Amani <a href="https://twitter.com/fleece_cannon/status/1772312524559364498?s=46&amp;t=aw6ZR-6aD050XLPVXY8AQA">acknowledged</a> the intense preparation that preceded the trial and the company&#8217;s strategic decision to limit public communication during the proceedings.</p>
<p>Amani wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The next couple of weeks will determine the future of TFL. There have been a lot of allegations and this is our chance to finally tell our side of the story.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement urged followers and observers to keep an open mind and assess the facts as they unfold in court.</p>
<p>Gratitude was a recurring theme in the message, with heartfelt thanks directed toward the Terra community, which has stood by the company through tumultuous times. The acknowledgment extended to developers who continued to build on the Terra platform and partners who maintained their collaborations, illustrating a steadfast support network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The London Stock Exchange said in a <a href="https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/n0324.pdf">March 25</a> notice that it plans for Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to begin trading on May 28.</p>
<p>The latest announcement also details other key dates. The London Stock Exchange will begin accepting applications for admission from issuers on April 8. The FCA must also decide on base prospectuses that intend to launch on the first day of trading by May 22.</p>
<p>Issuers aiming for the May 28 launch date must submit a letter detailing how their ETN satisfies all requirements in a factsheet plus a base prospectus draft by April 15.</p>
<p>The exchange said its chosen launch date would allow the maximum number of issuers to be present on the first trading day. That date will give applicants time to prepare relevant documentation and allow the exchange to evaluate whether issuers satisfy requirements.</p>
<p>The launch date depends on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approving base prospectuses from applicants, as the authority must list crypto ETNs on its Main Market and Official List.</p>
<h2>Earlier expectations</h2>
<p>On <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-investment-options-to-debut-on-london-stock-exchange/">March 11</a>, the London Stock Exchange said it would accept applications in the second quarter of 2024 but did not provide a precise date.</p>
<p>It also provided a factsheet detailing various requirements, including a block on retail trading. Relevant funds must also be non-leveraged and physically backed by Bitcoin or Ethereum, held at least 90% in cold storage or an equivalent method, and kept with a qualified custodian.</p>
<p>Independent from the London Stock Exchange, the FCA said on <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-updates-position-cryptoasset-exchange-traded-notes-professional-investors">March 20</a> that it would not object to requests to create crypto ETNs from Recognised Investment Exchanges.</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s apparent willingness to permit crypto ETNs is notable as these vehicles provide professional investors in the country with new ways to invest in crypto.</p>
<p>Though crypto ETNs are similar to exchange-traded funds (ETF) in that they track the price of the underlying crypto, they otherwise differ in many aspects of their design.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/ripple/">Ripple</a>&#8216;s developer arm, RippleX, revealed that some of the recently introduced Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ripples-xrp-ledger-surging-network-activity-stirs-ddos-attack-concerns/">XRP Ledger (XRPL) encountered technical issues</a> that prevented transactions from processing correctly.</p>
<p>In a March 24 statement on X (formerly Twitter), the developers <a href="https://twitter.com/RippleXDev/status/1771961354297241930">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The discrepancy affected how the DEX payment engine routes liquidity through AMM pools and order books in some complex payment path scenarios.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/david-schwartz/">David Schwartz</a>, the CTO of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/ripple/">Ripple</a>, further explained that the issue did not originate from the single-sided deposit feature, as it aligns with the intended functionality of the AMM design. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Single-sided deposits allow for a more streamlined user experience, but can lead to price impacts when pools have less liquidity. It’s best for users to review the price impact in their tooling before submitting a transaction and front-end apps should display this information to users.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>AMMs were <a href="https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1771284874931925459?s=20">launched on XRPL</a> on March 22 after the community had waited two years. The project was designed to unlock additional liquidity sources and trading opportunities for XRPL users.</p>
<p>However, due to the early teething problems, AMM users have been advised against depositing new funds into these pools until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, RippleX revealed that a proposed solution is under community review and will soon be put to an amendment voting process.</p>
<h2 class="s3">&#8216;Canary network&#8217;</h2>
<p>XRPL developer Wietse Wind <a href="https://twitter.com/WietseWind/status/1771998717832278162?s=20">proposed</a> the concept of a Canary network for the blockchain network in response to the challenges encountered during the launch of AMM.</p>
<p>According to him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The recent finding of a bug in the freshly launched AMM on the XRP Ledger shows the need for better testing. Testing with real value, on a network that isn&#8217;t mainnet. Testing when an amendment is available, not when it was voted in and went live.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Canary network would operate independently with its native tangible asset. This setup will encourage real-life usage, providing a practical environment for users and developers to test and identify vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Notably, Wind&#8217;s idea echoes existing practices in blockchain development, such as <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum&#8217;s</a> utilization of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-holesky-testnet-launch-flops-relaunch-is-expected-in-coming-weeks/">multiple testnets like Sepolia</a>. These test environments serve as crucial <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-nears-staking-withdrawals-with-shapella-upgrade-on-sepolia/">platforms for testing upgrades</a> and amendments before their deployment on the mainnet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s trading volume on centralized exchanges (CEXs) saw a significant spike in March, marking the highest recorded CEX volume since May 2021 — and the month isn&#8217;t over yet. Monitoring trading volume on CEXs offers invaluable insights into market sentiment, liquidity, and the overall health of the crypto market.</p>
<p class="p1">From September 2023 to Mar. 24, 2024, Bitcoin&#8217;s trading volume on CEXs saw an <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/cexs-saw-record-breaking-trading-volume-as-bitcoin-touched-ath/">astronomical rise</a> from $18.409 billion to $494.056 billion. This eightfold increase in volume over just seven months is particularly noteworthy, considering Bitcoin&#8217;s price escalated from a close of $34,667 in September to over $73,000 in mid-March 2024. Despite a substantial correction, with Bitcoin consolidating at $67,000 by Mar. 23, trading volume continued its upward trajectory, indicating robust market participation and liquidity.</p>
<p class="p1">The distribution of this trading volume across various exchanges reveals a surprising trend, especially considering the significant role the US plays in the global crypto market. Despite hosting popular spot Bitcoin ETFs and driving much of the market sentiment, a comparatively <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/what-bitcoins-trading-patterns-on-centralized-exchanges-tell-us-about-the-market/">small portion of CEX trading volume</a> occurs in the US. On Mar. 24, data showed that 52% of Bitcoin&#8217;s total CEX trading volume was on Binance, aligning with the year-to-date average of above 50%. Following legal challenges last fall, Binance saw its BTC trading volume surge from $91.9 billion in October 2023 to $321.6 billion in March 2024, with the month yet to close.</p>
<figure id="attachment_406741" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-406741" style="width: 2025px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-406741" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-monthly-exchange-volume-btc-only.png" alt="bitcoin monthly trading volume CEX" width="2025" height="975" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-monthly-exchange-volume-btc-only.png 2025w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-monthly-exchange-volume-btc-only-300x144.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-monthly-exchange-volume-btc-only-1024x493.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-monthly-exchange-volume-btc-only-768x370.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-monthly-exchange-volume-btc-only-1536x740.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2025px) 100vw, 2025px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-406741" class="wp-caption-text">Chart showing the monthly spot market volume for BTC pairs across crypto exchanges from September 2023 to March 2024 (Source: <a href="https://newhedge.io/terminal/bitcoin/btc-monthly-exchange-volume">Newhedge</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">In contrast, Coinbase accounted for only 4.22% of the total CEX trading volume, ranking third overall, while OKX held the second position with just 6.41% of the total BTC trading volume. This dominance of Binance, raking in hundreds of billions in BTC volume, highlights its continued dominance in the CEX landscape, consistently accounting for half of the trading volume on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p class="p1">Binance&#8217;s position becomes even more pronounced when considering Bitcoin&#8217;s trading volume relative to the rest of the market. As of Mar. 24, Bitcoin represented just over 29% of the total crypto trading volume on CEXs, according to data from Newhedge. Despite the emergence of numerous altcoins and the growth of DeFi platforms, CEX volumes remain a critical gauge of market sentiment and an integral component of the crypto market infrastructure.</p>
<figure id="attachment_406742" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-406742" style="width: 2025px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-406742" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-btc-dominance.png" alt="Bitcoin dominance over total CEX volume" width="2025" height="975" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-btc-dominance.png 2025w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-btc-dominance-300x144.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-btc-dominance-1024x493.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-btc-dominance-768x370.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-btc-dominance-1536x740.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2025px) 100vw, 2025px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-406742" class="wp-caption-text">Graph showing the total crypto trading volume on centralized exchanges specifically attributed to Bitcoin from Feb. 23 to Mar. 24, 2024 (Source: <a href="https://newhedge.io/terminal/bitcoin/exchange-volume-btc-dominance">Newhedge</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">The significant price correction after Bitcoin&#8217;s peak in early March, coupled with the sustained increase in trading volume, suggests a market that, despite its inherent volatility, is moving towards greater resilience and stability over the long term. This indicates a maturing market landscape, where increased participation and liquidity contribute to a more stabilized price environment capable of absorbing market shocks and fluctuations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto-related investment products experienced a downturn after a streak of record inflows, with a total outflow of $942 million reported last week, according to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/coinshares/">CoinShares</a>&#8216; latest weekly <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-175-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-6af2a10c0b30">report</a>.</p>
<p>This marks the first instance of outflows in the past eight weeks, signaling the conclusion of an impressive <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/record-13-2-billion-ytd-inflow-into-digital-assets-eclipses-2021s-total/">seven-week inflow totaling $12.3 billion</a>.</p>
<h2>Market correction impacts crypto products</h2>
<p>The substantial outflows observed coincide with a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-sees-dramatic-slide-below-65k-over-four-hours/">price correction</a> in the crypto market, with <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&#8217;s</a> price dropping to a multi-week low of $60,976 and other digital assets following suit.</p>
<p>James Butterfill, CoinShares&#8217; research head, explained that this market correction slashed $10 billion from the total assets under management (AuM) for crypto-related investment products. Nevertheless, the current balance of $88 billion stands notably above previous market cycle levels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the overall trading volume for these investment products declined to $28 billion compared to over $40 billion recorded in the preceding two weeks.</p>
<p>Notably, this negative market performance engendered bearish sentiments among investors, resulting in diminished inflows of just $1.1 billion into the new spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US.</p>
<p>As a result, the modest inflows could not offset the substantial $2 billion <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/no-outflows-for-bitcoin-newborn-nine-etfs-as-grayscale-forces-154-million-net-outflow/">outflows recorded from Grayscale</a>&#8216;s Bitcoin Trust (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/products/grayscale-bitcoin-trust/">GBTC</a>). Consequently, Bitcoin-related products ended the week with a negative net flow of $904 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> also sustained outflows for the second consecutive week, with $34.2 million exiting the asset. This brings its month-to-date flow to a negative $46.2 million.</p>
<p>Other products, such as Multiassets and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">Solana</a>, also experienced outflows of $7.3 million and $5.6 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the negative sentiment reverberated globally, with products in various regions, including the US, Germany, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Sweden, all witnessing outflows. However, Canada and Brazil experienced minor inflows of $8.4 million and $9 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, even short Bitcoin positions experienced an outflow of $3.7 million last week.</p>
<p>On a brighter note, lesser-known cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/xrp/">XRP</a>, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/polkadot/">Polkadot</a>, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/avalanche/">Avalanche</a>, and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/litecoin/">Litecoin</a> saw modest inflows, indicating a positive week for these assets amidst the broader market downturn.</p>
