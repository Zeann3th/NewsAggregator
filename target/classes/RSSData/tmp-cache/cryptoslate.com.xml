										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/binance/">Binance</a> said it would end support for <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tron/">Tron</a> network-based USD Coin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/usd-coin/">USDC</a>) stablecoins by April 5, according to a March 25 <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-cease-support-for-deposits-and-withdrawals-of-usdc-via-the-tron-network-trc20-33df0ff0e2e94259950b5c4b1f4952f7">statement</a>, following recent news <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/circle-to-end-support-for-300-million-usdc-on-tron-amid-compliance-push/">Circle is pulling out</a> of the Tron blockchain entirely.</p>
<p>Consequently, Binance users have less than two weeks to withdraw their assets or convert them to USDC on alternative networks. Notably, transactions involving USDC via other supported networks like <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> remain unaffected.</p>
<p>Amid these developments, the Philippines&#8217; Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will reportedly block its citizen access to Binance within the next three months because the crypto trading platform is unregistered in the country.</p>
<h2>Why Binance ended support for Tron-based USDC</h2>
<p>Last month, Circle abruptly <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/circle-to-end-support-for-300-million-usdc-on-tron-amid-compliance-push/">announced</a> that it ended support for Tron-based USDC as part of &#8220;an enterprise-wide approach&#8221; involving various departments, including business organization and compliance.</p>
<p>In response, Tron network&#8217;s founder, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/justin-sun/">Justin Sun</a>, respected the company&#8217;s decision, adding that his blockchain network shares a decentralized structure akin to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum.</p>
<p>Notably, Circle had <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/circle-denies-terror-finance-claims/">disassociated</a> from Sun last year after <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/justin-sun-tron-respond-to-un-report-on-trc-20-usdt-use-in-illicit-finance/">reports</a> from prominent international bodies like the United Nations raised concerns about the blockchain&#8217;s alleged involvement in illicit financial activities.</p>
<p>USDC is the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization and has grown its <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/usdc-supply-surge-as-circles-expands-native-issuance-to-celo-for-better-payments/">circulating supply rapidly</a> since the beginning of the year. Blockchain <a href="https://tronscan.io/#/token20/TEkxiTehnzSmSe2XqrBj4w32RUN966rdz8">data</a> shows $172 million worth of USDC on the Tron blockchain.</p>
<h2>Philippines to block Binance</h2>
<p>The Philippines SEC reportedly <a href="https://mb.com.ph/2024/3/25/sec-asks-ntc-to-block-crypto-giant-binance-in-ph">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is warning the public against using online cryptocurrency exchange Binance, as it moves to have the platform blocked in the Philippines to safeguard the public from unregistered investment products.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The financial regulator further urged tech giants Google and Meta to cease Binance-related advertising targeting Filipino users on their platforms.</p>
<p>Last year, the Philippines SEC issued a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/philippines-sec-says-binance-operates-without-the-necessary-license-in-its-jurisdiction/">cautionary advisory</a> against the crypto trading platform, citing its unregistered operations in the Asian country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this prohibition marks the latest <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/binances-uk-subsidiary-withdraws-fca-registration-as-european-exodus-continues/">regulatory setback</a> for Binance, as it contends with heightened scrutiny across various jurisdictions, including the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/binances-changpeng-zhao-pleads-guilty-to-money-laundering-comments-on-resignation/">United States</a> and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/detained-binance-executive-escapes-from-nigerian-custody-amid-tax-evasion-charges/">Nigeria</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/arbitrum/">Arbitrum</a> Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is contemplating a $3.3 million <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/meme/">memecoin</a> fund to foster a memecoin-friendly ecosystem within the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> layer-2 blockchain network, according to a March 24 proposal on the platform&#8217;s discourse forum.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/arbitrums-memecoin-fund/22743?ref=daotimes.com">proposal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The motivation of the memecoin fund is to help the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole. Draw attention, new users, more chain usage, more DeFi activity, and more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The author wrote the proposal in <a href="https://twitter.com/0xKawz/status/1771501321595519145">response</a> to learning about new DeFi incentives, which they believe are throwing &#8220;more money at protocols so they can be farmed by whales/teams.&#8221; They further argued the DAO should &#8220;stop focusing on defi protocols&#8221; and &#8220;focus on bringing new participants that will inevitably use the defi protocols.&#8221; In a final call to action they declared,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I just wrote a proposal on the arb forums so I don&#8217;t look like just a shit talker without any action But that&#8217;s my last attempt to kickstart the conversation. Up to arbitrum now what to do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Arbitrum is the largest Ethereum-based layer-2 network, controlling more than 40% of the market. The total value of assets locked on the network currently amounts to $16.84 billion, according to L2Beats <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary">data</a>.</p>
<h2>Proposal details</h2>
<p>The proposal outlines the governance structure of the memecoin fund, consisting of five board members and three collaborators operating via a 5/9 multi-signature scheme. Notably, members of the board and collaborators would be barred from investing in tokens supported by the fund.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the proposal delineates criteria for selecting the memecoins, including secure contracts, widespread holder distribution, minimal whale holdings, ample liquidity, and a minimum market capitalization of $1 million.</p>
<p>The $3.3 million funding covers various expenses, including monthly compensation for board members, collaborators, and graphic designers. This funding also includes the initial allocation of $3 million worth of ARB, which will be used to start the fund for the first six months.</p>
<p>The proposed timeline anticipates the fund&#8217;s swift launch, followed by a six-month promotional period. However, the proposal allows for a reassessment after this period, with the Arbitrum DAO empowered to vote on increasing funding or terminating the memecoin fund entirely. In the event of dissolution, assets will be converted to the ARB token and returned to the Arbitrum DAO.</p>
<h2>Memecoins popularity</h2>
<p>The Arbitrum Foundation proposal comes when memecoins have become increasingly popular in<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/solana-ceo-anatoly-yakovenko-denounces-influx-of-racist-and-offensive-memecoins/"> the crypto industry.</a></p>
<p>Over the past weeks, these digital assets have driven <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/amid-investor-craze-solana-memecoin-founder-accidentally-burns-10-million-pre-sale-tokens/">network activity</a> on the Solana blockchain and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-backed-base-leads-in-ethereum-layer-2-fees-amid-trading-activity-surge/">Coinbase-backed layer-2 network Base.</a></p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Avalanche Foundation <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/avalanche-foundation-buys-self-proclaimed-completely-useless-memecoins-for-treasury/">acquired</a> five memecoins, including Coq Inu, Gecko, Kimbo, NoChill, and Tech, as part of its Culture Catalyst program to promote broader blockchain adoption.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Quick Take</h2>
<p>Bitcoin, often referred to as &#8216;digital gold,&#8217; is nearing a notable juncture, as its market capitalization approaches 10% of gold&#8217;s massive $14.55 trillion market cap, currently at 9.5%, according to data from the <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">Clarkmoody dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin hovers at approximately $67,000, its market capitalization stands at an estimated <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/">$1.314 trillion</a>. This comes amidst a year of impressive growth for Bitcoin, with its value increasing by 58% compared to gold&#8217;s 5%.</p>

<p>This shift isn&#8217;t limited to capitalization alone. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) revolving around the two assets are seeing <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-etfs-attract-4-1-billion-amid-3-billion-gold-outflows/">divergent trends</a>. Gold ETFs are experiencing significant outflows, with the <a href="https://bold.report/gold/fund-flows">Bold Report</a> noting 2.7 million ounces of gold flowing out over a 90-day period. At its peak in March, gold outflows hit over 4.1 million ounces.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that in the past week, Gold ETFs have experienced substantial inflows of approximately 530,537 ounces, mainly coming from SPDR Gold Shares, according to the Bold Report.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/binance/">Binance</a> confirmed to <em>CryptoSlate</em> that Nadeem Anjarwalla, one of its executives detained by the Nigerian authorities, has escaped custody.</p>
<p>A Binance spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We were made aware that Nadeem is no longer in Nigerian custody. Our primary focus remains on the safety of our employees and we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to quickly resolve this issue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Tigran Gambaryan, the other detained Binance executive and US citizen, remains in custody of the authorities.</p>
<p>Amid this development, the Nigerian authorities have <a href="https://guardian.ng/breakingnews/nigeria-files-tax-evasion-charges-against-binance/?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;echobox=twitter_post&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1711355227">reportedly</a> levied a four-count tax evasion charge and complicity in tax fraud against Binance Holdings and the detained executives. The case is pending trial at the Federal High Court.</p>
<h2>How Anjarwalla escaped</h2>
<p>Anjarwalla, holding dual citizenship from Kenya and the UK, <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/680511-exclusive-detained-binance-executive-escapes-from-custody-in-nigeria.html">reportedly</a> absconded on March 22 during Friday prayers at a mosque in Abuja.</p>
<p>According to the report, Anjarwalla used a Kenyan passport to board a flight operated by an unnamed Middle Eastern airline.</p>
<p>The authorities are puzzled over how Anjarwalla obtained this new passport, especially since he possessed no travel documents except his British passport when taken into custody.</p>
<p>There are suggestions that Anjarwalla might have planned his escape, leveraging certain privileges granted to him during detention, such as access to telephones.</p>
<p>While Nigerian authorities have not yet released an official statement, there are speculations of ongoing covert operations to ascertain his destination and facilitate his return to custody.</p>
<h2>Binance vs Nigeria</h2>
<p>This development further complicates the ongoing tensions between Nigeria and Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume.</p>
<p>Recently, Nigerian authorities have accused Binance of exacerbating the country&#8217;s foreign exchange challenges by allegedly manipulating rates for personal profit. This led to the exchange&#8217;s official website being <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/nigeria-reportedly-considers-10-billion-binance-fine-over-illegal-transactions-and-registration/">blocked</a> and the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/former-us-irs-agent-among-binance-staff-detained-in-nigeria/">detention of the two senior executives who</a> attempted to address the concerns.</p>
<p>Notably, a High Court <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/nigeria-intensifies-probe-into-binance-with-court-ordered-data-disclosure/">directed</a> Binance to provide the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) with data related to Nigerian users on its platform. However, the crypto trading platform has yet to comply with this directive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the detention of these executives sparked <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/kenya-and-us-crypto-groups-unite-in-demand-for-release-of-detained-binance-execs-in-nigeria/">widespread condemnation</a> from international crypto organizations, particularly in the United States and Kenya, who criticized the actions of the Nigerian government.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Quick Take</h2>
<p>Analyzing Bitcoin&#8217;s net profit/loss, a key metric calculated from the difference between realized gains and losses. Utilizing a seven-day moving average to sift through the noise and pinpoint a more accurate trend, Bitcoin&#8217;s net realized profit nearly matched its record high set in January 2021 &#8211; a whopping $3.8 billion.</p>
<figure id="attachment_406683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-406683" style="width: 638px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-406683" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/RPL.png" alt="Net Realized Profit/Loss: (Source: Glassnode)" width="638" height="359" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/RPL.png 1800w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/RPL-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/RPL-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/RPL-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/RPL-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-406683" class="wp-caption-text">Net Realized Profit/Loss: (Source: Glassnode)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This trend was particularly notable on March 14, when Bitcoin reached its zenith of roughly $73,600, witnessing approximately $3.6 billion in net realized profit.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this cyclical trend of net realized profit-taking has been on the rise. On Feb. 26, <em>CryptoSlate</em> recorded a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-investors-realize-net-profits-for-128-consecutive-days/">128-day</a> net realized profit-taking. Fast forward a month, and the number surged to 157 days, surpassing the 155-day period in 2021.</p>
<p>As of March 24, net realized profit dropped to $1.5 billion, slightly higher than pre-peak figures but less than half of the peak at $3.6 billion. This decline corresponds with <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/500-million-liquidated-as-bitcoin-breaks-below-64k/">Bitcoin&#8217;s dip</a> from its peak, an event largely attributed to the record <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/short-term-holders-transfer-record-4-3-billion-in-profits-to-exchanges/">profit-taking</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recent EU anti-money laundering regulations (AMLR) have sparked a heated debate about balancing combating financial crime and preserving citizens&#8217; rights to privacy and economic freedom. The new laws, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/CJ12/AG/2024/03-19/1297044EN.pdf">approved by most</a> of the EU Parliament&#8217;s lead committees, have drawn criticism and support from various stakeholders.</p>
<p>Following an article from Finbold on March 22, <a href="https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1771929859704389954/photo/2">originally titled</a> &#8220;Anonymous crypto wallets now illegal in the EU,&#8221; a flurry of <a href="https://twitter.com/freddienew/status/1771492593676714091?t=wxOs6dz_yXlLV9YPYuRzvA">activity</a> occurred over the weekend on social media. The article used a <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/eu-cash-cap-and-ban-on-anonymous-crypto-payments-results-in-financial-paternalism/">blog post</a> by Patrick Breyer, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), as the core source and took a scathing view of the restrictive new legislation. The article&#8217;s title has since been updated to &#8220;EU bans anonymous crypto payments to hosted wallets&#8221; following debate on whether the article&#8217;s focus was overly alarmist.</p>
<h2>Why anonymous crypto wallets were thought to be banned</h2>
<p>Breyer&#8217;s original post highlighted that anonymous cash payments over €3,000 in commercial transactions will be banned under the new regulations, and cash payments over €10,000 will be prohibited entirely in business transactions. Additionally, anonymous crypto payments to hosted wallets will be banned without a minimum threshold.</p>
<p>Breyer, a self-proclaimed digital freedom fighter from the Pirate Party, voiced <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/eu-cash-cap-and-ban-on-anonymous-crypto-payments-results-in-financial-paternalism/">strong opposition to the new laws</a> in his post. He argues that prohibiting anonymous payments would have minimal effects on crime while depriving innocent citizens of their financial freedom and privacy. Breyer points out that dissidents like the late Alexei Navalny and his wife and organizations like Wikileaks rely on anonymous donations, often in virtual currencies, to fund their activities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Breyer expresses concern about the potential consequences of the EU&#8217;s &#8220;war on cash.&#8221; He warns that the creeping abolition of cash could lead to negative interest rates and increased dependence on banks, ultimately resulting in financial disenfranchisement. Instead, he calls for ways to bring the best attributes of cash into the digital future, allowing citizens to pay and donate online without their personal transactions being recorded.</p>
<h2>Payments to anonymous wallets are banned from exchanges</h2>
<p>However, Patrick Hansen, the EU Director of Strategy for Circle, has <a href="https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/thread/1771929859704389954">sought to clarify</a> what he believes to be misinformation surrounding the AMLR. Hansen, a former MEP staff member, reported regularly on EU legislation before joining Circle and has shown a comprehensive understanding of policy. Hansen emphasizes that self-custody wallets and payments to/from these wallets are not banned under the new regulations. P2P transfers are also explicitly excluded from the AMLR.</p>
<p>However, Hansen acknowledges that paying merchants with crypto using a non-KYC&#8217;d (Know Your Customer) self-custody wallet will become more difficult or banned, depending on the merchant&#8217;s setup. He notes that the AMLR applies only to &#8216;obliged entities&#8217; and service providers, not providers of hardware, software, or self-custody wallets that don&#8217;t have access to or control over the crypto-assets.</p>
<p>Under the AMLR, crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) such as exchanges will be required to follow standard KYC/AML procedures and be prohibited from providing anonymous accounts or accounts for privacy coins. Hansen argues that this aligns with existing practices and is nothing new in the industry.</p>
<p>For transfers between CASPs and self-custody wallets, the AMLR mandates &#8220;risk-mitigating&#8221; measures, such as blockchain analytics or collecting additional data about the origin/destination of the crypto-assets. This aligns with the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR), the EU implementation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) travel rule.</p>
<h2>Regulatory debate on self-custodied crypto wallets in European Union continues</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the debate surrounding the EU&#8217;s new anti-money laundering regulations highlights the ongoing tension between combating financial crime and preserving citizens&#8217; rights to privacy and economic freedom.</p>
<p>While critics like Patrick Breyer see the regulations as a significant threat to these rights, others like Patrick Hansen believe that the rules largely align with existing practices and that some concerns may be overblown. As the regulations come into effect, it will be crucial to monitor their impact on the fight against money laundering and the rights of EU citizens.</p>
<p>It is clear that the new regulations are exceedingly strict, and there is a debate as to how requiring wallets to be KYC&#8217;d will stop illicit activity. Criminals illegally sending crypto to anonymous wallets may now simply be breaking <a href="https://x.com/akibablade/status/1771488393706213662?s=20">two laws as opposed to one</a>, while private citizens may potentially be required to KYC in order to pay for a coffee with a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-lightning-network-experiences-capacity-and-channel-surge/">Lightning Wallet</a>.</p>
<p>Still, a critical fact remains: holding crypto in an anonymous, non-KYC wallet will not be illegal in the EU. There will just be severe limitations on what can be done with it without being doxed. When the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ecb-executive-pens-november-2025-rollout-for-digital-euro-cbdc/">latest plans for the digital Euro CBDC</a> are considered, restrictions on money transfers may become even stricter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/blackrock/">BlackRock</a> and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/fidelity-investments/">Fidelity Investment&#8217;s</a> spot Bitcoin ETFs — <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/products/category/bitcoin-etf/">IBIT</a> and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/products/fidelity-wise-origin-bitcoin-trust/">FBTC</a> — have become the most popular funds the two asset managers currently offer in less than 50 days of trading, based on <a href="https://twitter.com/ericbalchunas/status/1771185154221850921?s=46&amp;t=wxOs6dz_yXlLV9YPYuRzvA">data</a> shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.</p>
<p>IBIT and FBTC were launched on Jan. 11 and have consistently posted <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-record-10-billion-in-daily-volume-breaking-previous-record/">record-setting numbers</a> and generally outperformed the wider ETF market. The strong performance is evidence of Bitcoin&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/blackrock-sees-bitcoin-as-integral-part-of-financial-system-little-interest-in-other-crypto/">growing popularity</a> in traditional financial circles.</p>
<h2>49-day streak</h2>
<p>According to the data, IBIT made up more than half of BlackRock&#8217;s net inflows for the year despite the company&#8217;s large portfolio of 420 ETFs. The <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> fund has attracted <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-surpasses-10b-in-aum-faster-than-any-other-to-date/">double the capital</a> of every other ETF offered by the company since its launch in January.</p>
<p>Similarly, FBTC accounted for 70% of Fidelity&#8217;s YTD flows, attracting 5x more capital than any other ETF in the company&#8217;s lineup. These figures highlight the significant role these ETFs play in attracting investor capital.</p>
<p>Balchunas also highlighted that the two <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/products/category/bitcoin-etf/">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> have also achieved a notable milestone by securing continuous cash inflows for 49 consecutive days, a rare achievement in the ETF market.</p>
<p>This achievement places them fourth among active streaks, trailing only behind $COWZ and $CALF — which have seen over 100 days of continuous inflows, and $SDVY.</p>
<p>The sustained inflows into IBIT and FBTC indicate growing investor interest and confidence in these ETFs. Such consistent performance is exceptional, with only 30 other ETFs ever having achieved a similar streak of inflows and none from their launch like the two funds have.</p>
<h2>ETF hodlers?</h2>
<p>Recent discussions have focused on ETF investor behavior, especially during market dips. Despite perceptions of ETF investors withdrawing during downturns, the actual movements in the market present a different picture.</p>
<p>Balchunas challenged recent assertions in the community that ETF investors lack sophistication or resilience. He noted that the Newborn Nine collectively received about <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1771248222444437764">$1.2 billion</a> over the past five days, even as Bitcoin prices fell by 8%.</p>
<p>This inflow contradicts the idea of mass withdrawals from Bitcoin-related ETFs and indicates strategic investment choices by ETF investors.</p>
<p>Balchunas further clarified that while $GBTC experienced outflows, these actions primarily involved strategic exchanges by Genesis and did not signify a broader lack of confidence among ETF investors.</p>
<p>In fact, these movements were largely neutral in impact. He also pointed to historical data supporting the resilience of ETF investors. In 2008, ETFs attracted $167 billion in inflows when the S&amp;P 500 was down by 35%.</p>
<p>Similarly, in 2021, despite an 18% drop in the S&amp;P 500, ETFs drew another $600 billion. These events highlight the strategic patience and confidence of ETF investors across various market conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of privacy protection is the Original Sin of all public blockchains – from Satoshi&#8217;s original Bitcoin whitepaper down to the most cutting-edge, modular, and parallelized network that does 100 million transactions per second with a zeptosecond finality time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, user privacy goes against the nature of public blockchains: For a public ledger to function, some transaction data must be shared with nodes and network participants. The shortcut to quickly getting these systems online is simply to just make everything public by default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that ultimate transparency exposes users to surveillance, coercion, and unintended consequences like trade signal leakage. This is commercially unviable and corrosive of the right to determine one&#8217;s destiny. True self-custody cannot exist if users don&#8217;t control their data; privacy is about reinstating users&#8217; freedom to select what they do and don&#8217;t reveal to the outside world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are seven fatal flaws that are common in crypto privacy tools:</span></p>
<h2><b>Sin 1 – Centralized Systems</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a decentralized world, centralization is </span><b><i>sloth</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s easier (faster and cheaper) to run a ledger on a bank&#8217;s internal SQL database than sending transactions on even the most performant blockchains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, decentralization equates to resilience. It’s the reason crypto has any market value. Without it, users would be better off with centralized institutions&#8217; speed and cost savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is even more important for privacy protocols, where centralization means developers are giving themselves privileged access to users’ data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protocol creators should </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">never</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> give themselves admin keys that can freeze or deanonymize users. (RAILGUN uses mechanisms like </span><strong><a href="https://docs.railgun.org/wiki/learn/wallets-and-keys#viewing-keys">Viewing Keys</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide non-discriminatory, user-controlled transparency where needed.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another centralization vector is threshold multi-sigs, particularly for protocols seeking to bypass insecure bridges. Even when set up “properly,” a 3 of 5 multi-sig is arguably worse regarding trust assumptions than your neighborhood bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when the multi-sig isn’t configured correctly….  </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-404796 aligncenter" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-11.17.58 PM.png" alt="" width="451" height="443" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-11.17.58 PM.png 514w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-11.17.58 PM-300x295.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></p>
<h2><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-404797 aligncenter" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-11.18.39 PM.png" alt="" width="451" height="406" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-11.18.39 PM.png 451w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-11.18.39 PM-300x270.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></h2>
<h2><b>Sin 2 – Lust for Logging</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy tools should take every measure to ensure no tracking of user activity, particularly personally identifiable data such as IP addresses and browsing activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy protocols should be designed with an all-encompassing philosophy that only uses a momentary lack of judgment to deanonymize users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Railway Wallet (which has integrated RAILGUN privacy tech) proxies RPC calls by default for all users so that even if someone isn&#8217;t using a VPN (which they should <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), their IP isn’t leaked to RPC nodes.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sin 3 – Encrypted State</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why not make the entire system private? It&#8217;s tempting… but having a fully encrypted state is as undesirable, in some ways, as being fully public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The encrypting state creates a black box where users and observers do no know what the dApp is doing. It eliminates the most significant security feature of blockchains: public auditability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the dApp is private, how do you verify that economics and actors are acting correctly? How do you respond properly to an exploit or malicious attempt if you don’t know if something has happened?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">User privacy is good – and so is protocol transparency.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sin 4 – Dependency on Specific Manufacturers</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being “trustless&#8221; means you don&#8217;t have to trust a third party (i.e., a company, agent or bank teller) to ensure a protocol works. A strength of zero knowledge-based encryption is it creates fewer dependencies, including on manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider, for example, if you create a privacy system that relies on Software Guard Extensions built by Intel into their CPUs. The security of your system depends on a potential single point of failure – trusting Intel to have implemented its product correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intel&#8217;s incentives are to act appropriately, but relying on SGX creates a constant vulnerability and unnecessary assumption of trust. There are also gatekeeping-by-design considerations, as SGX requires specialized hardware that is relatively expensive, obscure and hard to maintain –. In contrast, a proof-of-stake validator can be run on a Raspberry Pi.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sin 5 – Going rogue</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto privacy is a compelling narrative, but it’s not a strong enough value proposition to warrant building an entirely new blockchain or rollup (unless the specialty chain brings a strict technical innovation).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy systems are most impactful when available on chains where users and financial activity exist. For better or worse, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/glossary/defi/">DeFi</a> has congregated around <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/glossary/evm/">EVM</a>, and a few other environments like <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">Solana</a>. Solidity is the king and thus has benefited from the most security research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spinning up a novel execution environment and enticing developers and users takes time and often unsustainable incentives. Meanwhile, billions of dollars in value is already sitting on public chains desperately needing privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dedicated privacy chains also create additional security questions, such as requiring bridges – which have been demonstrated time and time again to be the least secure component of blockchain networks. Other concerns include centralization of consensus, validation and sequencers.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sin 6 – Builder Complexity</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers are often thought of as being geniuses (and some are). However, cryptography is difficult enough that forcing builders to learn and use a proprietary language, toolchain, or ecosystem is unnecessarily complex and counterproductive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contracts written in languages like Solidity or Vyper are portable among networks supporting EVM. That&#8217;s not the case for Rust and other WebAssembly chains. They all have their own standards for runtime. From a builder standpoint, that means separate contract codebases need to be maintained for each chain despite them using the same language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the product is less accessible.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sin 7 – Immature Tech</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Magic Internet Money&#8221; is a genuinely excellent meme. However, crypto developers are building financial technology that has real-world consequences and handles real money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy tech has the double duty of taking the “realness of money” into account and &#8220;privacy&#8221; itself – i.e., it has to be secure against financial exploits AND anything that may deanonymize users. The significant body of existing academic research on the technology is there for a reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lest you end up like </span><strong><a href="https://medium.com/@neha/cryptographic-vulnerabilities-in-iota-9a6a9ddc4367">IOTA</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a tried-and-true axiom is &#8220;never roll your cryptography.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy tech, in particular, should be battle-tested and thought-through, with extensive audits from security firms, assessments from privacy advocates, pen testing by white hats, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, how can you expect people – especially the hoped-for new mainstream users – to risk their identity and money on a complex technological platform?</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public blockchains are “dox-by-design.” It’s no easy feat to build on-chain privacy systems while preserving the reasons to use crypto in the first place, such as auditability and decentralization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great resource for assessing the privacy levels of your chosen privacy tool is the </span><a href="https://github.com/web3privacy/web3privacy/blob/main/Web3privacynowplatform/scoringmodel/Scoring%201.2%20community%20reflection.md"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Web3 Privacy</strong> <strong>Now initiative</strong></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which have categorized and scored various crypto privacy tools. Check it out as an excellent first step toward safeguarding your online identity and your finances.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web3 has always felt like an inclusive and empowering community to be a part of. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In making the transition from traditional finance to <a href="http://cryptoslate.com/defi">DeFi</a>, there has been no lack of support, encouragement, and guidance. Embodying a leadership role as a female has also felt free from obstacles or adversity.</span></p>
<h2><b>Gender Gap Still Evident</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite personal experience, it cannot be ignored that the evident gender gap in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/web3/">Web3</a> has been brought to attention recently. With the recent celebration of International Women&#8217;s Day, the community must acknowledge that </span><strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/09/13/from-glass-ceiling-to-digital-frontier-women-in-web3-and-ai-are-essential/?sh=2babbd765065">only 13% of founding teams in Web3 include at least ONE woman. </a></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 data from Swiss Fintech Innovations also highlighted that </span><strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemmagreen/2024/03/06/why-women-matter-in-shaping-the-future-of-web3-innovation/?sh=304a7087d370">only 3.5% of Web3 investment reached women-led Web3 business </a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the first half of 2023.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, there is a disparity and a balance that needs amending. Powerful female leaders, with the innovative approaches they can bring, are needed for Web3’s continued evolution. But does the answer to bridging the gap simply lie in providing more funding?</span></p>
<h2><b>Beyond Funding: Self-Empowerment As A Multi-Sided Solution</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partially, yes. But more money for female startups isn’t a complete solution. That’s one-dimensional. All women in Web3, founders or not, can continue to empower themselves in day-to-day approaches.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three main areas to consider are: embracing fear, leveraging existing expertise, and building connections.</span></p>
<h2><b>Embracing the Fear</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology, decentralization, and <a href="http://cryptoslate.com/web3">Web3 ecosystems</a> can be confusing areas to navigate. Nonetheless, acquiring new knowledge should breed excitement alongside any potential fear or doubt. It&#8217;s easy to allow thoughts of “not knowing enough&#8221; and “not being up to speed” take over. This can trigger feelings of inadequacy or overwhelm in a male-dominated industry. But women should embrace their unique ability to learn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a fluid and curious approach, women&#8217;s compassionate abilities often shine through in taking on diverse information. Complexities in understanding should not be feared to the point of freeze or flight. Instead, women must recognize their capabilities and choose to fight through them. Study; ask questions &#8211; with confidence. The more knowledge acquired, the more empowerment comes. The dissolution of boundaries and barriers follow, and the playing field will naturally level out.</span></p>
<h2><b>Leveraging Existing Experience</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Web3 is such a novel, unique space &#8211; it’s easy to slip into the idea that fresh and unique personalities, approaches, and ideas will be the only route to success. Again, doubt can creep in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But women in Web3 need to remind themselves of the wealth of experience, leadership skills, and knowledge they’ve carried over from Web2 industries. Communication counts in Web3. Marketing counts in Web3. Creative arts count in Web3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional financial knowledge counts in Web3. HR counts in Web3. Event management counts in Web3. Gender is irrelevant when it comes to niche professional strengths. Women should constantly be supported to self-advocate for what they can bring from past careers. They must identify and utilize their strengths; this will serve best as they continue learning in conjunction. </span></p>
<h2><b>Building Genuine and Empowering Connections</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideas are the currency of Web3, and creative individuality is the compass. It doesn&#8217;t matter who it is coming from &#8211; so long as direction and purpose are expressed with confidence and conviction. That said, the opportunity to form potential partnerships and connections is abundant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Women in Web3 should consciously sharpen their ability to spot and capitalize on this potential everywhere. It&#8217;s important to recognize and place faith in the mutual respect, collaborative energy, and inclusive environment found in abundance in Web3 communities. It is the cornerstone for the exponential innovation that has occurred in such a short period within the space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Women in Web3 should consciously sharpen their ability to spot and capitalize on this potential everywhere. Strength in unity extends beyond any gender divide, and the more it is nurtured, the easier it gets for everyone.</span></p>
<h2><b>Steering The Ship</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Web3 is progressing in many different verticals, and inclusion must be one of them. Women in Web3 play a crucial role in upholding and nourishing the broader ecosystem. Whether within regulatory landscapes, creative industries, educational reform, or digital asset development, Web3 needs women. Funding is welcomed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; but there is no need to wait for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Females can take the lead and be assured that the community will support and nurture their efforts. Initiative, confidence, and commitment will be the most significant determinants of an improved female influence &#8211; not money.</span></p>
