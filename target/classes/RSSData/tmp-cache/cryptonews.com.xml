										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SOL has jumped by over 6% in the past 24 hours, with <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">the Solana price</a> rising to $186 on a day when the market as a whole has recovered by 3%.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s lift means that SOL is still down by 7.5% in a week, yet it sits on a 25% gain in a fortnight and an 83% increase in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>The coin has also ballooned by 800% in the past year, making it the best-performing top-20 coin of this period.</p>
<p>And with the market looking as though it&#8217;s about to bounce back after a short-term correction, the Solana price could rally considerably in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<h2>Solana Price Prediction as SOL Bounces 6.7% – New Rally Starting?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SOL&#8217;s chart has reached a point where the token is ready for a recovery breakout, with its indicators moving in positive directions.</p>
<p>Its 30-day average (yellow) flipped its 200-day average (blue) this morning, forming a golden cross that often signals stroke rallies to new levels.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s in this context that SOL&#8217;s relative strength index (purple) is also suggesting bullish things, with its level rising from 30 at the end of last week to nearly 70 today.</p>
<p>This suggests strong buying pressure, with a level of 70 allowing for further gains before the coin enters decidedly overbought territory.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s also interesting is that Solana&#8217;s trading volume has risen from $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion in just under 24 hours.</p>
<p>This is potentially a signal that big volume is about to return to the token, with the past few days witnessing several big SOL transfers.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>SOL undoubtedly remains one of the most in-demand alts in the market, which will help the coin push to new heights as it regains its momentum from earlier in the month and from February.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that could help boost the market and, by extension, the Solana price.</p>
<p>These include an improving macroeconomic picture (in particular <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fomc-interest-rate-decision-signals-all-clear-for-bitcoin-bull-run.htm">a softening Federal Reserve</a>), <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/standard-chartered-predicts-up-to-45-billion-inflows-to-ethereum-etfs-within-1-year.htm">hopes of Ethereum ETFs</a>, and the upcoming Bitcoin halving.</p>
<p>Solana will benefit more than many other alts during any market surge, given its strong fundamental position.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Solana meme coins are unbelievable!</p>
<p>My life getting crazy tbh <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/WxLjJBrbZf">pic.twitter.com/WxLjJBrbZf</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinGordon/status/1770513635749568786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Its TVL now <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">stands at $4.4 billion</a>, with its 1,500% increase in the past year following from spikes in NFT and meme coin usage on its network.</p>
<p>Its price could therefore continue to rise steadily in the near future, potentially reaching $200 in a couple of weeks and $250 by the summer.</p>
<h2>Diversification into New Low-Cap Alts</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SOL is undoubtedly one of the major altcoins to watch this year, yet traders can widen their exposure to upside by diversifying their portfolios into smaller cap alts as well as bigger tokens.</p>
<p>There are numerous highly promising new tokens in the market right now, with several presale coins looking particularly good as they prepare to list.</p>
<p><span>For example, </span><a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/greenbitcoin">Green Bitcoin (GBTC) is an ERC-20 token</a> <span>that has raised over $8 million in its sale, which is entering its final stretch.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">With Decentralized and Centralized exchange listings not far away, the momentum Green Bitcoin is generating is getting intense.</p>
<p>We love the movement! <a href="https://t.co/QeOhyUA35f">pic.twitter.com/QeOhyUA35f</a></p>
<p>&mdash; GreenBitcoin (@GreenBTCtoken) <a href="https://twitter.com/GreenBTCtoken/status/1771637913387958733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Styled as an environmentally friendly version of Bitcoin (BTC), Green Bitcoin has the same hard cap of 21 million tokens that has helped to make BTC the biggest cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Yet it adds an environmentally friendly twist on this deflationary formula, in that it operates on the proof-of-stake Ethereum blockchain, which is much less energy intensive.</p>
<p>It also enables staking, meaning that the coin may become even more deflationary than BTC itself, since holders will be locking their tokens up for long periods.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about Green Bitcoin&#8217;s staking model is that it offers a unique predict-to-earn form of staking, which invites stakers to predict future BTC price movements.</p>
<p>If they predict correctly they receive greater rewards, something which should incentivize more staking.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nothing can stop the GREEN REVOLUTION!</p>
<p>Join the Green Bitcoin presale TODAY <a href="https://t.co/YgwUk11Ay8">pic.twitter.com/YgwUk11Ay8</a></p>
<p>&mdash; GreenBitcoin (@GreenBTCtoken) <a href="https://twitter.com/GreenBTCtoken/status/1767252113716097448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>So because of the hard cap and strong staking incentives, the GBTC price could rally substantially and sustainably once it lists.</span></p>
<p><span></span>Investors can buy it as part of the its presale by visiting <a style="font-size: 16px;" href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/greenbitcoin">the official Green Bitcoin website</a>, where 1 GBTC costs $1.1062.</p>
<p>This the final price before the sale ends, so interested traders are advised to act quickly, otherwise they may miss out on one of the biggest launches of 2024.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The charges were filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja and include four counts of tax evasion, encompassing allegations of non-payment of Value-Added Tax (VAT), Company Income Tax, failure to file tax returns, and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through the Binance platform.</span></p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The two detained executives, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, both senior officials at Binance, are currently in custody under the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Nigerian government accuses Binance of neglecting to register with the FIRS for tax purposes and violating tax regulations within the country.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the charges focuses on Binance&#8217;s alleged failure to collect and remit various types of taxes as required by Section 40 of the FIRS Establishment Act 2007.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DigiFT, a Singapore-based fintech company, has made a foray into the digital asset realm with the launch of the its US Treasury bill depository receipt (DR) tokens. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The DR tokens offer investors fractional ownership in the underlying US Treasury bills, enabling investors to gain exposure to the traditionally secure US debt market without the need for substantial upfront capital, the firm </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.digift.sg/announcements/first-rwa-depository-receipt-tokens.html?ref=blockhead.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">said in a Monday press release</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Traditionally, investing in US Treasury bills has required significant financial resources. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DigiFT&#8217;s DR tokens aim to dismantle this barrier by allowing investors to purchase fractional shares of these bills. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;DigiFT&#8217;s innovative DR structure addresses a pain point in the current RWA market, empowering investors with direct ownership of underlying assets and returns,&#8221; Henry Zhang, the founder and CEO of DigiFT, said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He further emphasized DigiFT&#8217;s commitment to expanding the range of traditional financial assets in the Web3 space through the DR model, which offers enhanced investor protection and transparency.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DigiFT Says its DR Tokens Are Regulated</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">One key aspect emphasized by DigiFT is compliance with regulations, providing investors with peace of mind, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Traditional asset ownership often involves navigating complex legal and regulatory frameworks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By adhering to regulations, DigiFT aims to streamline the investment process and make it more accessible for investors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company detailed that the DigiFT US Treasury Tokens (DRUST) is the first offering of a series, under the DR structure. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Each DRUST is directly backed by AA+ rated, highly liquid and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills, tailor-made for stablecoin issuers and Web3 product developer / managers seeking regulatory compliant treasury as well as cash management solutions.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Institutional and accredited investors can access DRUST from their authorised self-custodial wallets using fiat or stablecoins anytime anywhere. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Established in 2021 and previously a participant in the Monetary Authority of Singapore&#8217;s FinTech Regulatory Sandbox, DigiFT obtained the Capital Markets Services (CMS) license and recognition as a Recognized Market Operator (RMO) in December 2023. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tokenized Funds Continue to Gain Popularity</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An industry expert, on Sunday, has ‘debunked’ claims that the European Union has banned anonymous crypto wallets and transactions.</p>
<p>On Saturday, reports spread across the industry, claiming that the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/CJ12/AG/2024/03-19/1297044EN.pdf">EU’s recent anti-money laundering (AML) law</a> specifically targets banning anonymous crypto accounts.</p>
<p>However, industry expert Patrick Hansen addressed these claims, clarifying that the law does not specifically target cryptos.</p>
<p>“Yesterday was a prime example of why crypto Twitter (and often crypto media) should not be trusted when it comes to crypto policy,” he wrote on X (Twitter).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Yesterday was a prime example of why crypto Twitter (and often crypto media) should not be trusted when it comes to crypto policy. Let&#39;s debunk claims that the EU is banning anonymous crypto transactions or self-custodial wallets.</p>
<p>Here is what’s actually in the EU Anti Money… <a href="https://t.co/dsNZQzl9Mx">pic.twitter.com/dsNZQzl9Mx</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) <a href="https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1771929859704389954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote><p>“Let&#8217;s debunk claims that the EU is banning anonymous crypto transactions or self-custodial wallets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He stressed that the law “is not a crypto regulation,” but a broad framework that applies to all financial institutions. These includes CASPs (crypto-asset service providers), as well as services that are prone to AML risks such as gambling services.</p>
<p>“The AMLR will apply to all CASPs (exchanges, brokers etc.) that are regulated under MiCA,” Hansen wrote. “These CASPs will need to follow standard KYC/AML procedures like customer due diligence (CDD) etc.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">4/ The AMLR will apply to all CASPs (exchanges, brokers etc.) that are regulated under MiCA. These CASPs will need to follow standard KYC/AML procedures like customer due diligence (CDD) etc.</p>
<p>This is nothing new, as all crypto exchanges &amp; custodial wallet providers in the EU are… <a href="https://t.co/ZN1AsWdBpw">pic.twitter.com/ZN1AsWdBpw</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) <a href="https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1771929868541767907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Further, on contrary to the rumors regarding an outright ban on anonymous crypto wallets, the AML includes provision for them. According to Hansen, this rule is already included in the existing AML regulation where custodial wallets cannot provide services to anonymous users.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Also, CASPs will not be allowed to provide accounts for privacy coins. This is already existing business practice across the world &#8211; not only in the EU.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/markets-in-crypto-assets-mica-framework-signed-into-law-by-eu-officials.htm">Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation</a>, already prohibits crypto listing with built-in anonymisation function. “As such, this is nothing new either,” he added.</p>
<h2>EU’s AML Law Has Nothing New for Cryptos?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hansen wrote that the regulation largely reaffirms existing AML rules for CASPs. The law poses an &#8220;extremely limited&#8221; impact on the crypto sector in the EU region, he noted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the law has not introduced radically new restrictions on self-custody payments, wallets or peer-to-peer transfers.</p>
<p>“Therefore, you will be able to use your self-custody wallets for buying goods/services in the EU without any restrictions.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2014_2019/plmrep/COMMITTEES/CJ12/AG/2024/03-19/1297044EN.pdf">final text</a> was agreed by the ECON committee in the EU in March and it only needs to pass final approval in the EU Parliament’s plenary and the EU Council.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marathon Digital Holdings CEO Fred Thiel warned that smaller miners will face financial strain following the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/bitcoin-halving/"><span>Bitcoin halving</span></a> event in April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/03/22/large-scale-bitcoin-miners-are-competing-head-on-with-ai-companies-for-power-marathon-digital-ceo.html"><span>In a CNBC interview</span></a> published Friday, Thiel highlighted the disparity in access to capital and equipment financing between smaller and larger miners in the current mining market cycle.</p>
<p>He noted that while larger miners have had the opportunity to raise capital, smaller miners have faced challenges in scaling due to limited access to financing options.</p>
<p>“Post halving I think you&#8217;ll see the smaller miners come under financial stress, which will enable the bigger miners to consolidate the industry,” he said.</p>
<h2>Marathon Digital’s Expansion Strategy in Anticipation of Bitcoin Halving Stress</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
He added that Marathon has prioritized addressing this issue and recently finalized two acquisitions, with intentions to continue acquiring assets in the future.</p>
<p>“We have quite a heavy balance sheet. We’re ready to go as opportunities arise. But you have to be very prudent, you have to do these things at the right prices,” he said.</p>
<p>Marathon recently announced its acquisition of a <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1347/marathon-digital-holdings-enters-definitive-agreement-to"><span>Texas Bitcoin mining facility</span></a> from Applied Digital for about $87m in cash. This facility, situated adjacent to a wind farm, boasts a capacity of 200 megawatts (MW).</p>
<p>In January, the company <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1335/marathon-digital-holdings-enters-definitive-agreement-to"><span>finalized the acquisition</span></a> of two mining facilities located in Texas and Nebraska. This transaction, totaling around $179m, secured 390 MW of mining capacity and involved the termination of competitor Hut 8&#8217;s management of the facilities.</p>
<p>Marathon&#8217;s acquisitions align with its goal of expanding its operations before the upcoming Bitcoin halving, expected around April 20. This event, which occurs every four years, will halve block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Consequently, smaller companies in the sector are expected to face challenges like capital access and high energy expenses.</p>
<h2>Marathon Achieves Record Revenue in 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In 2023, the company <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/marathon-digital-reports-record-387-5-million-revenue-in-2023.htm"><span>experienced a surge in revenue</span></a>, culminating in substantial profitability. Its fourth quarter and annual earnings report unveiled record-breaking revenue of $387.5m for the year, marking a 229% increase compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>“2023 was a record-breaking year for Marathon, during which we achieved our primary objectives of energizing our fleet of previously purchased mining rigs and optimizing our performance,” Thiel said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Decentralized finance aggregator ParaSwap has addressed a critical vulnerability in its recently launched Augustus v6 smart contract and has commenced the process of returning cryptocurrency assets to affected users. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, permissions to the Augustus v6 contract have been revoked to prevent further exploitation.</span></p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the majority of users have had their assets returned, ParaSwap has identified 213 addresses that have yet to revoke allowances to the flawed contract. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Revoking allowances involves disabling or terminating the contract&#8217;s functionality on the blockchain, ensuring it no longer has access to users&#8217; wallets and tokens.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If your wallet &#8220;have not received them yet, your wallet is still vulnerable, PLEASE REVOKE ALL RELEVANT PERMISSIONS!&#8221; they wrote. </span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The vulnerability in the newly launched smart contract was discovered by ParaSwap last week. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Thanks to the timely intervention of white hat hackers, a significant loss of assets was prevented. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The platform promptly took action by submitting a comprehensive report to the appropriate authorities, initiating an investigation into the stolen funds.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ParaSwap is working closely with blockchain analytics and security firms, Chainalysis and TRM Labs, in an effort to identify the hacker addresses and trace the movement of the funds. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The team has also reached out to the identified hacker addresses through on-chain messaging, urging the return of the stolen user funds.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the hacker fails to respond by March 27, ParaSwap will assume that the funds have been unlawfully appropriated, and they will pursue all available legal avenues to recover them.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Initially, the losses incurred were relatively small, with preliminary findings indicating that the hackers managed to abscond with only $24,000 before the vulnerability was discovered.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The vulnerability was detected in ParaSwap&#8217;s Augustus v6 smart contract on March 20, just days after its launch on March 18.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> The contract aimed to enhance token swaps and reduce transfer fees. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upon discovering the vulnerability, ParaSwap promptly paused the application programming interface (API) and secured the funds through the assistance of white hat hackers.</span></p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hacks and exploits have become a mounting concern in the crypto industry, particularly within the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In individual incidents, hacking accounted for over $65 million (97.54%) of the stolen funds in February 2024.</span></p>

<p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/goldman-sachs-hedge-fund-spike-crypto-options-engagement.htm">Goldman Sachs Sees Spike in Crypto Options Engagement Among Hedge Funds</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Goldman Sachs&#8217; hedge fund clients are reportedly showing increased interest in crypto derivatives, spurred by the resurgence of the crypto market.</p>
<p>The bank officially launched its crypto trading desk in 2021. It then began to facilitate various <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/"><span>Bitcoin</span></a>-linked trades, including Bitcoin non-deliverable futures and CME BTC futures, following years of contemplation dating back to 2017.</p>
<p>Currently, Goldman offers cash-settled Bitcoin and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/"><span>Ether</span></a> option trading, alongside CME-listed Bitcoin and Ether futures. However, it does not directly trade the actual underlying crypto tokens themselves.</p>
<p>Max Minton, Goldman’s Asia Pacific head of digital assets, told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-24/goldman-s-hedge-fund-clients-get-more-active-in-crypto-options"><span>Bloomberg in a recent interview</span></a> that the recent approval of ETFs has reignited interest and activity among the bank&#8217;s clients. Minton noted that many clients are either currently active in the crypto space or are considering entering it.</p>
<h2>Goldman Sachs Clients Embrace Crypto Derivatives for Diverse Purposes</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to Minton, there has been a noticeable increase in client interest, onboarding, pipeline, and trading volume since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>A majority of this demand stems from Goldman&#8217;s existing clients, particularly traditional hedge funds. However, the bank is also broadening its client base to include asset managers, banking clients, and specific digital asset firms.</p>
<p>He mentioned that clients are using crypto derivatives for various purposes, such as directional bets, yield enhancement, and hedging.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETF Launch Sparks Market Optimism</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The development follows Bitcoin&#8217;s recent surge to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-record-high-72k-signals-strong-crypto-rebound.htm"><span>record high above $72,000</span></a>, triggered by the Bitcoin ETF launch and anticipation around the upcoming halving event.</p>
<p>Despite Bitcoin retracing to around $67,075 as of Monday, the outlook for crypto derivatives remains bullish. A quarterly report from Genesis Trading last year <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/genesis-report-crypto-derivatives-emerge-as-next-key-growth-driver-2023.htm"><span>predicted substantial expansion in this sector</span></a>, driven by a significant decrease in spot market liquidity and a growing trend towards the use of derivative instruments.</p>
<p>Currently, most Goldman clients appear to be primarily focused on Bitcoin-related products. However, there is potential for a shift in interest towards Ether-related products if Ether ETFs receive approval in the US.</p>
<p>Mathew McDermott, Goldman&#8217;s head of digital assets, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-ether-etf-goldman-sachs-sec-approval-confident.htm"><span>expressed optimism</span></a> about the approval of Ether ETFs back in January.</p>
<p>The SEC is expected to make its initial ruling on a spot Ethereum ETF by May 23.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon was released from prison in Montenegro on Saturday as the Supreme Court deliberates on extradition requests from the U.S. and South Korea, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-23/crypto-fugitive-do-kwon-out-of-jail-but-his-next-destination-is-unclear?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg report</a> citing prison officials.</span></p>
<p><span>Kwon’s recent ruling mandating his extradition to South Korea is being challenged by Montenegro’s top prosecutor. </span>Last week it emerged the<span> </span><span><a href="https://sudovi-me.translate.goog/vrdt/sadrzaj/W8V9?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office in Montenegro</a> is escalating the case to the </span><span>Supreme Court for review claiming errors were made. </span></p>
<p><span>Do Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 after being caught using a fake Costa Rican passport traveling to Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;We released Do Kwon from prison as his regular prison term for traveling with fake papers ended,” Montenegro prison director Darko Vukcevic told the news outlet. “Since he is a foreign citizen and his documents were withheld, he was taken for an interview to police directorate for foreigners, and they will deal with him further,&#8221; said Vukcevic.</span></p>
<p><span>Both </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/do-kwon-should-be-extradited-to-south-korea-not-united-states-lawyer-argues.htm">South Korea and the U.S. had appealed</a><span> to extradite Kwon, however, Montenegro’s minister of justice gave preference to South Korea. This decision is being challenged by Montenegro’s top prosecutor.  </span></p>
<h2>Do Kwon’s Arrest and Terra’s Collapse</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span></span>Do Kwon is the architect behind the failed crypto project<span> </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terrausd-stablecoin-scandal-sec-sues-terraform-labs-do-kwon-for-deceiving-investors-heres-what-happened.htm">TerraUSD stablecoin,</a><span> </span>launched in 2022. As a stablecoin designed to be a utility token on the blockchain, Terra USD was pegged algorithmically 1:1 to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The stablecoin lost its pegging, however, resulting in its collapse alongside LUNA, the Terra sister token. The United States and South Korean authorities went after Kwon, who escaped to<span> </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/terraform-officials-banned-from-leaving-south-korea-as-do-kwon-may-apply-for-singaporean-citizenship.htm">Singapore to avoid South Korean prosecutors</a><span> </span>from opening his fraud charges.</p>
<p>Kwon was later apprehended in Montenegro and sentenced to four months imprisonment after he was caught trying to escape using a forged Costa Rican passport.</p>
<p>As it stands, South Korean authorities are escalating efforts to ensure Kwon faces prosecution for his alleged fraud cases and tax evasion.</p>
<p>Kwon, who denied the charges, claimed that the $40 billion implosion of the Terra ecosystem resulted from market forces and doesn’t indicate any criminal action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russian Ministry of Finance says it wants to settle its long-standing crypto policy differences with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-government-to-create-crypto-confiscation-platform.htm">nation</a>’s Central Bank.</p>
<p>According to the media outlet <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/crypto/news/65fd7cc69a7947fb94c51d1c">RBC</a>, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said he was “sure” his ministry and the bank would soon “come to an agreement” on crypto regulation-related matters.</p>
<h2>Russian Central Bank Eager to Break Crypto Impasse?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Speaking at an event held at a state-run financial university, Siluanov said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am sure that [the ministry] and the Central Bank will come to an agreement. This issue has been discussed for several years. We cannot prohibit the circulation of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, we need to regulate this [market]. I am sure that we will find a solution.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have been locked in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-central-bank-still-saying-no-use-of-crypto-settlements.htm">an unproductive crypto policy-related impasse</a> for years.</p>
<p>The government agency wants to regulate and tax crypto exchanges and traders, but the bank has previously called for a China-style blanket ban.</p>
<p>The ministry tried to break through this impasse in early 2022, when it unveiled a comprehensive draft bill on crypto regulation.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The bank shot back with its own rival bill, proposing an almost total ban on all crypto-related activities.</p>
<p>Neither bill made it past the committee stage at the State Duma, and the crypto sector has remained in limbo ever since.</p>
<p>This led to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russia-fatf-rating-downgraded-due-to-insufficient-crypto-regulation.htm">a downgrading in the nation’s FATF compliance rating last month</a>, and calls from government bodies to fast-track regulation.</p>
<p>However, the war in Ukraine and resulting Western <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-firms-already-doing-business-crypto-say-theyve-every-right-do-so.htm">sanctions</a> appear to have forced the Russian Central Bank’s hand.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The bank has grudgingly conceded to soften its stance on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-crypto-miners-tell-lawmakers-hurry-up-legalize-our-industry.htm">industrial crypto mining</a>, which is now booming in Russia.</p>
<p>It has also agreed to make some concessions on the use of crypto as a payment tool in international trade.</p>
<p>And it is here that Siluanov sees common ground for legislation. He said there was a “need to work together with the Central Bank on the issue of identifying possible options for using cryptocurrencies for settlements, both within the country and abroad.”</p>

<h2>Russian Crypto Mining Industry Booms – Will Bank Make Concessions?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The minister also claimed that the bank had “agreed to hold a meeting to discuss [crypto] mining.” He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We need to talk about what can and cannot be done with cryptocurrency. We have now agreed, with the Central Bank, to discuss the issue of mining. We must talk about whether [mined coins] can be used to make settlements within the country and in international settlements.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the bank is unlikely to make such sweeping concessions. The bank’s long-serving Governor Elvira Nabiullina has repeatedly stated that she will not tolerate crypto’s “entry into the Russian economy.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Siluanov admitted that both the ministry and the bank were “inclined” to ensure that mined tokens were used “for external payments.”</p>
<p>Such talk could <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-lawmakers-want-to-create-a-state-run-crypto-exchange.htm">resurrect plans to create a state-owned crypto exchange</a> that essentially buys Russian miners’ coins and sells them to firms that pay for overseas goods in crypto.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Russian Mining Tax Windfall on the Cards?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Russian crypto miners have said legalizing their industry could provide the state with a $540.3 million windfall in tax revenue.</p>
<p>Industry chiefs have <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-crypto-mining-industry-could-be-set-for-4bn-boost.htm">claimed they are ready to invest $4 billion</a> in new multi-purpose data centers, which could also save Moscow $32.4 million in tech investment.</p>
<p>Miners have become frustrated at Moscow’s refusal to legalize their industry, instead leaving it in a quasi-legal grey zone.</p>
<p>Crypto mining is neither legal nor illegal in Russia, a fact that has led to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-crypto-mining-hotspot-cracks-down-on-illegal-miners.htm">much legal frustration in the nation</a>.</p>
<p>They have <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-crypto-miners-fume-at-moscows-plans-to-raise-their-electricity-tariffs.htm">also hit back</a> at the Ministry of Energy’s controversial plans to hike their electricity tariffs by up to five times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The South Korean exchange Bithumb is looking to step up its IPO plans – and could look to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-crypto-exchange-bithumb-still-aiming-for-ipo-despite-deep-troubles.htm">launch a fast-tracked initial public offering</a> as the crypto bull market continues.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.hankyung.com/article/202403220305O" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hanguk Kyungjae</a>, Bithumb is looking to “accelerate” its proposed KOSPI listing.</p>
<h2>Bithumb IPO: Exchange Takes Decisive Steps</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The media outlet reported that Bithumb announced that the exchange will spin off its holdings operations into a separate company. It is tentatively naming this firm Bithumb Investment.</p>
<p>The firm published a regulatory filing document on March 22 detailing its plans.</p>
<p>The new firm will take control of Bithumb’s holdings, investments, and real estate operations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the entity currently known as Bithumb Korea will focus on operating the crypto trading platform.</p>
<p>The company plans to divide shares in Bithumb using a 6:4 ratio. It will put the plan before a meeting of shareholders on May 10.</p>
<p>If the shareholders approve, Bithumb Investment will officially launch on June 13, the media outlet reported.</p>
<p>Shareholders will reportedly be told they will “receive new shares in the new corporation in proportion to their existing shares.”</p>
<p>The firm made no mention of ongoing court cases, including <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-prosecutors-seek-arrest-warrants-for-golf-star-bithumb-exec.htm">a probe into alleged market manipulation supposedly conducted by the mysterious “real” owner of Bithumb</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, it appears the firm wants to distance itself from such matters. It seems to want the IPO’s success or otherwise to stem from its core exchange business.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2>Could Bithumb Bring Forward its Listing Plans?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Bithumb-related business has <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-crypto-exchange-bithumb-reinstates-commission-fees-after-four-months.htm">boomed in recent months</a>. The firm was, until recently, offering commission-free trading in a bid to claw back market share from its biggest rival Upbit.</p>
<p>A retail <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> trading <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kimchi-premium-returns-bitcoin-trades-at-10-price-premium-in-south-korea-against-global-exchanges.htm">renaissance</a> has also seen trading volumes rise in South Korea. The nation is famously crypto-keen. But it has a tiny pool of platforms that have fiat-crypto trading licenses.</p>
<figure id="attachment_188145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188145" style="width: 1804px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-188145" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24110329/1711278209-bithumb-2403.png" alt="A graph showing trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past 12 months." width="1804" height="591" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24110329/1711278209-bithumb-2403.png 1804w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24110329/1711278209-bithumb-2403-300x98.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24110329/1711278209-bithumb-2403-1024x335.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24110329/1711278209-bithumb-2403-768x252.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24110329/1711278209-bithumb-2403-1536x503.png 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/24110329/1711278209-bithumb-2403-150x49.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1804px) 100vw, 1804px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-188145" class="wp-caption-text">Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The exchange hopes that the spinoff will “further increase the possibility of IPO launch” by creating an entity that is “centered on the exchange business,” the media outlet noted. It added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“New businesses outside core exchange operations will be pursued with speed through new corporations – without being restricted by the Bithumb IPO bid.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A Bithumb spokesperson said the move would “promote efficiency.” The official added that it would also “boost the growth” of “exchange operations” with “separate ownership” models.</p>
<p>Bithumb has previously said it is eyeing a 2025 KOSPI debut. The new move could potentially see the exchange fast-track its listing.</p>
<p>Regardless of the timing, however, the exchange is likely to win its bid to become the first South Korean trading platform to go public.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Friend.tech, a social platform leveraging Web3 technology, has proposed a new ownership model by </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65ff51ecd6931a6575152ed4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">offering its shares to its</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> users. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The move is intended to empower platform users, who were previously mere participants, to become investors with a vested interest in the company&#8217;s prosperity. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This shift reflects a broader transformation in investment dynamics towards democratization within the digital realm.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Friend.tech Users Become Investors</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Friend.tech users will now transition from being solely content creators or consumers to becoming actual investors in the platform. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The move strengthens the bond between users and the company, fostering a stronger sense of community.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This initiative was made possible through an agreement with previous shareholders, including Paradigm, who have consented to transfer the rights of selling tokens directly to the platform&#8217;s users.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By enabling this transfer, Friend.tech takes a significant step towards a user-centric model, where users not only shape the platform&#8217;s future but also share in its success.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The shift by Friend.tech opens up new avenues for user engagement and investment within the crypto industry. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By providing users with ownership stakes and control over tokens, the company advocates for a more inclusive and equitable approach to technology entrepreneurship and governance. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The move challenges the status quo of venture capital financing and signals a shift towards broader user participation and investment. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Users are now empowered to directly impact the platform&#8217;s trajectory, fostering a cooperative culture.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is also important to note that Paradigm played a key role in the move. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Known for investing in innovative technology ventures, the crypto VC agreed to distribute shares among users, signaling a rise in more decentralized and user-focused business models.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Friend.tech’s Popularity Drops After Splashy Debut</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Friend.tech, launched on August 10, 2023, has become one of the top decentralized applications (dApps) on the Base layer, attracting over 200,000 users and facilitating a trading volume exceeding $230 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The platform uniquely converts user influence into tradable tokens known as “keys,” allowing users to gain access to a creator’s attention or influence.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The model has attracted not only cryptocurrency influencers but also NBA players and esports personalities, broadening its appeal beyond the crypto space.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One significant factor contributing to Friend.tech’s popularity was the hype surrounding the Base network, a Layer 2 solution associated with Coinbase.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The involvement of Paradigm, an investment firm connected to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/reviews/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, further increased confidence in Friend.tech’s potential.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the platform has also faced privacy concerns, particularly regarding the potential for user doxxing due to the link between Twitter profiles and Ethereum addresses.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Friend.tech has addressed these concerns by clarifying that the information deemed leaked was actually from their public API, showcasing the platform’s open nature while also highlighting the importance of user caution in protecting personal information.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nevertheless, Friend.tech has seen its popularity drop as of late.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://dune.com/tk-research/friendtech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dune analytics dashboard</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the project raked in more than $1 million in revenue at its peak last year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, its revenue has recently fallen to under $15,000 over the past couple of months.</span></p>

<p><i><span>Sunday, March 24th, 2024</span></i><span> –  Solana meme coin $PUNDU has closed out its presale with a whopping $37 million raise, but Dogecoin20 is still open, and contributors are pushing its presale towards a $10 million hard cap sellout.</span></p>
<p><span>At the time of writing </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20"><span>Dogecoin20</span></a><span> ($DOGE20) – an upgraded better version of Dogecoin – has amassed more than $7.6 million from investors in barely a week as meme coin fever continues. </span></p>
<p><span>Luckily for those arriving late at the party or may have missed $PUNDU, the creators of $DOGE20 have extended the presale. </span></p>
<p><span>Nevertheless, given the hype and FOMO developing around the token, the initial coin offering is highly likely to sell out early this week given its past fundraising performance, so buyers need to move fast.</span></p>
<p><span>Dogecoin20 is bringing $DOGE to the Ethereum blockchain and dispensing with the inflationary supply that could hold it back in the future and the computationally expensive mining system the coin still uses. </span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>Ethereum is still the No.1 blockchain for decentralized applications and its recent Dencun software revamp has been a roaring success that is already reducing the transaction fees from Layer 2s like Polygon and Optimism. </span></p>
<p><span>All of this makes Dogecoin20 token even more attractive because it is built on a future-proof architecture that is constantly improving.</span></p>
<h2><span>Dogecoin price is up 7% today as its march higher continues… and Dogecoin20 is coming up fast in its slipstream</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Meanwhile, the world’s best-known and most valuable meme coin, Dogecoin, sees its price maintain an upward trajectory despite consolidation in the crowded bitcoin trade.</span></p>
<p><span>$DOGE is 7% higher at the beginning of the European session on Sunday, priced at $0.1733.</span></p>
<p><span>Dogecoin20 is currently $0.000208 priced at $0.000164 in what is now the 14th stage of the presale price ladder. Such has been the demand for the </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20"><span>$DOGE20</span></a><span> token that the presale has been extended, with the hard cap target moved out to $10 million so that the voracious appetite of legions of buyers can be satisfied.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dogecoin20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Dogecoin20</a> embodies the lively spirit of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Memecoins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Memecoins</a>, captivating the imagination of the crypto world. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1fa90.png" alt="🪐" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Marrying memes with on-chain staking, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dogecoin20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Dogecoin20</a> charts its own distinctive course, attracting a diverse array of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Crypto</a> fans. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png" alt="🔗" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/vizZbyFKKq">pic.twitter.com/vizZbyFKKq</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>But with the Dogecoin20 presale run rate regularly exceeding more than half a million dollars per day, prospective contributors will need to move in a spritely fashion to secure the lowest available prices. </span></p>
<p><span>Stage 14 ends either in two days or when the target of $8,183,163 is reached, whichever comes first. The previous hard cap total was </span><span>$6,315,663</span><span> but has now been updated to $10,068,663. </span></p>
<h2><span>On-chain staking passive income means Dogecoin20 is better than Dogecoin  </span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>You get more woof with </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20"><span>$DOGE20</span></a><span> – it has the foundation to build a meme coin like nothing that has come before in the Shiba Inu-inspired token world, thanks to its built-in on-chain staking feature.</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike Dogecoin, this upgraded version deploys Ethereum smart contracts to underpin the mechanics of what is a passive income vehicle, where stakers of $DOGE20 are rewarded with an income stream denominated in $DOGE20. </span></p>
<p><span>You can start staking as soon as you buy in the presale. Estimated rewards are currently 132$ per annum and more than 21 billion $DOGE20 tokens have been staked.</span></p>

<h2><span>$DOGE20 fixes the $DOGE inflation problem and is attracting big Chinese money</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Another aspect to the improvements that Dogecoin20 is bringing is the problem of the infinite supply of Dogecoin. $DOGE20 fixes this emissions problem by introducing a fixed supply of 140,000,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span>Much of the new money flowing into crypto is coming from China and </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20"><span>Dogecoin20</span></a><span> with its ‘best Doge upgrade’ appeal is attracting substantial funding from that quarter, along with Pundu and another coin called $PUMP. </span></p>
<p><span>In what could be among the biggest presales ever, $PUMP, which is a BNB Smart Chain coin with a massive Chinese following, has raised $280 million.  </span></p>
<p><span>Whichever chain meme coins are launching on, then, there is a more than ample supply of willing buyers from China and elsewhere – providing a coin can demonstrate it has the potential to hit the mark in the virality stakes, as Dogecoin20 does.</span></p>
<h2><span>Top finance news sites and YouTube crypto are excited about $DOGE20</span></h2>

<p><span>Elsewhere, Youtuber Matthew Perry has been letting his 217k subscribers know all about Dogecoin20, going as far as to say it is better than $DOGE. </span></p>
<p><span>Without a doubt, Dogecoin is still the king of the meme coins and the one to watch. It is this brand power that makes Dogecoin20’s focus on bettering ‘the Doge’ such an investible opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span>Those who snapped up Dogecoin at its all-time low in May 2015 and held it until today are sitting on gains of 202,045%, according to Coinmarketcap data. With that sort of ROI on the table in the meme coins sector, the sky’s the limit for Dogecoin20. The $DOGE20 price could 100x at launch. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20"><span>$DOGE20</span></a><span> can be bought with ETH, USDT, BNB or with fiat using a card. Sign up to the Dogecoin20 community on its </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DOGE_COIN20"><span>X/Twitter</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://t.me/DOGE_COIN20"><span>Telegram</span></a><span> channels.</span></p>

<p>The presale drew an extensive commitment from BNB Chain&#8217;s prominent cryptocurrency holders, amassing 363,000 BNB, 9 million CAKE, 24 million BAKE, 1.5 trillion 1CAT, and 73 trillion IQ50, reflecting a blend of confidence and speculative interest in PUMP&#8217;s potential market impact.</p>
<h2><strong>PUMP&#8217;s Intriguing Appeal in the Crypto Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Defined by BakerySwap as a meme coin devoid of utility, PUMP embodies the quintessential crypto dream: significant asset appreciation.</p>
<p>Despite its speculative nature and lack of a development team, PUMP&#8217;s launch parallels the early days of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, which evolved from a joke to a major cryptocurrency with a $21.3 billion market cap.</p>
<p>This trajectory underscores the speculative and community-driven aspects that often fuel meme coins&#8217; popularity and success.</p>
<h2><strong>Speculative Surge or Ephemeral Hype? The PUMP Dilemma</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As PUMP navigates the volatile crypto market, its future hinges on the community&#8217;s sentiment and speculative investment trends.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bakery_swap/status/1771122074976923753">BakerySwap&#8217;s recent tweets</a> confirm the completion of the PUMP presale and the upcoming start of trading, sparking widespread anticipation for its market performance.</p>
<p>The significant presale participation and the sheer volume of committed assets indicate a potent mix of confidence and speculative interest in PUMP&#8217;s journey on the BNB Chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Emin Gün Sirer, the co-founder of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/avax-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> blockchain, has sounded the alarm on deceptive trends infiltrating certain layer-2 (L2) solutions, posing risks to investors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1771658050228617428?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent post on X</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Sirer expressed concerns about these &#8220;trash&#8221; projects while educating users about their common characteristics and red flags.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sirer believes that the rise of substandard L2 projects represents the next significant hazard in the crypto ecosystem, following the infamous crypto exchange heist orchestrated by former FTX founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Trash&#8221; L2 Projects Flood the Market</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The renowned crypto figure argues that the launch procedures for L2 solutions are relatively lax, allowing bad actors to create projects with little to no value.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To safeguard investor security, Sirer outlined several warning signs associated with these risky L2 solutions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firstly, he noted a discrepancy between the project&#8217;s narrative and its underlying technology, indicating a misalignment between marketing claims and technical implementation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For instance, projects with centralized sequencers and no fraud-proof mechanisms contradict the core principles of decentralization and security in the cryptocurrency realm.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sirer also highlighted L2 solutions that conduct token sales primarily for fundraising purposes, rather than having a specific, practical use on the network. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Such projects raise suspicions of dubious investments. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Moreover, Sirer cautioned against L2 projects in which founders sell their personal native tokens before the project&#8217;s launch, considering it a significant red flag.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey y&#39;all,</p>
<p>We all ignored the huge red flags associated with SBF because &quot;he looked smart&quot; and &quot;he made a lot of money.&quot; Then it turned out that he was dumb as rocks, was a sociopath, and was just stealing our money.</p>
<p>The next cycle is going to be even more noisy, with even…</p>
<p>&mdash; Emin Gün Sirer<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f53a.png" alt="🔺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@el33th4xor) <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1771658050228617428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Issue of Low-Float Tokens within L2s</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another concern raised by Sirer is the prevalence of low-float tokens within projects, which can artificially inflate token values through manipulative tactics, similar to those employed by SBF. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lastly, Sirer advised investors to pay attention to the moral conduct and habits of project founders, as any signs of personal misconduct should be considered during the evaluation process.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to the mentioned red flags, Sirer proposed a simple test to help investors navigate the vast number of L2 projects being launched daily and identify authentic and profitable ventures. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He suggested identifying the main issues, or &#8220;blockers,&#8221; in the crypto space at any given time. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For example, scalability and performance were significant concerns until solutions emerged from blockchains like Avalanche and Solana.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sirer believes that supporting multiple use cases on the same platform and integrating with traditional finance (TradFi) are currently critical challenges facing the crypto ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before investing in an L2 solution, Sirer advises users to assess whether the project genuinely addresses these challenges.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem has experienced substantial expansion over the past year and a half, with a total value locked (TVL) surpassing $27 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In October 2023, transaction activity on Layer 2 networks exceeded that of the Ethereum mainnet, with these networks now routinely processing five times as many transactions, according to L2beat.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As reported, Ethereum-based layer 2 network Arbitrum now </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-dominates-with-nearly-50-of-ethereum-layer-2-total-value-locked.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has a market share of 49.17%</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> among layer 2 networks, far surpassing number two on the list, Optimism Mainnet, with its 28.85% market share.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The network has also seen a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrums-total-value-locked-surges-past-2-5-billion-as-token-nears-2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">consistent increase in its TVL</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> at least since October last year, rising about 50% from $1.66 billion in October to the current value of $2.51 billion, data from DeFi tracking site DefiLlama showed.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has criticized crypto industry participants for avoiding registration requirements with the regulator.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> In his closing remarks during a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-columbia-law-school-032224" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">speech at Columbia Law School</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Gensler emphasized the importance of mandatory disclosure for market participants, referring to Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis&#8217; statement that &#8220;Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gensler expressed concern over certain participants in the crypto securities markets seeking to evade registration requirements, which results in a lack of mandatory disclosure. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He highlighted the need for transparency in the crypto markets, suggesting that some disinfectant measures could benefit the industry. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gary Gensler Wages War Against Crypto Companies</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the past year, the SEC has filed numerous lawsuits against crypto firms, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler consistently asserting that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For one, the agency initiated a civil case </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-and-cftcs-lawsuits-against-sam-bankman-fried-put-on-hold-by-us-judge-heres-why.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">against Sam Bankman-Fried</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, co-founder of FTX. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to the case against Bankman-Fried, the SEC filed lawsuits against other major crypto players, including </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance, its CEO Changpeng Zhao</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-coinbase-sues-sec-demands-court-compel-response-rulemaking-petition-heres-latest.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Many industry players and advocacy groups have called on the SEC to establish clear regulatory guidelines to foster innovation within the United States.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC has reportedly issued subpoenas as part of its campaign to potentially </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-reportedly-probing-key-crypto-companies-in-push-to-make-eth-a-security-fortune.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">classify Ethereum (ETH) as a security</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> under its regulatory purview. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“[T]here still are those who would like to whittle away at the SEC’s disclosure regime,” said the SEC chair. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“There are participants in crypto securities markets that seek to avoid these registration requirements. No registration means no mandatory disclosure. Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In recent years, the SEC has made progress in approving crypto-related exchange-traded products for U.S. exchanges, including investment vehicles tied to ETH and Bitcoin futures, along with the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SEC Postpones Decision on Futures ETH ETF</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a separate development, the SEC has once again extended the deadline to decide on the approval of Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum Futures Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2024/34-99842.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced that the previous deadline</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of March 31 will be postponed to May 30. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ETF proposed by digital asset management firm Grayscale aims to invest in Ethereum futures contracts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC&#8217;s decision to extend the deadline follows its earlier postponement in December 2023, during which it sought additional public input on whether the ETF should be listed. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Grayscale had proposed listing and trading shares of its Ethereum Futures Trust ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E in September 2023. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that Grayscale might be using its futures ETF application as a strategic move to influence the SEC&#8217;s decision on approving its spot Ether ETF. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the SEC were to approve Grayscale&#8217;s futures ETF, it could strengthen Grayscale&#8217;s argument for the approval of its spot Ether ETF application.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the SEC has also delayed its decision on whether to approve Grayscale&#8217;s spot Ether ETF, opening the application to public comments on January 25. </span></p>

<p><span>With Cathie Wood reiterating a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction/#:~:text=As%20more%20and%20more%20people,by%20the%20end%20of%202025.">Bitcoin price prediction</a> of $1.5 million, the crypto market, including Solana, faces a transformative phase, underscored by increased institutional interest and bullish forecasts. </span></p>

Cathie Wood, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/cathie-woods-ark-invest-offloads-27-million-worth-of-coin.htm">CEO of Ark Invest</a>, recently hailed Bitcoin as a pivotal financial tool, particularly for emerging markets facing currency depreciation, like Nigeria.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Set to be sentenced next week, disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is facing charges that carry a total maximum penalty of over 100 years in prison &#8211; but what sentence will he actually get?</span></p>
<p><span>In the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-court-documents-reveal-sam-bankman-frieds-strategies-to-repair-public-image.htm">defense’s sentencing recommendation</a> released late last month, Bankman-Fried’s camp pushed for a maximum prison sentence of just over six years, citing his age and “genuine concern” about other people.</span></p>
<h3>SBF Facing What Could Amount To A Life Sentence</h3>
<p><span>In their own sentencing recommendation released shortly thereafter, prosecutors argued that a six-year sentence </span><span>would be “woefully inaccurate” and “send the wrong message to the defendant, to others considering committing fraud, to victims, and to society at large,” recommending a prison term of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/cryptocurrency-scams.htm">40 to 50 years for the FTX fraudster</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>“Bankman-Fried’s crimes were serious and long-running, causing billions of dollars in losses and significant harm to tens of thousands of victims financially and emotionally,” prosecutors argued. “The sheer enormity of the loss in this case, and the fact that the loss came in the form of stealing of victims’ money, puts Bankman-Fried in a category of defendants where sentences of forty years or more is appropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span>Former U.S. Assistant Attorney and white-collar crime expert Kevin J. O&#8217;Brien thinks neither of those sentences is likely given that the presiding judge is Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, however.</span></p>
<p><span>“Kaplan’s tough &#8211; and he has that reputation &#8211; but he’s not nasty,” O’Brien said in an interview with Cryptonews. “I don’t think he’s effectively going to put the guy away for the rest of his adult life. He’s going to give him an opportunity to make amends and live a meaningful life outside of prison.”</span></p>
<h2>Is The Defense&#8217;s Argument Too Good To Be True?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>In their sentencing recommendation, the defense attempted to compare Bankman-Fried to “junk bond king” turned philanthropist Michael Milken and Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, who received 11 and seven years in prison, respectively.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry, but this is psychotic. I get that Sam Bankman-Fried is wildly unsympathetic. But there is no sane reason taxpayers need to keep him locked in a cage until he’s in his 80s. We are totally desensitized to excessively long prison terms in this country. <a href="https://t.co/5BHW7lCTDX">https://t.co/5BHW7lCTDX</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Billy Binion (@billybinion) <a href="https://twitter.com/billybinion/status/1768729318383829112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>O’Brien is unsure whether those comparisons will necessarily work in the eyes of the law, however.</span></p>
<p><span>“Those are smart arguments but there are differences between his case and those cases,” </span><span>said O’Brien, noting that the “size of the damage was much higher in his case.”</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, O’Brien pointed out that Milken’s “good works” only occurred after his “exit from prison.”</span></p>
<p><span>“It’s kind of hard for Bankman-Fried to try to bank on that before he’s even sentenced,” O’Brien continued.</span></p>
<h2>Judge Kaplan Will Do What He Thinks Is Right, O&#8217;Brien Says</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>O’Brien’s comments come amid the March 20 appointment of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/unabomber-prosecutor-to-conduct-ftx-probe-into-law-firm-sullivan-and-cromwells-conflicts-of-interest.htm">Unabomber prosecutor Robert J. Cleary</a> by a U.S. bankruptcy judge to probe into the collapse of FTX and its potential conflicts of interest with law firm Sullivan and Cromwell. </span></p>
<p><span>Current <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-to-face-independent-investigation-federal-appeals-court-rules.htm">FTX CEO John J. Ray III</a> has vocally opposed the approval of an independent examiner, citing current management’s independence from the FTX fraudsters.</span></p>
<p><span>“There’s a certain amount of politics here because of the responsibility of management for this mess,” O’Brien said of the legal saga, calling it “very much an issue.”</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/about/overview/Overview_Federal_Sentencing_Guidelines.pdf">the parties’ sentencing recommendations</a>, Kaplan will have to follow the U.S. government’s federal sentencing guidelines. If he gives Bankman-Fried a sentence that is too much lower than the recommended punishment, the government could appeal his decision.</span></p>
<p><span>“Of course, Kaplan probably doesn’t care,” O’Brien said. “He’s going to do what he thinks is right.”</span></p>
<p><span>When asked how long Bankman-Fried&#8217;s sentence could be, O’Brien claimed he could see the former “king of crypto” land up to two decades in prison.</span></p>
<p><span>“I wouldn’t be surprised if Sam Bankman-Fried got 15 years,” he estimated.</span></p>
<p><span>The FTX founder is currently being held at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. His sentencing is scheduled for March 28 in Manhattan.</span></p>
<p><span>Investigative findings from Cleary’s independent examination are due back in court within 60 days.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the Shiba Inu price consolidates near $0.26, not too far below the recent multi-year highs it hit earlier this month, Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are pivoting to the latest ICO called Dogwifcat ($DWIFC) in search of 1000x returns.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu’s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/">market cap is $15.59 billion</a>, making it a strong contender for king of meme coins.</p>
<p>However, its high market cap raises concerns that the room for further upside might be limited.</p>
<p>No matter the Shiba Inu community’s efforts to build out the token’s utility, can a meme coin command a market cap of more than $50 billion?</p>
<p>Some fear that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/shiba-inu-price-prediction/">Shiba Inu’s</a> upside prospects may be limited to a maximum of 5x or less.</p>
<p>And in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> sector, traders tend to look down their noses at the prospect of 5x gains.</p>
<p>Meme coin traders often prefer targeting coins that offer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/which-crypto-100x-potential-year.htm">potential gains in the region of 100x</a> or more.</p>
<p>One such coin they are likely taking a look is the latest ICO called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogwifcat">Dogwifcat</a> ($DWIFC).</p>
<h2><strong>Latest ICO Dogwifcat ($DWIFC) Starts Life With a Bang</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The newest Solana meme coin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogwifcat">DogWifCat ($DWIFC)</a> launched earlier this week and has already soared 4,268% to $0.017 as frenzied buying accelerates.</p>

<p>Aside from bitcoin chalking up new all-time highs, the biggest story in crypto is the Solana juggernaut.</p>
<p>First, there was BONK then Dogwifhat, and more recently $SMOG, $BOME, and $SLERF.</p>
<p>Together, meme coins collectively demonstrate the robustness and value of the Solana blockchain. Now enter DogWifCat, which is already going parabolic less than 24 hours after launching.</p>
<p>Everyone in crypto now surely knows of the Wif-hat riff and its multiplying variants.</p>
<p>Well, DogWifCat is doing things a little differently from the rest of the pack by dispensing with the hat and going for a rhyming cat instead.</p>
<p>It has a definite ring to it, which counts for a lot in the meme coin world that is all about virality.</p>
<p>$DWIFC has raced to a market capitalization of $17.1 million from nowhere. 24-hour trading volumes currently sit at $5.44 million.</p>
<p>DogWifCat has a total token supply of 1 billion – the $DWIFC token address is <a href="https://birdeye.so/token/wifhHP4nsNmhXJx9Rrq9NFiYShUTFAreM5LKHso5qXK?chain=solana">wifhHP4nsNmhXJx9Rrq9NFiYShUTFAreM5LKHso5qXK</a>.</p>
<p>$DWIFC can be bought on <a href="https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-DWIFC_wifhHP4nsNmhXJx9Rrq9NFiYShUTFAreM5LKHso5qXK">Jupiter</a> or <a href="https://raydium.io/swap/?inputCurrency=sol&amp;outputCurrency=wifhHP4nsNmhXJx9Rrq9NFiYShUTFAreM5LKHso5qXK&amp;outputSymbol=DWIFC&amp;fixed=in">Raydium</a> decentralized exchanges by swapping SOL using Solana or a Solana-based token.</p>
<p>The present juncture in the market could be a good time to take profits on some of the other Solana token high-fliers such as $BONK, $MYRO, $BOME, and $SLERF, and rotate some of those mega-profits into <a href="https://www.dogwifcatcoin.io/">$DWIFC</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LayerZero co-founder and CEO Bryan Pellegrino accused Kyle Davies, co-founder of the now-defunct Three Arrows Capital (3AC), of trying to persuade his firm to transfer its entire treasury shortly before the liquidation of 3AC on March 21.</p>
<p>Pellegrino made the <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimordialAA/status/1770820900465602802">allegation in an X post</a> as a response to Davies&#8217; comment on a podcast.</p>
<h2>Pellegrino Asserts Davies Misled &amp; Exploited Partners</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pellegrino alleged that Davies tried to get the entire treasury of LayerZero, &#8220;promising better rates than other borrowers as a last-gasp effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>This revelation came to light when the co-founder of the defunct hedge fund <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/3ac-co-founder-kyle-davies-stands-firm-wont-apologize-for-crypto-hedge-fund-bankruptcy.htm">refused to apologize to investors</a> for the collapse of 3AC in an episode of the Unchained YouTube interview podcast on March 19.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="3AC&#039;s Kyle Davies on Why He&#039;s Crypto&#039;s Lloyd Blankfein and Why He&#039;s Not Sorry - Ep. 621" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IEsjWV7GRgY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The LayerZero CEO further claimed that 3AC resolved to borrow funds from various firms, even though the firm knew it was financially unable to pay back the loans amid private preparation for its liquidation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I would agree with this 100% and would be in your corner except for the fact that you tried to get us to give you our entire treasury promising better rates than other borrowers as a last gasp effort just days before you blew up.</p>
<p>&mdash; Bryan Pellegrino (@PrimordialAA) <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimordialAA/status/1770819489577255278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Pellegrino criticized Davies for misleading and taking advantage of <a href="https://x.com/PrimordialAA/status/1770819601355411584?s=20">friends, associates, and partners, including Arthur Hayes</a>, the co-founder of BitMex exchange.</p>
<p>While Pellegrino’s accusations seem deep-rooted in betrayal and soured friendship, he has gained support from many crypto enthusiasts and case observers who believe Davies borrowed funds with false claims.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You borrowed money with fraudulent claims.  Thats simple financial fraud, and in a common sense ethical context…simple stealing.  Losing other peoples’ money isn’t inherently unethical or illegal.  But it’s both when you took their money under false pretenses.  Don’t apologize…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Another X user, @basedkarbon, also <a href="https://x.com/basedkarbon/status/1770807566911566121?s=20">slammed Davies for not being tactful</a> with his response.</p>
<h2>The Fall of 3AC &amp; Impacts on the Crypto Sphere</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Davies and Su Zhu started 3AC in 2012, and the fund <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/06/16/crypto-crash-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-insolvency-rumors-novogratz/">reportedly managed an estimated $10 billion</a> in assets as of 2021. But, the value dropped to $3 billion in April 2022.</p>
<p>The major fall in the fortunes of 3AC was attributed to the crash of TerraUSD stablecoins in 2022, which led to a crypto crash that wiped out billions in value.</p>
<p>The now-defunct hedge fund <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22077923-three-arrows-capital-bankruptcy-filing?responsive=0&amp;title=1&amp;onlyshoworg=1%27">filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy</a> on July 1, 2022, to protect its assets from creditors.</p>
<p>The 3AC collapse had a severe impact on several investors and companies. This is because <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/three-arrows-capital-founders-face-13-billion-claim-from-liquidators.htm">3AC had a lengthy list of early and late counterparties</a> and organizations that had their funds wrapped up with the firm. The bankruptcy filing noted that the hedge fund owed $3.5 billion to 27 companies, including $2.3 billion to Genesis Global Trading.</p>
<p>Additionally, crypto trading platform Blockchain.com faced a $270 million hit on loans to 3AC, while renowned digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/voyager-digital-commences-financial-restructuring-process-to-maximize-value-for-all-stakeholders-301581177.html">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> due to a default on about $670 million in loans made to 3AC.</p>
