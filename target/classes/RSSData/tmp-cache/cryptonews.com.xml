<p>Amidst escalating legal tensions, Ripple Labs is confronted with a $2 billion fine proposed by the SEC, an announcement that has rippled through the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Ripple&#8217;s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, and CLO, Stuart Alderoty, shared their insights on March 25, highlighting a judicial move to scrutinize the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Ripple.</p>
<p>They criticize the regulatory body&#8217;s hefty penalty as overly punitive.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This critical juncture not only spotlights the regulatory challenges faced by Ripple but also casts a spotlight on the implications for XRP&#8217;s market value, leading many to speculate on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/xrp-price-prediction/">XRP price prediction</a>.</p>
<p>The community and investors alike are keenly observing how this legal standoff might pave the way for XRP&#8217;s financial trajectory and whether it signifies a looming rally post-resolution.</p>
<h2><span>Ripple vs. SEC: Landmark Ruling Sparks Debate on Crypto Regulation</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>In December 2020, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/sec-seeking-2-billion-ripple-labs-chief-legal-officer-says-2024-03-25/#:~:text=The%20SEC%20sued%20Ripple%2C%20its,Garlinghouse%20and%20Larsen%20in%20October.">SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple</a> and its executives for selling $1.3 billion in unregistered XRP tokens. </span></p>
<p><span>A significant turn came in July 2023, when Judge Torres decided XRP was not a security on crypto exchanges, leading the SEC to retract its charges against Ripple&#8217;s CEO and co-founder by October 2023. </span></p>
<p><span>Despite these developments, the SEC continues its crackdown on other major crypto firms.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Judge Torres&#8217;s ruling reshapes the crypto regulatory landscape.</li>
<li>SEC drops charges against Ripple executives, stirring industry debate.</li>
<li>Ongoing SEC actions against other crypto companies keep regulatory uncertainties alive.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ripple vs. SEC saga underscores the complex debate over cryptocurrency regulation and the SEC&#8217;s oversight role, influencing market dynamics and investor outlook.</p>
<h2>Ripple&#8217;s Standoff with SEC Over $2B Fine Raises Market Speculation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Ripple is gearing up to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-03-26-2024/card/sec-seeks-nearly-2-billion-fine-from-crypto-firm-ripple-xZTMF082oExQOUxJP91B#:~:text=The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission,court%20documents%20made%20public%20today.">fight a massive $2-billion fine proposed</a> by the SEC, after a Utah judge recently criticized the SEC for mishandling evidence in a separate case. </span></p>
<p><span>Ripple&#8217;s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has openly condemned the fine, hinting at revealing the SEC&#8217;s real intentions in an upcoming April response. </span></p>
<p><span>This legal battle, sparked by a 2020 SEC lawsuit over alleged unregistered XRP sales, has stirred significant market uncertainty.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple &#8211; and the industry at large. 3/4</p>

<h2><b>XRP Price Prediction</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The technical analysis of XRP/USD , based on a four-hour chart, presents a pivot point at $0.63106, establishing immediate resistance levels at $0.67963, $0.70700, and $0.73164, and support levels at $0.60367, $0.58624, and $0.56798.</p>
<figure id="attachment_189822" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189822" style="width: 1745px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-189822" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27031838/1711509518-xrp.jpg" alt="XRP Price Chart - Source: Tradingview" width="1745" height="915" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27031838/1711509518-xrp.jpg 1745w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27031838/1711509518-xrp-300x157.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27031838/1711509518-xrp-1024x537.jpg 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27031838/1711509518-xrp-768x403.jpg 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27031838/1711509518-xrp-1536x805.jpg 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/27031838/1711509518-xrp-150x79.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1745px) 100vw, 1745px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-189822" class="wp-caption-text">XRP Price Chart &#8211; Source: Tradingview</figcaption></figure>
<p>Key indicators, such as the RSI at 46 and the 50-day EMA at $0.62799, signal a bullish sentiment, bolstered by an upward trendline pattern that suggests potential for upward movement.</p>
<p>However, should XRP fall below its pivot point, it might indicate a trend shift, urging caution among investors for potential market sell-offs.</p>
<p>The outlook for XRP/USD remains optimistic above $0.63106, but the market&#8217;s volatile nature warrants vigilant monitoring for any sudden changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian ministries could be prepared to “legalize” industrial crypto mining <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-treasury-russia-blockchain-firms-sanctions-evasion.htm">in the country.</a> But one key department could yet throw a spanner in the works.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-crypto-miners-tell-lawmakers-hurry-up-legalize-our-industry.htm">After years of dismay and repeated pleas for Moscow to formally recognize mining as a form of “entrepreneurship,”</a> miners this month submitted a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-crypto-industry-sends-government-draft-mining-bill.htm">new draft bill</a> to ministries.</p>
<p>Per the Russian newspaper <a href="https://iz.ru/1670067/mariia-kolobova/kody-letiat-vlasti-khotiat-priznat-maining-otrasliu-promyshlennosti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Izvestia</a>, most ministers are now ready to grant mining legal status.</p>
<p>However, the Ministry of Industry and Trade – which has the final say on business classifications – is not convinced.</p>
<h2>Russian Ministries ‘Break Ice’ on Crypto Mining Discussion</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Miners want Moscow to recognize their business as an industry. They want the state to assign mining a code in the All-Russian Classifier of Economic Activities (OKVED).</p>
<p>The Ministry of Energy told Izvestia that it “supports” this move, as does the Ministry of Economic Development.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, <em>Cryptonews.com</em> believes, is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-finance-ministry-outlines-its-vision-of-bitcoin-mining-regulation.htm">also inclined to back the proposal</a>. It has previously suggested legalizing industrial mining, and banning “private” mining ventures.</p>
<p>The media outlet quoted the deputy head of the “relevant” State Duma committee as stating that “not everyone is in favor of” the idea.</p>
<p>But the same lawmaker noted that “the ice has been broken,” and opined that a decision would be forthcoming “within a month.”</p>
<p>MP Valery Seleznev, a member of the State Duma Committee on Energy, said a “number of interdepartmental meetings” have been held on mining in recent weeks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_189450" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189450" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-189450" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26153323/1711467203-duma1.jpg" alt="The Russian State Duma in session." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26153323/1711467203-duma1.jpg 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26153323/1711467203-duma1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26153323/1711467203-duma1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26153323/1711467203-duma1-150x84.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-189450" class="wp-caption-text">The Russian State Duma in session. (Source: Duma.gov.ru [CC BY 4.0])</figcaption></figure>Seleznev noted that the Ministry of Digital Development had little interest in the matter until recently.</p>
<p>But, Seleznev said, the ministry has since had a change of heart and is now participating in talks.</p>
<h2>Not Everyone on Board with Mining Plans, Insiders Say</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Earlier this year, miners suggested that they would allow Russian government officials to make use of their cutting-edge data centers to expand state-run IT projects.</p>
<p>Miners have more support still in the State Duma, where lawmakers Anton Tkachev, Vladimir Plyakin, Grigory Shilkin, and Sardana Avksentyeva have backed their draft bill.</p>
<p>One party that has not yet made its feelings clear is the Central Bank, which has <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-mps-dismiss-central-banks-calls-for-crypto-ban.htm">previously called for a ban on crypto mining</a>.</p>
<p>A financial expert claimed this week that Moscow has little appetite for crypto-related discussions.</p>
<p>She said that the Central Bank and most ministries are instead <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/major-russian-companies-will-be-forced-to-accept-digital-ruble-payments.htm">focusing on rolling out the digital ruble</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Hope Springs for Russian Crypto Miners?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The media outlet said authorities are “considering two options” for legalization. One of these involves “creating a new, separate OKVED category for [crypto] mining.”</p>
<p>The other would see ministers add mining to an “already existing section of the OKVED database.”</p>
<p>Miners have repeatedly called on Moscow to help take their industry out of the legal “grey” zone.</p>
<p>The finance ministry also wants to do this, believing it can expect a tax windfall if mining becomes “legal.”</p>
<p>A crypto mining bill was submitted to the State Duma in 2022, but failed to pass the committee stage after a first reading.</p>
<p>The nation’s biggest mining firm, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitriver-to-build-new-100mw-crypto-mining-center-in-russia.htm">BitRiver</a>, approached the Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov with a legislative proposal in mid-2023. This was also unsuccessful.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The head of the Russian Industrial Mining Association (IPM), Sergei Bezdelov, told the media outlet:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Taking into account the more attractive market conditions for conducting mining activities in the Russian Federation, we have every chance to push the United States out of first place.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this month, the IPM said that Russian industrial miners were <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-crypto-mining-industry-could-be-set-for-4bn-boost.htm">ready to invest $4 billion in the industry</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-crypto-fraudsters-duped-financier-out-of-4-1m.htm">South Korean</a> court has released the son of software giant Hancom Group’s Chairman on bail as prosecutors continue to probe <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/software-titan-hancom-denies-its-ceo-has-a-crypto-slush-fund.htm">an alleged “crypto slush fund.”</a></p>
<p>Officials have been investigating allegations since 2021, when reports began surfacing surrounding the Hancom Group Chairman Kim Sang-cheol.</p>
<p>Kim Sang-cheol, prosecutors think, may be the “secret owner” of an altcoin named Arowana (ARW). The coin is supposedly the brainchild of a firm named Arowana Tech.</p>
<p>It was listed on the Bithumb exchange in mid-2021, but has since been delisted.</p>

<h2>Hancom Investigation Continues</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Hancom is best known in South Korea as the developer of Hancom Office, a widely used suite of word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation software.</p>
<p>The office suite was first released in 2001. It has since become a mainstay in the South Korean corporate world.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20240326117700061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yonhap</a>, the Criminal Division of the Seongnam Branch of the Suwon District Court arrested and indicted Kim’s 35-year-old second son.</p>
<p>The younger Kim will be tried on charges of violations of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes and breach of trust.</p>
<p>The court has also decided to grant bail to an individual surnamed Jeong (47 years old). Jeong was described as the CEO of Arowana Tech.</p>
<p>Police arrested the younger Kim on December 5, and held him in custody for 111 days later. Prosecutors expressed their concerns about the suspects’ flight risk.</p>
<p>But the court eventually decided to grant bail at just under $375,000.</p>
<figure id="attachment_189392" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189392" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-189392" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26140930/1711462170-hancom1.jpg" alt="The headquarters of Hancom." width="768" height="394" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26140930/1711462170-hancom1.jpg 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26140930/1711462170-hancom1-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26140930/1711462170-hancom1-150x77.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-189392" class="wp-caption-text">The headquarters of Hancom. (Source: MBC News/YouTube)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The court also imposed restrictions on both the younger Kim and Jeong’s residence and movements ahead of the trial.</p>
<p>Prosecutors think that “from December 2021 to June 2023,” the younger Kim and Jeong enlisted the aid of a “domestic virtual asset consulting company.”</p>
<p>The prosecution said that the duo asked the company to swap ARW 14.57 million for <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> holdings.</p>
<h2>Suspects ‘Enlisted Help of Overseas Crypto Firm’</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investigators think the company raised almost $6 million “excluding fees” from the sale, and then transferred the ETH and BTC coins to the younger Kim’s “personal electronic device.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors also say they have evidence that “an overseas cryptoasset business” was “asked to sell 4 million Arowana tokens” on the younger Kim’s behalf.</p>
<p>Investigators said the “overseas” firm raised around $1.2 million in crypto from this deal. The coins, prosecutors said, were also transferred to the younger Kim’s wallet.</p>
<p>Investigators said the younger Kim “used the slush fund for personal purposes,” including buying non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/a-beginner-s-guide-to-nfts-what-you-should-know.htm">NFTs</a>).</p>
<p>Prosecutors also think the suspect used the find to trade, pay credit card bills, and buy goods from department stores.</p>
<p>Hancom With, Hancom’s blockchain arm, is a known backer of Arowana Tech. The affiliate invested in Arowana Tech in April 2021, with a view to building a blockchain-powered gold trading business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The National Data Protection Commission (CNPD) of Portugal took decisive action on March 26 to safeguard personal data protection, particularly for minors, by temporarily banning Worldcoin.</p>
<p>In response to concerns raised by numerous complaints, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/sam-altmans-worldcoin-ordered-stop-data-collection-portugal-2024-03-26/">CNPD issued a temporary 90-day restriction</a> on Worldcoin&#8217;s biometric data collection through its Orb devices within Portugal on Tuesday.</p>
<h2>CNPD Issues Urgent Provisional Measure Due to Worldcoin&#8217;s Biometric Data Collection Concerns</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This provisional measure stems from concerns regarding the company collecting biometric data, including iris, eye, and facial scans, without proper consent or authorization.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CNPD <a href="https://www.cnpd.pt/comunicacao-publica/noticias/cnpd-suspende-recolha-de-dados-biometricos/">noted deficiencies in the information provided</a> to data subjects and potential data deletion or revocation issues.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Mais de 300 mil pessoas já forneceram os seus dados biométricos, <a href="https://t.co/aG5HCzvprb">https://t.co/aG5HCzvprb</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The decision was further prompted by media reports indicating that over 300,000 individuals in Portugal had already provided their biometric data.</p>
<p>The rapid proliferation of collection points, particularly in commercial areas, raised concerns about the influx of participants. <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data/">According to the GDPR</a>, biometric data is classified as a special category of data that requires enhanced protection due to its inherent risks.</p>
<p>Minors, being particularly vulnerable, are entitled to special protection under European and national laws.</p>
<p>The CNPD&#8217;s ongoing investigation will analyze incoming reports and take further steps as necessary to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and mitigate potential harm.</p>
<h2>Worldcoin Addresses Legal Uncertainties Regarding Its Digital Identity Project</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Worldcoin, a global digital identity and cryptocurrency project founded by OpenAI CEO <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/sam-altmans-worldcoin-files-lawsuit-after-spanish-ban-2024-03-08/">Sam Altman, has recently addressed legal uncertainties</a> surrounding its operations, particularly in Spain.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The situation in Spain escalated when <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spain-halts-sam-altmans-worldcoin-eyeball-scanning-venture-over-data-concerns.htm">the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) issued a temporary order</a> on March 6, prohibiting Worldcoin from collecting data in the country for three months.</p>
<p>The AEPD cited concerns related to users&#8217; inability to withdraw consent and allegations of data collection from minors. Despite Worldcoin&#8217;s compliance efforts, a local court rejected its injunction against the data regulator.</p>
<p>This development in Spain is separate, as Worldcoin has also faced regulatory scrutiny in other jurisdictions. In January 2024, Hong Kong&#8217;s Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data <a href="https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/news_events/media_statements/press_20240131.html">(PCPD) investigated Worldcoin&#8217;s operations</a> due to concerns about personal data privacy risks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Worldcoin&#8217;s eye-scanning project <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/kenyan-authorities-accuse-worldcoin-of-espionage-statehood-threats.htm">encountered regulatory challenges in Kenya</a>, leading to a government ban on local activities associated with the platform, including biometric identification, in August 2023.</p>
<p>Worldcoin has said it is willing to collaborate with the Kenyan government to resume operations in 2024, however.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong is getting ready to follow the United States&#8217; lead in approving Bitcoin spot ETFs for public trading, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence suggest.</p>
<p>The region’s regulators may go a step further than their Western counterparts, however, by permitting those funds to use an “in-kind” redemption model.</p>
<h2>What Are ‘In Kind’ Bitcoin ETFs?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The redemption model refers to the internal plumbing of how a Bitcoin ETF’s shares track the price of spot-traded BTC. All Bitcoin spot ETFs must hold enough BTC to back all shares issued by the fund, and market makers must be able to redeem those shares for their equivalent BTC value.</p>
<p>This can be accomplished in two ways. One is an ‘in-kind’ redemption model, where market makers can adjust the supply of ETF shares on the market, send them back to the ETF issuer, and receive BTC in return. By contrast, an ‘in-cash’ model creates a lengthier process in which market makers instead receive cash equal to the amount of Bitcoin represented by their shares.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1772602019133423921">According to analyst Rebecca Sin</a>, the unique ‘in-kind’ characteristic could be a big opportunity for Hong Kong’s market.</p>
<p>“In the US it&#8217;s cash in, Bitcoin ETF out, while Hong Kong aims for Bitcoin in, Bitcoin ETF Out,” she explained.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like Hong Kong is going to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs in 2Q (unlike US which is cash creations only), which could help spark aum and volume in the fast-growing region via new note today from <a href="https://twitter.com/RebeccaSin_SK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Rebeccasin_SK</a> <a href="https://t.co/IxcdWEFDvC">https://t.co/IxcdWEFDvC</a> <a href="https://t.co/sDsS4nbzGi">pic.twitter.com/sDsS4nbzGi</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1772602019133423921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Before receiving approval in January, Bitcoin ETF sponsors were at odds with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a fight to allow in-kind redemptions for their ETFs.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-revises-bitcoin-etf-model-to-appease-sec-concerns.htm">Fund managers like BlackRock argued</a> that their in-kind model would boast lower transaction costs, less operating risk, and resistance to market manipulation compared to an in-cash model. Others noted that an in-kind model could involve fewer tax complications that arise from converting BTC into cash.</p>
<p>The SEC ultimately got its way, however, being firmly against the idea of letting U.S. domiciled broker-dealers interact with Bitcoin directly.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Sin added that Hong Kong’s assets under management within ETFs could surge considerably with the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in the region. Their U.S.-based counterparts, for example, have already <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/jpmorgan-expects-62-billion-bitcoin-spot-etfs-market-over-2-to-3-years.htm">reached an aggregate size of $62 billion</a>.</p>
<p>She said the Hong Kong ETF market already includes “leveraged an inverse, Bitcoin, actively managed, and fixed-income ETFs,” alongside covered call ETFs.</p>
<p>In January, Chinese asset manager <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/01/29/hong-kong-gets-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-stablecoin-interest-from-chinas-harvest-global-reports/">Harvest Global Investments applied</a> with Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to launch a Bitcoin spot ETF, alongside Hong Kong-based firm Venture Smart Financial Holdings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain investigator firm Arkham Intelligence announced on March 25 that the fifth-richest Bitcoin whale had moved 94,504 BTC worth $6.05 billion to three new addresses.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin wallet address, also dubbed 37X, has been dormant since 2019.</p>
<h2>37X Activated: Bitcoin Whale Holds 1.31 BTC After Transfer</h2>

<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arkham-intelligence-predicts-grayscales-gbtc-to-run-out-of-bitcoin-in-96-days.htm">Arkham Intelligence</a> revealed in an X post that the Bitcoin whale began the transfer on March 23. In total, the whale sent 94,504 BTC, allocating $5.03B, $561.46M, and $488.40M worth of BTC to three new wallet addresses.</p>

<p>However, the Bitcoin Whale has recorded minimal on-chain interactions since October 8, 2019, and shows no indications of being associated with an exchange.</p>
<p>This is the fifth-richest Bitcoin wallet address, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240314141448/https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">archives from Bitinfocharts</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the wallet address that received $5.03B worth of BTC from this Bitcoin whale now <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">ranks as the sixth-richest Bitcoin address</a>, with 78,317K BTC.</p>
<p>It should be noted that such a big transfer from a three-year-long inactive wallet is not the first in recent months.</p>
<p>On January 5, an <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38900049">unknown whale transferred 26.9 BTC</a> (worth $1.17M at that time) from Binance to the public address of Bitcoin Genesis Block. Another sizeable BTC transfer from an inactive wallet sent 6,500 BTC to new addresses in November 2023.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Interest Heats Up with Spot Bitcoin ETF &amp; Upcoming Halving Event</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Retail and institutional investors have all taken a shine to Bitcoin following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the forthcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled for April 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halving</a> is a quadrennial event that halves the pace at which new coins are released into the market. This makes the current supply of BTC scarcer over time and potentially drives up prices.</p>
<p>A price retracement often accompanies the build-up to Bitcoin halving.</p>
<p>Many market analysts argue that the explosion of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could soften the anticipated price drop. This also aligns with the belief of analysts that the approval of spot <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/spot-bitcoin-etfs-would-reduce-power-of-whales-and-increase-stability-nansen-analyst.htm">Bitcoin ETFs would reduce the power of whales</a> and increase stability.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://dune.com/hildobby/btc-etfs">Dune report</a>, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $58.3B in on-chain holdings, representing 4.17% of the current BTC supply.</p>
<figure id="attachment_189577" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189577" style="width: 3340px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-189577" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26180031/1711476028-screenshot-2024-03-26-at-4-21-03pm.png" alt="Bitcoin Whale" width="3340" height="1817" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26180031/1711476028-screenshot-2024-03-26-at-4-21-03pm.png 3340w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26180031/1711476028-screenshot-2024-03-26-at-4-21-03pm-300x163.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26180031/1711476028-screenshot-2024-03-26-at-4-21-03pm-1024x557.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26180031/1711476028-screenshot-2024-03-26-at-4-21-03pm-768x418.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26180031/1711476028-screenshot-2024-03-26-at-4-21-03pm-1536x836.png 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26180031/1711476028-screenshot-2024-03-26-at-4-21-03pm-2048x1114.png 2048w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26180031/1711476028-screenshot-2024-03-26-at-4-21-03pm-150x82.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 3340px) 100vw, 3340px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-189577" class="wp-caption-text">Dune depth data report on the Bitcoin ETF market shows a total of $58.4B on-chain holdings.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Last month, popular crypto analysis firm Rekt Capital explained that the upcoming Bitcoin halving comprises five phases. The first stage is called pre-halving downside, which sees bearish price movements due to investors anticipating the halving event.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The second stage is the pre-halving rally, which records major BTC price increases due to short-term traders and investors keen to reap the rewards of the halving mainstream hype.</p>
<p>The third stage is the pre-halving retracement, which he believes to be the market&#8217;s current phase. This stage entails investors exiting their positions due to sell pressures.</p>
<p>The fourth phase, known as re-accumulation, is predicted to kickstart after the halving takes place and will see stagnant BTC price movements, which is closely followed by the fifth state, the parabolic uptrend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flux Protocol and Ondo DAO&#8217;s governance token ONDO set a new all-time high (ATH) earlier today, according to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ondo">data</a> by CoinGecko.</p>
<p>In the morning GMT, ONDO rose to a record price of <span>$0.9934, before before pulling back 11% to its current level of $0.8679. </span></p>
<p>ONDO is currently the 95th biggest cryptocurrency in the world with a market capitalization of over $1.2 billion. On its website, the protocol touts itself as &#8220;a new paradigm for securities tokenization&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now that right there may be obvious marketing speak, but it hasn&#8217;t stopped investors from flocking to ONDO after a crucial bit of crypto adoption news last week.</p>
<h2>ONDO Rallies On BlackRock Tokenization News</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Keen-eyed watchers first noticed ONDO&#8217;s price began to increase in the middle of last week on news that BlackRock, the worlds largest asset manager with over $9 trillion in assets-under-management (AUM) <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/20/blackrock-enters-asset-tokenization-race-with-new-fund-on-the-ethereum-network/">launched</a> a tokenized fund on Ethereum with an asset tokenization platform called Securitize.</p>
<p>BlackRock simultaneously announced that it had strategically invested in the tokenization platform but did not disclose details of the deal.</p>
<p>What does this all have to do with ONDO?</p>
<p>After all, we know BlackRock has been bullish on crypto for a while. The fact that the asset manager&#8217;s newly launched Bitcoin ETF is the number one regulated Bitcoin investment product in the world right now since its launch in January proves that the company is bullish.</p>
<p>Tokenization clearly represents BlackRock&#8217;s next move in blockchain. It&#8217;s hardly surprising, considering <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/citi-innovates-with-avalanche-blockchain-to-tokenize-private-equity-funds.htm">Citi</a> and JP Morgan have trialed the technology too recently.</p>
<p>Beyond these two, other titans of TradFi have taken their own first steps in security tokenization, including <span>France’s third largest bank, Société Générale, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/today-in-crypto-sc-ventures-platform-to-enable-first-ever-tokenized-singapore-dollar-government-bond-fund-pundi-x-reveals-pay-via-email-feature.htm">Standard Chartered</a>, and asset managers <a href="https://fr.cryptonews.com/exclusives/institution-financiere-premier-plan-etend-fonds-dinvestissement-polygon.htm">Franklin Templeton,</a> and South Korean&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/500-billion-asset-manager-mirae-partners-with-polygon-new-web3-technology-push.htm">Mirae</a>.</span></p>
<h2>ONDO Price Prediction: New ATH Incoming?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Over on ONDO&#8217;s trading chart, we can see that the token is trading noticeably below its 30-day moving average as it relative strength index (RSI) heads down to 30.</p>
<p>Taken together, the two signs indicate a lot of recent selling pressure in the last few hours.</p>
<figure id="attachment_189524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189524" style="width: 1006px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-189524" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26164947/1711471787-ondousdt_2024-03-26_16-49-31.png" alt="" width="1006" height="643" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26164947/1711471787-ondousdt_2024-03-26_16-49-31.png 1006w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26164947/1711471787-ondousdt_2024-03-26_16-49-31-300x192.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26164947/1711471787-ondousdt_2024-03-26_16-49-31-768x491.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26164947/1711471787-ondousdt_2024-03-26_16-49-31-150x96.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-189524" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Altogether, even if ONDO continues shedding value, it&#8217;s very likely the token can find short-term support at <span>$0.80, a range the token sustained through last week&#8217;s volatility. If Bitcoin continues to rally, which is likely given the upcoming halving on April 19 will cut the new supply in half, then ONDO could foreseeably post a new ATH in the near future. </span></p>
<h2>Soak Up ONDO&#8217;s Slipperiness With SPONGE</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Given ONDO&#8217;s recent volatility, investors may want to look into small-cap altcoins that are still in the midst of a presale. After all, the earlier, the better in a bet like crypto.</p>
<p>One promising new speculation is the meme coin SPONGE. <span>When it launched in May 2023, SPONGE was priced at $0.000025. In less than a year, it has hit around $0.002147, or 8,500% higher!</span></p>
<p>In addition to reinvigorating the meme coin landscape, it’s also the native token for a promising new ecosystem.</p>
<p>SPONGE is an ERC-2o standard token created on Ethereum. It <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sponge-v2-launch-on-polygon-sees-56-pump-as-buyers-stake-for-7500-returns.htm">recently upgraded</a><span> </span>(and migrated) to a V2 on Polygon, an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution. SPONGE currently sells for $0.002918 in an ongoing pre-sale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Kiyosaki, best known for his book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” has voiced his support for Bitcoin once again. On March 26, he described Bitcoin as “the perfect asset at the right time” but noted that it could also be a scam or a Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>The New York Times best-selling author, who has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin over the years, clarified that the potential of a Bitcoin scam is no more than any other fiat currency, including the US Dollar.</p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Tags US Dollar and Other Fiats as “Giant Ponzi Schemes”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Kiyosaki <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1772474875397185846?s=20">shared his concerns in an X post</a>, arguing that Bitcoin could be a Ponzi scheme that might fall to zero. According to him, Bitcoin has the same tendency to depreciate as fiat currencies.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Q:  Are you a Bitcoin Bull?</p>
<p>A. Yes. Bitcoin is the perfect asset at the right time.  I love Bitcoin. Wish I had bought more earlier. </p>
<p>Q:  Is it possible that Bitcoin is a scam, a Ponzi scheme?</p>
<p>A:  Yes. It is possible Bitcoin is a scam and a Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Q:  Aren’t you…</p>
<p>&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1772474875397185846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The author affirmed his undeterred support for Bitcoin by likening his optimism about the crypto asset to <a href="https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_developing-new-products-and-services/s04-12-there-is-power-in-numbers-netw.html">Metcalfe&#8217;s Law</a>, a rule that states that the value of a network increases with the square of the number of its users.</p>
<p>In this instance, the &#8220;number of users&#8221; in the law are retail and institutional traders who use and adopt Bitcoin, making its network valuable.</p>
<p>It could be recalled that Robert Kiyosaki had predicted the price of Bitcoin to scale <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-as-rich-dad-poor-dad-author-predicts-100000-btc-by-june-time-to-buy.htm">as high as $100,000 by the end of 2024</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">BITCOIN  on fire. The biggest mistake you can make is to procrastinate. Important to start, even if only for $500. Next stop $300,000 per BC in 2024</p>
<p>&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1765506264077906271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the concerns and optimism for Bitcoin came in the wake of his recent announcement he will purchase 10 more BTC before the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/">Bitcoin halving</a> in April &#8212; which will slash block rewards to 50%.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am buying 10 more Bitcoin before April. Why?  The “Having.” If you can’t afford a whole Bitcoin  you may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin, via the new ETFs or Satoshi’s.</p>
<p>If the Bitcoin process works as designed you may own a whole Bitcoin by the end of this year. </p>
<p>I…</p>
<p>&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1772115533502259692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I&#8217;m other words, the halving will reduce the amount of BTC that will be mined daily from 900 to 450.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki also believes that most of the digital assets from the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum network</a> will cease to exist because they fail Metcafe’s law due to their lack of a strong network.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Scores All-Time-High Price Mark</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
While Bitcoin volatility is a major consideration for retail and institutional investors, Robert Kiyosaki’s measured outlooks and Metcafe’s concept underpin the growing confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term viability as an investment asset.</p>
<p>At press time, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">BTC trades at $69.700K per coin</a>, recording 30.85% gains in the past 30 days.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the asset has gained further traction due to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/navigating-spot-bitcoin-etfs-in-the-us-what-you-need-to-know.htm">spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>. While there have been recent <a href="https://x.com/CoinSharesCo/status/1772219388172623890?s=20">outflows worth $942M</a>, inflows are still strong at $12.3B. The soaring inflows of Bitcoin ETFs and speculations surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin halving drove BTC to an all-time high price of $73,750 on March 14, 2023.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, Kiyosaki advised traders and investors to look out for valuable insights from experts on how to leverage new opportunities in the digital asset space, but most importantly, to find their own answers.</p>

<p>With XRP (XRP) struggling to keep up with the broader crypto market on Tuesday as traders digest the news that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-to-seek-2-billion-fines-and-penalties-from-ripple-labs-garlinghouse.htm">SEC is seeking to impose a crippling $2 billion fine on XRP issuer Ripple</a>, XRP community members are seeking new ICOs that present potential 1,000% return on income (ROI) opportunities.</p>
<p>XRP was last trading around $0.63, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/">up just 5% in the past seven days</a>.</p>
<p>That compares to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) with 9% run-ups over the same time period.</p>
<p>“The SEC plans to ask the Judge for $2B in a case that involved no allegations (let alone findings) of fraud or recklessness,” Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>“There is absolutely no precedent for this,&#8221; he wrote on X. “We will continue to expose the SEC for what they are when we respond to this.&#8221;</p>
<p>With uncertainty set to continue weighing on XRP, a short-term return to recent multi-month highs near $0.75 seems unlikely.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise then that XRP community members are seeking new ICOs that present potential 1,000% returns on investment (ROI) opportunities.</p>
<h2><strong>New ICOs With 1,000% ROI Potential – eTukTuk ($TUK)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Analysts at Cryptonews keep a close eye on new and up-and-coming ICOs.</p>
<p>One such coin that they think has at least 1,000% ROI potential is an exciting new green crypto called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/">eTukTuk</a>.</p>
<p>eTukTuk is an emerging eco-friendly DePIN crypto project that seeks to accelerate the adoption of electric TukTuks in emerging countries.</p>
<p>And investors have been piling into the green crypto’s $TUK token presale.</p>
<p>The sustainable transportation-focused web3 start-up is close to having raised $2.5 million.</p>
<p>With so many crypto experts accumulating this green crypto, it’s no wonder investors have been racing to get involved.</p>
<p>Popular British presale analyst Jacob Crypto Bury thinks that, with its strong green AI credentials, $TUK has the prospect of posting 10x gains versus its presale price when it launches across exchanges later in the year.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="New 10X Potential Green AI Crypto?! - eTukTuk Transport Crypto" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZAqetFzMh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Michael Wrubel is also bullish on $TUK, which he thinks could be the future of electric transportation.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="eTukTuk: Why I Am BULLISH On TUK" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mjFEBkZDZ40?start=34&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Clinix Crypto, meanwhile, thinks $TUK has a lot of long-term potential as well.</p>
<p>Investors have also been rushing in ahead of $TUK token price rises.</p>
<p>Each new stage of the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/etuktuk/">eTukTuk</a> presale brings an incremental price increase of 3%, baking in pre-listing gains for early backers (up to a total of 31% across the presale).</p>
<p>And the next price rise is fast approaching when eTukTuk hits $2.679 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With major cryptos likes Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) consolidating close to two-week highs in the $70,000 and $3,600 ranges, traders are turning to the on-chain shitcoin markets to find top crypto gainers today as they hunt for quick gains.</p>
<p>On-chain markets are the markets for digital assets that have been issued directly on top of an existing blockchain.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/shiba-inu-price-prediction/">Shiba Inu (SHIB) token</a> is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.</p>
<p>These tokens can then be traded on decentralized and centralized exchanges (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-decentralized-exchanges/">DEXes</a> and CEXes).</p>
<p>They are often referred to as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> (or shitcoin) markets. Almost anyone can issue a token at any time.</p>
<p>As a result, these <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/cryptocurrency-scams.htm">on-chain markets are replete with scams</a> and pump-and-dump schemes.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-shitcoins-buy/">shitcoin markets</a> are the only place to find tokens that can rally in the 50-100x region.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the top crypto gainers today on Ethereum that traders will be monitoring, as per <a href="https://dexscreener.com/">DEXScreener</a>.</p>

<p>Voidz ($VDZ) has been pumping hard since its launch two days ago.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x661ecc03a464be662133b9a5964a51f1370077f9">DEXScreener</a>, it was last trading with gains of around 135,000% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>$VDZ’s market cap was last around $10.8 million, with just under $600,000 in liquidity.</p>
<p>Whilst those are very impressive numbers for a recently launched coin, traders should exercise extreme caution.</p>
<p>$VDZ has various concerning aspects to its smart contract that suggest it could be a scam.</p>
<p>Its tax (currently 5% buy and sell) is modifiable and Transfers are pausable.</p>
<h3><strong>Shiva Inu ($SHIV)</strong></h3>
<p>Another recently launched shitcoin called Shiva Inu ($SHIV) is also pumping hard.</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x42c2b823b358ad7617ac2de094400c26fa437f97">DEXScreener</a>, it was up 65,000% in 24 hours, reaching a market cap of $2.7 million. It also has $224,000 in locked liquidity, reducing rug pull risk.</p>
<p>But this token also has some concerning smart contract aspects, such as a modifiable tax.</p>
<p>It’s crucial that shitcoin traders always do their due diligence. These are very dangerous markets.</p>
<h3><strong>Decentralized Cloud Infrastructure ($DCI)</strong></h3>
<p>Decentralized Cloud Infrastructure ($DCI) is up 13,000% since launching on Ethereum earlier today.</p>
<p>Its market cap has now reached close to $3 million amid $1 million in trading volumes. The token also has $427,000 in locked liquidity.</p>
<p>But its issuer retains the power to change the token’s tax. This means, at any moment, they could jack up the tax to 100% and essentially steal all investors’ tokens.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy.</p>
<p>Any project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower.</p>
<p>A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">getting involved in crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price.</p>
<p>These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing.</p>
<p>While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales—unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision—savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more.</p>
<p>With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market.</p>
<p>Here are 14 of the presale projects with the highest potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders were just charged by US authorities for operating as an illegal exchange in the USA and failing to implement anti-money laundering protocols.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice (DoJ) charged the exchange and founders Chun Gan and Ke Tang with violating the Bank Secrecy Act and operating as an unlicensed money transmitter business.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">❖ PROMINENT GLOBAL CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE KUCOIN AND TWO OF ITS FOUNDERS CRIMINALLY CHARGED WITH BANK SECRECY ACT AND UNLICENSED MONEY TRANSMISSION OFFENSES: DOJ</p>
<p>&mdash; *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeItaone/status/1772640109067657270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>DoJ alleges that KuCoin didn’t implement any <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/kyc-in-crypto/">know-your-customer</a> (KYC) or <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/eba-seeks-to-harmonize-aml-measures-with-extension-to-crypto-firms.htm">anti-money laundering</a> controls until 2023. Even then, these controls didn’t apply to existing customers.</p>
<p>The lack of controls allowed more than $9 billion in suspicious transactions to take place.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">KuCoin and its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang, have been charged by the DOJ.</p>
<p>Why? For operating without a license and violating the Bank Secrecy Act. </p>
<p>So? $9 billion in suspicious transactions allegedly resulted from the lack of anti-money laundering (AML) measures.</p>
<p>&mdash; Ariel Givner, Esq. (@GivnerAriel) <a href="https://twitter.com/GivnerAriel/status/1772644981544472690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8884-24">Commodity Futures and Trade Commission (CFTC) also charged</a> KuCoin with multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.</p>
<p>The CFTC is seeking to impose fines and trading bans, while the DoJ is seeking forfeiture and to pursue criminal penalties.</p>
<p>US Attorney Damien Williams said KuCoin tried to hide that it was being used by “substantial numbers of U.S. users”.</p>
<p>“In failing to implement even basic anti-money laundering policies, the defendants allowed KuCoin to operate in the shadows of the financial markets and be used as a haven for illicit money laundering, with KuCoin receiving over $5 billion and sending over $4 billion of suspicious and criminal funds,” Williams noted.</p>
<h2><strong>CFTC Hits Back At SEC’s Claim That Ether (ETH) Is a Commodity</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Tuesday&#8217;s dual action against KuCoin by the DoJ and CFTC comes a few months after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bernstein-report-binance-will-remain-the-top-global-crypto-exchange-despite-doj-settlement.htm">US regulators settled similar charges against Binance</a>.</p>
<p>Nestled into its lawsuit against KuCoin, the CFTC is once again staking its claim on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-is-not-a-security-new-cftc-chief-4838.htm">regulatory authority over Ether</a>.</p>
<p>“During the Relevant Period, KuCoin solicited and accepted orders involving digital assets that are commodities, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC)”, the CFTC said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">“During the Relevant Period, KuCoin solicited and accepted orders…involving digital assets that are commodities including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and litecoin (LTC).”<a href="https://twitter.com/CFTC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CFTC</a> shots fired in wake of reports of <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECGov</a>’s ETH-as-security investigation from last week <a href="https://t.co/nYN0KWg1Iy">pic.twitter.com/nYN0KWg1Iy</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>That news only had a short-lived impact on the Ether price.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-news/">ETH</a> dipped to just above $3,000 last week. But it has since recovered to above $3,500.</p>
<p>That’s partly helped by a broad crypto market rally that has seen Bitcoin retake $70,000. But <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrock-fund-securitize-hints-at-asset-tokenization.htm">BlackRock’s first foray into asset tokenization</a> also helped ETH recover.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A new report released on Tuesday outlines the recommendations of a technology working group supported by the UK government, which encourages companies to adopt tokenization strategies in collaboration with their industry peers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The United Kingdom&#8217;s financial regulator has endorsed a blueprint model designed to facilitate the tokenization of funds for asset management firms.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Working Group Advocates for Fund Tokenization to Enhance Market Efficiency</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">On Tuesday, the group</span> <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.theia.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/Further%20Fund%20Tokenisation%20-%20Achieving%20IF3%20Through%20Collaboration%20%20Mar24.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">released a new report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that expands the group&#8217;s previous recommendations from November, which called for regulatory clarity regarding tokenization as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/finance-institutions-warm-tokenization-crypto-revolutionizing-real-estate-presale-now.htm">companies increasingly show interest in this technology</a>. The report &#8220;<em>FURTHER FUND TOKENIZATION: ACHIEVING INVESTMENT FUND 3.0 THROUGH COLLABORATION</em>,&#8221; outlines a 30-page comprehensive baseline model to enhance delivery efficiencies and enable effective interaction with digital capital markets and future investors.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The new report highlights the potential benefits of tokenizing units of money market funds used as collateral, which could expedite settlement processes and create new opportunities for this application.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to feedback from industry stakeholders, the working group emphasizes the importance of on-chain fund settlement using digital currency. They advocate for funds to hold tokenized assets and utilize public permissioned networks, allowing verified users access to the blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report highlights two critical use cases for fund tokenization aimed at fostering momentum in the UK market. Firstly, it identifies fully on-chain investment markets, where tokenized funds invest in tokenized securities across various asset classes. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Secondly, it suggests using tokenized money market fund units as collateral, subject to eligibility under UK regulations for non-centrally cleared derivative contracts. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Similarly, the report outlines three important steps for further development of fund tokenization, including allowing on-chain fund settlement via digital money, enabling funds to hold tokenized assets, and expanding solutions to include public permissioned networks. It also</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> suggests that tokenizing money market fund units used as collateral could expedite relevant settlement processes, creating more opportunities for this use case.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, the government plans to explore the benefits of incorporating distributed ledger technology into sovereign bonds.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">UK Investment Managers Embrace Blockchain for Fund Tokenization With Regulatory Support</span></strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">In November 2023, investment managers in the United Kingdom </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tokenization-of-investment-funds-now-permitted-in-the-uk-adoption-on-the-rise.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">received regulatory support</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to explore using blockchain technology for tokenizing funds, departing from conventional record-keeping systems. </span></p>
<p><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.theia.org/sites/default/files/2023-11/UK%20Fund%20Tokenisation%20-%20A%20Blueprint%20for%20Implementation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the Investment Association advocated for fund tokenization, which involves issuing tokenized units or shares on distributed ledger technology (DLT) to enhance efficiency and transparency in the financial industry. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As stated by the firm, the adoption that allows real-time record-keeping systems shared across all fund service providers is expected to reduce administration costs, simplify reconciliation processes, and enable faster settlement times. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">expressed</span></a> <span data-preserver-spaces="true">openness to innovative solutions while emphasizing the importance of addressing potential risks. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The report proposed principles for implementing tokenized funds, ensuring their relevance to domestic and international investors, and promoting inclusivity across the sector. It further highlighted the importance of a roadmap for delivery and focused on enhancing competitiveness and efficiency within the industry.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It clarified that legal and regulatory rules would remain unchanged despite the adoption of blockchain technology.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In response to the November report, Sarah Pritchard, executive director of markets and international at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), highlighted the importance of exploring innovative solutions while addressing potential risks. </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She said that they &#8220;want to support firms in implementing technological solutions that enhance and strengthen the UK&#8217;s asset management industry while addressing risks and potential harms.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the group&#8217;s report, the third phase will focus on artificial intelligence, emphasizing tokenization implementation and collaboration with firms to capitalize on its potential benefits for consumers and the UK economy.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an exclusive interview with <em>Cryptonews</em>, Gerald Heydenreich, the founder of Web3 email platform <strong>EtherMail</strong>, talked about his path from Web1 to Web3, the similarities between Web1 and Web3, and reinventing email, which is used by 4.3 billion people globally.</p>
<p>The veteran entrepreneur further explained what EtherMail is and why it’s an industry changer.</p>
<p>In this episode, Gerald Heydenreich discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>the launch of the new Email-as-a-Wallet product;</li>
<li>EtherMail backstory and advertising platform;</li>
<li>the upcoming token and mobile app launches;</li>
<li>the future of email and how it could change email commerce forever;</li>
<li>emails not going anywhere, as 320 billion are sent every day.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Gerald Heydenreich, Founder of EtherMail, on Web3 Email, Tokenization, and The Future of Email" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hA6Ca2wkC_U?list=PLnVONhlD76ZuEL2egas4CFACNlJRZrsm8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>You can watch the full podcast episode above or read some of what Heydenreich and Matt chatted about below.</p>
<h2>Going From Web1 to Web3</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
One of the many interesting facts about Heydenreich is that his start was essentially in Web1 with his first business.</p>
<p>It was a crazy time – a new frontier – and it was very similar to what we’re seeing today, he argued.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was the same hype, the same craziness, the same crazy parties, the crazy IPOs and everything.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Heydenreich says he loved this time filled with fundamental changes and &#8220;real visionaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a “paradigm shift,” offering many new opportunities to those who wanted to seize them.</p>
<p>Web2, he suggests, is different. “A lot of the spaces have been staked, basically. People know exactly where the big players are.”</p>
<p>But then, a new era came. “It&#8217;s a blank level playing field for everybody. And you can really start from scratch and re-innovate.”</p>
<p>Gerald Heydenreich found that he was a place in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/web3-platform-friend-tech-transforms-ownership-shares-stake-with-users.htm">Web3</a>: learning and getting a lot of input on the one hand and, on the other, giving “a little bit back” of what he’s learned over the past two decades in Web1 and Web2 eras.</p>
<p>He can use the lessons he learned in the traditional building and apply them to something new. “So that&#8217;s the reason why I made the jump,” Heydenreich said.</p>
<p>The “triggering moment,” he said, was realizing – through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theolyverse/reel/Ceyke1uIGjb/">Álvaro Morte’s NFT collection</a> – just how quickly some non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/nft-news-today.htm">NFTs</a>) can sell for a lot of money.</p>
<p>Following that moment, the entrepreneur dug deep to understand the crypto sector, “realizing, wow, there&#8217;s so many opportunities out there.”</p>
<p>Co-founder Shant Kevonian found that many projects don’t have a way to communicate effectively, asking: “Why don&#8217;t we try email and connect a wallet to an email?”</p>
<p>EtherMail was born.</p>
<h2>Reinventing Email</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A major step toward the much-desired mainstream adoption is creating a crypto-focused product that everyone would want to use. And what better than emails, used globally, every day, by 4.3 billion people?</p>
<p>But another question is, Heydenreich said, why hasn&#8217;t somebody done it already?</p>
<p>Per the entrepreneur, there is an inherent mindset problem sometimes, specifically with ‘degens.’</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is a tendency to get away from everything that was there and build everything completely new.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The assumption is that whatever existed before is inherently bad.</p>
<p>However, many things have the potential to evolve and improve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it&#8217;s really difficult to kill something so widespread: email is the second-largest communication tool on the planet, used by individuals and businesses alike.</p>
<p>And that’s not all. Nobody owns email, said Heydenreich. It&#8217;s a protocol.</p>
<p>Communication is a marketplace. There’s a sender and a receiver. So it’s much easier if you already have a communication channel used by millions – who already know what it is – and then upgrade it.</p>
<p>“And that was the initial trigger for us to say, let&#8217;s reinvent email. Let&#8217;s reimagine email for Web3 by adding the features which are really great.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EtherMail?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EtherMail</a> Email-as-a-Wallet<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <br />Diving into Web3 doesn&#39;t mean struggling with complex wallets anymore; it&#39;s as easy as having an EtherMail account<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f48c.png" alt="💌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />Try <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EaaW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EaaW</a> NOW!<a href="https://t.co/Lr2JqCvqZd">https://t.co/Lr2JqCvqZd</a> <a href="https://t.co/lW3MqeYw6l">pic.twitter.com/lW3MqeYw6l</a></p>
<p>&mdash; EtherMail (@ethermail_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethermail_io/status/1762099804388078031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>With all that said, email is the best-suited product to onboard users from Web2 into Web3, Heydenreich remarked.</p>
<p>This method has proved to be successful so far: people understand <a href="https://ethermail.io/faqs">how to enter Web3 via email</a> and wallet-to-wallet communication.</p>
<p>For example, when making a purchase, these emails offer users transparency into their actions, security against scams, signing transactions within the email, and a full transaction record.</p>
<p>EtherMail has released the app into the <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Android</strong> stores. In the beginning, it has “some basic features, but step by step, we&#8217;ll actually really fill it out into a [Web3] gateway,” the founder said.</p>
<h2>The Three Layers of EtherMail</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
EtherMail is a Web3-based email communication service that utilizes blockchain to facilitate anonymous, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication among users.</p>
<p><a href="https://ethermail.io/faqs">Per</a> the website, its foundational principles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>anonymous communication must be possible;</li>
<li>users should be compensated in proportion to how valuable they are to advertisers;</li>
<li>users should be able to communicate with each other freely.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, EtherMail is essentially three different things at the same time, Heydenreich told the viewers.</p>
<h3>Number One: The Inbox Email</h3>
<p>The wallet address at EtherMail.io is used as any other email with additional benefits that only Web3 allows. You can receive token- and NFT-related emails in your inbox.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of wallet used, the founder said, users give out only the amount of information they want. Using the purchase example from above, they provide only the information necessary to buy what they want to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, instead of a 12-or-so-step process to buy something through an email offer, this solution can do so in two steps. “So it makes a huge difference because all of a sudden, the email is payment, identification, and encryption.”</p>

<p>&mdash; EtherMail (@ethermail_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethermail_io/status/1765322003538461003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Whatever currency the two parties agree on will be sent. “At the beginning, perhaps it&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/usd-coin/"><strong>USDC</strong> </a>because the company might not be willing to accept cryptocurrencies. But in the future, they might also accept <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a></strong>.”</p>
<p>“And the beauty” is that there is no reason to urge businesses to change systems: they already use emails.</p>
<p>Another example is that users can send money via email because it’s a wallet-to-wallet transaction.</p>
<h3>Number Two: The Company Side</h3>
<p>On the sender side, the email looks at what the wallet contains and, based on activity, can send customized emails, Heydenreich said.</p>
<p>The system can also look at the smart contract layer and provide the company with a self-updating registry of all the emails of the current holders of that company’s token and NFT.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is ensuring that you always have an updated information connection to the people who own your assets.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Another example is the future tokenization of assets, stocks, and bonds, among other things.</p>
<p>The wallet will enable a direct communication channel between the issuer of those assets and the holder for as long as the holder has them in the wallet.</p>
<h3>Number Three: Changing The Way Advertisement Is Done</h3>
<p>“The EtherMail solution allows advertisers and users to collectively provide a high-quality email marketing and communication experience in which both parties know what they’re getting from each other,” the website says.</p>
<p>Today, we receive a lot of spam in our inboxes, and if we are interested in a service/product, we need to subscribe and give permission to receive promotional content. We also lose track of these permissions.</p>
<p>Companies may also decide to sell our data, or it can be stolen in a security breach.</p>
<p>Web3 changes this, says Gerald Heydenreich. The permission layer will go to the user. EtherMail’s privacy wall lets users define from whom they’re willing to receive advertisements.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We essentially give back advertising money to the users because today, of course, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, they don&#8217;t share their advertising with you.”</p></blockquote>
<p>EtherMail converts a significant portion of the advertising revenue into the soon-to-be-launched email token (EMT) and gives it to the users, Heydenreich said.</p>
<p>They aim to make it a universal email token, Heydenreich noted. They will be releasing it, not on a time-based schedule, but on a user-based schedule, to ensure that there is a supply and demand.</p>
<p>“We believe that the invasion of your privacy in your inbox means your time,” Heydenreich said. This is compensation for the time you took to open it, read it, delete it, interact with it, invite other users, etc.</p>
<p>Also, the team is in the process of negotiating that the EMT can be used in the ecosystem&#8217;s third-party applications.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the future, the AI could also use this communication channel to interact with other protocols that do things on your behalf, Heydenreich said. It&#8217;s a transaction and a payment layer, and it knows what you need. “It will just do things automatically.”</p>
<p>Therefore, email is not going anywhere, the founder said. “It will definitely stay, provided that actually can also evolve into something new. And, of course, we hope that EtherMail will be the next Gmail of the future.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Yet, despite its testicular name, this new meme coin could be on the verge of major gains, with investors&#8217; optimism growing amid LIGMA&#8217;s claims of soon launching the fastest nodes on the Solana <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solana-price-prediction-as-sol-bounces-6-7-new-rally-starting.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">network</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>LIGMA Price Analysis: What&#8217;s Next For Node Utility Solana Meme Coin?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As price action stabilizes following a dramatic launch, LIGMA is currently trading at a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/2AvbJNsiDD99yYYgk7eGKXuKU4PRVibQYFv6xfNA5Fce?t=1711468370030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market price of $0.00173</a> (representing a 24-hour change of -7.1%).</p>
<p>LIGMA launched at midnight (UTC) on March 25, in a move that saw impressive traction in the first two hours.</p>
<p>A huge influx of over $3.28m in volume flooded in, with Solana meme coin investors flocking to the project&#8217;s promise of genuine infrastructural utility.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-189483" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26161058/1711469458-ligma_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-03-26_16-10-52.png" alt="" width="1473" height="592" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26161058/1711469458-ligma_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-03-26_16-10-52.png 1473w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26161058/1711469458-ligma_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-03-26_16-10-52-300x121.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26161058/1711469458-ligma_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-03-26_16-10-52-1024x412.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26161058/1711469458-ligma_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-03-26_16-10-52-768x309.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26161058/1711469458-ligma_usd-ray-dextools-io_2024-03-26_16-10-52-150x60.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1473px) 100vw, 1473px" /></p>
<p>The surge in buys fuelled LIGMA price on an aggressive +188,000% climb, with the price hitting an all-time high at $0.0031.</p>
<p>However, with the price dramatically over-extended, in the hours since, a -74% retracement move set in.</p>
<p>But, in a remarkable display, this has been incredibly well-defended by more than 2.78k holders &#8211; with price action consolidation above strong support at $0.001.</p>
<p>This creates opportunity, with genuine utility still at the heart of the hold effort, and a market cap of $1.51m, still creating ample opportunity for as much as 10x gains in the near future.</p>
<p>A $130k liquidity pool backs confidence, although retail investors should exercise some caution over its unlocked nature.</p>
<p>Yet, while LIGMA offers a solid entry, for investors trying to make the biggest returns, it pays to get ahead of the pump &#8211; and this is driving growing interest in the DOGECOIN20 presale.</p>

<p>Dogecoin20 is a successor play to the top coin in the vertical Dogecoin (DOGE), and the presale&#8217;s dynamic run has been triggered largely by the chance to buy the next DOGE at just 0.0001% of Dogecoin’s market cap.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, if DOGECOIN20 replicates just 1% of Dogecoin’s success, and hits a $192M market cap – investors could be sat atop a 50x return.</p>
<p><strong>Revolutionizing Meme Coins:</strong><span> </span>Beckoning with the hope of retail investors, Dogecoin20 is poised to revolutionize the meme coin vertical, with over $10m raised in its first 2 week of presale, this innovative token pays homage to the OG meme coin while blazing its own trail of innovation and utility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. has slapped Russia with more sanctions – this time targeting a number of crypto-related entities and individuals due to potential evasions aimed at funding the Putin-led country&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine – according to a Monday press release from the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).</p>
<h2>U.S. Sanctions 13 Russian Crypto Companies, Two Individuals</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2204">Monday’s announcement</a> marked a total of 13 blockchain-based entities and two individuals sanctioned in aiding Russia’s curtailing of the “international financial system to further its war against Ukraine,” OFAC’s press release revealed.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today Treasury sanctioned 13 companies and two people for supporting Russian sanctions evasion attempts through virtual asset services. As the Kremlin seeks to leverage the financial technology space, we will continue to expose and disrupt these companies. <a href="https://t.co/NOBh53Esq5">https://t.co/NOBh53Esq5</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Treasury Department (@USTreasury) <a href="https://twitter.com/USTreasury/status/1772316254721696159?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>The newly sanctioned entities have “helped build or operate blockchain-based services for, or enabled virtual currency payments in, the Russian financial sector,” leading to potential sanctions evasions.</span></p>
<p><span>“Russia is increasingly turning to alternative payment mechanisms to circumvent U.S. sanctions and continue to fund its war against Ukraine,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian E. Nelson. </span></p>
<p><span>“As the Kremlin seeks to leverage entities in the financial technology space,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;Treasury will continue to expose and disrupt the companies that seek to help sanctioned Russian financial institutions reconnect to the global financial system.”</span></p>
<h2>On-And-Off Ramp Activities Are New Focus Point For OFAC, Chainalysis Says</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Tuesday’s sanction package comes just one month after the U.S. marked the two-year anniversary of the invasion in Ukraine and the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny by sanctioning over 500 of the Putin-led country’s targets.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/OFAC-sanctions-russia-blockchain-companies-netex24-bitpapa/">According to blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis</a>, two of the sanctioned companies, Netex24 and Bitpapa, facilitated transactions for several Russian militia and propaganda groups, including OFAC-designated MOO Veche.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, OFAC sanctioned 12 entities and 2 individuals for helping to build or operate blockchain-based services facilitating potential sanctions evasion on behalf of Russian nationals. Check out our blog to learn more about their on-chain activities: <a href="https://t.co/k90ApyndER">https://t.co/k90ApyndER</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>Chainalysis further noted that “sanctions evasion through the utilization of cryptocurrency businesses to facilitate on- and off-ramp activities for sanctioned Russian banks appears to be a growing focus for OFAC.” </span></p>
<p><span>According to the U.S. Treasury, over 4,000 individuals and entities have been sanctioned in connection with Russia in the past two years alone.</span></p>
<p><span>“These efforts expand on an already extensive focus of the illicit Russian crypto ecosystem, which includes ransomware, darknet markets, militia groups, disinformation groups, and various other cybercrime actors,” the statement continues.</span></p>
<h2>U.S. Politicians Push For Heightened Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Following the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, numerous <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/pro-russian-crypto-donations-war-in-ukraine/">crypto donations poured into </a></span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/pro-russian-crypto-donations-war-in-ukraine/"><span>blockchain-related organizations</span></a><span> throughout Russia, leading “propaganda sites to the purchase of military items, like drones, weapons, bulletproof vests, communication devices and various other supplies.”</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, U.S. politicians such as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/crypto-regulations/">Senator Elizabeth Warren have pushed for greater regulation of the crypto sector</a>, going so far as to draft the bipartisan Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act (DAAMLA).</span></p>
<p><span>“Crypto is enabling rogue nations, drug lords, ransomware gangs, and fraudsters to launder billions in stolen funds, evade sanctions, fund illegal weapons programs, and profit from devastating cyberattacks,” </span><a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-marshall-manchin-graham-expand-coalition-for-bipartisan-bill-cracking-down-on-cryptos-use-in-money-laundering-drug-trafficking-sanctions-evasion">Senator Warren said about the bill</a>.<span> “Our expanding coalition shows that Congress is ready to take action.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>As major crypto consolidate close to two-week highs, with Bitcoin (BTC) holding just above $70,000 and Ether (ETH) near $3,600, traders hunting for the best crypto to buy today are scouring movers and shakers in the altcoin market.</p>
<p>Crypto sentiment got a boost on Monday amid macro tailwinds and news that the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/london-stock-exchange-to-roll-out-crypto-etns-on-may-28.htm">London Stock Exchange plans to list Bitcoin and Ether ETNs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-exchange-traded-funds-see-net-inflow-following-five-days-of-outflows.htm">Spot Bitcoin ETFs also saw net inflows</a> for the first time in 5 days. That’s despite <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gbtc-bleeds-another-443-million-as-bitcoin-price-drops-below-61000.htm">GBTC bleeding</a> another $350 million in funds.</p>
<p>As traders weigh the prospect of an imminent, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/great-central-bank-policy-reversal-kicks-off-2024-03-22/">synchronized global central bank easing cycle</a>, ETF flows and the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/">upcoming Bitcoin halving</a>, price risks likely remain tilted to the upside for major cryptos.</p>
<p>Bitcoin stands a good chance of hitting $100,000 this year. The prospect of 40% further gains makes it a strong candidate for best crypto to buy today.</p>
<p>But many traders with a higher risk tolerance will be hoping for much larger short-term gains.</p>
<p>The only place to find assets that stand a chance of posting 5x or more gains is the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/altcoin-news/">altcoin</a> market.</p>
<p>Here are some top performers on Tuesday that could be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Today</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Internet Computer (ICP)</strong></h3>
<p>Up nearly 14% in 24 hours, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/">Internet Computer (ICP)</a> is one of the best-performing cryptos on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Last at $19.50, ICP recently broke convincingly to the north of a prior $10-16 multi-week range.</p>
<p>ICP is now up over 80% since its lows around $10.50 from five days ago. But ICP is still down over 94% down from its record peaks from 2021 around $350.</p>
<p>Its modest market cap of currently just over $10 billion suggests there is plenty of room for growth.</p>
<p>ICP may not hit its 2021 highs soon, but 10x gains are certainly in the cards. That means it could easily be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Aptos (APT)</strong></h3>
<p>Much hyped layer-1 blockchain protocol Aptos (APT) is approaching a retest of its highest-ever levels.</p>
<p>APT was last up 13% on Tuesday in the $18s, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>If it can break to the north of its all-time highs above $20, the sky becomes the limit. That, of course, assumes that Aptos experiences significant real-world adoption in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Aptos was developed by a team of well-connected ex-Facebook employees who were behind the social media platform’s failed Libra cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Compared to its future potential, its $7.4 billion market cap and fully diluted cap of $20.3 billion could be undervalued.</p>
<p>Aptos could well be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Fetch.ai (FET)</strong></h3>
<p>The decentralized machine learning platform Fetch.ai (FET) has been pumping in recent days.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fetch/">last up around 5% in the past 24 hours</a> around $0.975, as per CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>FET is closing in on a retest of its 2021 record highs in the $1.20 area, which could mean quick gains in the region of 20%.</p>
<p>But FET has a modest market cap of only around $800 million and a promising AI use case.</p>
<p>That suggests it could go a lot higher, perhaps posting gains in the region of 4-5x.</p>
<p>That makes Fetch.ai one of the best cryptos to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make 10x gains.</p>
<p>But, for those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 14 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 50% of European cryptocurrency holders owned Bitcoin (BTC) in February, yet the drop in this percentage since January reveals some interesting changes in crypto popularity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 50% of European cryptocurrency holders owned Bitcoin (BTC) in February, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/according-to-cmc-february-2024-crypto-market-analysis">survey data from CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>This actually represents a 3% drop compared to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/according-to-cmc-crypto-market-analysis-2024">similar data for January</a>, yet Bitcoin comfortably remains the most popular cryptocurrency amongst traders in all regions of the world, with investors in Europe the likeliest to hold BTC.</p>
<p>The move from January to February also reveals some interesting shifts in ownership for other cryptocurrencies, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) seeing noticeable spikes in North and South America, Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>At the same time, ownership of Solana has decreased noticeably in all regions, with many investors turning to smaller-cap coins and meme tokens in the wake of the rally that followed January’s Bitcoin ETF approvals.</p>
<p>Of course, with the cryptocurrency market remaining unpredictable and volatile, traders shouldn’t expect the same trends to continue throughout the year.</p>
<p>Instead, they should prepare for the possibility that the market will cyclically shift from overbought to underbought tokens, particularly as it moves from Bitcoin season to alt season (and back again).</p>
<h2>Bitcoin and Ethereum Continue to Dominate Despite Dips</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>It’s perhaps unsurprising that half or nearly half of all cryptocurrency investors in all regions of the world own some BTC. </span></p>
<p><span>Ownership ranged from 49.93% in Europe to 43.44% in North America, yet such percentages represent a slight but noticeable dip compared to January, when 53% of European and 49.7% of North American crypto owners held some Bitcoin.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_189343" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189343" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-189343" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26132904/1711459744-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-february-bitcoin.png" alt="Most popular coins by region chart, Bitcoin." width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26132904/1711459744-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-february-bitcoin.png 1200w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26132904/1711459744-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-february-bitcoin-300x169.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26132904/1711459744-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-february-bitcoin-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26132904/1711459744-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-february-bitcoin-768x432.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26132904/1711459744-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-february-bitcoin-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-189343" class="wp-caption-text">Source: CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>This decline is interesting. </span></p>
<p><span>The most probable explanation is that some investors and traders moved out of BTC and took profits when the cryptocurrency rallied in February, as </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/daily-bitcoin-etf-trading-volume-surges-to-2-billion-highest-since-day-one.htm"><span>Bitcoin ETF volumes increased</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Much the same applies to Ethereum, which saw its popularity decline slightly in all regions in February, while in Africa it actually disappeared completely.</span></p>
<p><span>As with Bitcoin, some may have decided to take profits, while moving into smaller alts.</span></p>
<h2>The Rise (and Fall) of Altcoins</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In fact, this is more or less exactly what we see in the CoinMarketCap data, with several alts seeing increases in ownership from January to February.</p>
<p>In America, Asia and Africa, Shiba Inu (SHIB) ownership rose from 8.5%-11.9% in January to 14.2%-16.2% in February.</p>
<p>This is a noticeable spike, and what’s interesting is that the SHIB price didn’t rally big this year until the very end of February and then early March.</p>
<p>This suggests that at least some retail traders can be ahead of the curve, although with a meme coin such as SHIB it’s always possible that online and social media-based FOMO goaded investors to buy the coin, before it rallied.</p>
<p>We also see a big surge in ownership for PEPE, one of the market’s other big meme coins.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it didn’t even register in CoinMarketCap’s January data, yet by February, ownership had risen to 8.79% for Europe, 11.16% for Oceania, 12.89% for Asia, and 14.32% for Africa.</p>
<p>This likely follows from the sharp rally PEPE enjoyed in the final week of February, which was a prelude to its even bigger rally in March.</p>
<figure id="attachment_189346" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189346" style="width: 1200px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-189346" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26133018/1711459817-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-jan-bitcoin.png" alt="Most popular coins by region in Jan, Bitcoin." width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26133018/1711459817-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-jan-bitcoin.png 1200w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26133018/1711459817-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-jan-bitcoin-300x169.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26133018/1711459817-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-jan-bitcoin-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26133018/1711459817-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-jan-bitcoin-768x432.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/26133018/1711459817-most-popular-coins-by-region-in-jan-bitcoin-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-189346" class="wp-caption-text">Source: CoinMarketCap</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet something different applies to Solana (SOL), which saw a slight but significant decline in ownership between January and February.</p>
<p>As the chart above illustrates, it went from 17.7%-20.9% ownership in all regions of the world to 13.1%-14.5% in the following month.</p>
<p>This time, it’s arguable that some traders wanted to cut their losses, since after a strong end to 2023 SOL spent much of January declining, with some traders potentially exiting to more promising coins.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Localism and Word of Mouth</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Finally, one other interesting entrant is Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE), which gained a 14.9% share of popularity in South America, after appearing nowhere in January.</p>
<p>What’s intriguing about this is that it shows how cryptocurrency popularity and ownership can be dependent less on actual prices and fundamentals, and more on social contagion and word of mouth.</p>
<p>So, if a few influencers in South America begin hyping a coin, it almost inevitably starts to gain in popularity.</p>
<p>This principle helps to explain much of the geographical variation we see in cryptocurrency popularity, since as a global market, popularity should be uniform if all investors are 100% rational actors.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t, of course, which is why we should continue to expect variation in next month&#8217;s data, as well as changes in popularity within regions and across time.</p>

<p>Green Bitcoin is a predict-to-earn staking protocol. The team behind it calls it &#8220;gamified green staking.”</p>
<p>How it works is simple, to get $GBTC rewards on the protocol, users have to buy $GBTC tokens and then stake them on the protocol to begin playing the price prediction game.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Users then make daily predictions on Bitcoin, for instance, whether it will go up or down within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Every 24 hours, those who predicted correctly earn a share of rewards from the daily staking reward pool proportionate to the amount of $GBTC tokens they staked.</p>
<p>Holders can stake tokens for up to six months to earn even bigger rewards. Staking is a fundamental part of Green Bitcoin’s tokenomics. By reducing GBTC’s circulating supply, staking helps drive the price over the long term.</p>
<h2>Green Bitcoin (GBTC) and Bitcoin (BTC): Similarities and Differences</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The $GBTC token has a hard cap of 21 million, a clear nod to its inspiration, Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Having a hard cap on the number of tokens in circulation creates value by ensuring scarcity.</p>
<p>However, Green Bitcoin sets itself apart from its inspiration by its greener energy consumption. To start with, the Green Bitcoin is on Ethereum, which uses a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, meaning the $GBTC token is cleaner and more efficient than its namesake.</p>
<p>Green Bitcoin consumes just 34 watt-hours (Wh) per transaction compared to Bitcoin&#8217;s 1,173,000 Wh.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">With Decentralized and Centralized exchange listings not far away, the momentum Green Bitcoin is generating is getting intense.</p>
<p>We love the movement! <a href="https://t.co/QeOhyUA35f">pic.twitter.com/QeOhyUA35f</a></p>

<h2>$GBTC and Bitcoin&#8217;s Upcoming Halving</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
This year, 2024, will surely go down as the most significant year since Bitcoin&#8217;s launch in January 2009. Bitcoin fans and nerds may argue that the 2021 bull run is what got us to where we are today, with eleven spot Bitcoin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-30.htm">ETFs</a> that are currently the talk of Wall Street, a new all-time high of nearly $74k posted a fortnight ago.</p>
<p>Bitcoin today is casually trading <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">above</a> its former all-time high of $69 and many analysts say it could climb to new highs in the coming months, perfect for anyone wanting to get into gamified green staking.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because on April 19 is Bitcoin&#8217;s fourth quadrennial halving. The halving is an event predetermined by Bitcoin&#8217;s code that slashes miners&#8217; rewards in half. There are thirteen halvings before miners will have mined the total supply of BTC.</p>
<p>Then, they&#8217;ll have to subsist on a transaction fee model.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>To celebrate, we&#39;re giving away a $200 Green Bitcoin airdrop!</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The basic law of supply and demand dictates that when there is a supply squeeze at times of high demand, commodities become more valuable. Bitcoin halvings have historically preceded bull runs and analysts believe this year will be no different, thanks to the noise on Wall Street about Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>All told, it&#8217;s set to be a volatile year for Bitcoin, perfect for anybody who wants to partake in Green Bitcoin&#8217;s gamified green staking.</p>
<p>Get involved by visiting<span> </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/greenbitcoin" rel="sponsored nofollow">the official Green Bitcoin website</a> and connecting a crypto wallet.</p>
<p>1 GBTC presently costs $1.1062, with the price due to rise in a little over six days.</p>
<p>There are still a few weeks left of the presale, and the token could rally sharply by the time it’s listed on major exchanges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LootRush, a blockchain start-up backed by venture capital firms Paradigm and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) is announcing a new gaming subscription which <a href="https://www.lootrush.com/games/axie-infinity">allows its users to access non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a> from over 500 games on its platform from today.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based LootRush was launched in May 2022 and is a crypto gaming platform that allows users to enjoy any game through NFT rentals.</p>
<p>In an announcement, LootRush said through its new subscription its users will be able to access NFTs that are not in its inventory. Other perks include rental discounts, and premium support via Discord.</p>
<p>The game allows NFT holders to monetize their assets on the platform. LootRush supports multiple blockchains, including Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet, Ronin, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Coinbase&#8217;s Base network, and Polygon.</p>
<p>&#8220;A standout feature of LootRush subscriptions is the flexibility it affords users, allowing them to request almost any NFT and have it available for gameplay within 24 hours. This ensures a diverse gaming experience, even with rare or less readily available assets. &#8221; said Anderson Ferminiano, LootRush&#8217;s CEO, in a press release.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Golden Ticket&#8217; Allows Users to Try a &#8216;Bunch of Games&#8217;</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The new subscription is described as a &#8216;golden ticket&#8217; by the CEO, allowing LootRush gamers to try out various games. The pricing is split in three tiers starting at <span>$15 a month. </span></p>
<p><span>The first tier provides subscribers with up to $250 off fees and up to $100 in monthly NFT request credits, aimed at the casual gamers looking to explore the world of web3 gaming.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Think of our subscription as a golden ticket to let you try out a bunch of games, using special game pieces, without having to buy them one by one,&#8221; said Ferminiano.</span></p>
<h2>Gaming Revenue to Grow in 2024</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>It is estimated that total gaming revenue globally will rise from $227 billion in 2023 to $312 billion in 2027, according to a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/tmt/media/outlook/insights-and-perspectives.html">report by PwC</a>.</span></p>
<p>Last week, the <span>Australian venture capital firm King River Capital, blockchain gaming firm Immutable and Polygon Labs announced they had <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/king-river-capital-immutable-and-polygon-labs-launch-100m-gaming-fund.htm">teamed up to launch a $100 million fund</a> dedicated to gaming. </span></p>
<p><span>In 2023, it is estimated that the <a href="https://www.blockchaingamer.biz/features/29690/1700000000-invested-blockchain-gaming-2023/">blockchain gaming related rounds reached $1.7 billion</a>. Data from Messari, a crypto market intelligence firm, it is estimated that the </span><a href="https://resources.messari.io/pdf/crypto-theses-for-2024.pdf">combined market share of Immutable and Polygon Labs</a><span> is to be 70% of total blockchain gaming development, following a significant growth year for the entire industry.</span></p>
