<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, BlockDAG stands out with its presale success and innovative technology. While Cardano focuses on enhancing its blockchain utility for Web3 and Theta Network navigates market volatility, <a href="https://blockdag.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlockDAG Presale</a> has captured attention with its rapid presale progress and unique offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, in its fourth presale batch, BDAG coins are selling quickly at $0.0025 each, with a 50% price increase expected in the next batch. With over $7.3 million raised so far, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a top investment opportunity for 2024, offering practical solutions for everyday blockchain use.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cardano&#8217;s Progressive Leap into Web3</strong></h2>



<p>In its journey to strengthen the Web3 ecosystem,<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/23/chainlink-surpassed-cardano-secured-top-rank-as-dev-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Cardano</a>, via EMURGO&#8217;s investment in NMKR, is making calculated strides to enhance its blockchain utility. This move aims to broaden Cardano&#8217;s tokenization capabilities, cementing its status in the blockchain domain.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://blockdag.network/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="128" src="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-338-1024x128.png" alt=" BlockDAG " class="wp-image-198230" style="width:864px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-338-1024x128.png 1024w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-338-300x38.png 300w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-338-768x96.png 768w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-338-1536x192.png 1536w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-338-750x94.png 750w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-338-1140x143.png 1140w, https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-338.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>Cardano&#8217;s methodology is thoughtful and deliberate, focusing on reinforcing its infrastructure to promote sustained growth within its ecosystem. This strategy is not just about dominating the market; it&#8217;s about fostering a resilient, multifaceted blockchain environment, showcasing Cardano&#8217;s long-term vision beyond market conquest.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Theta&#8217;s Market Dynamics: An Uneven Terrain</strong></h2>



<p>The recent surge in <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/11/23/theta-price-prediction-theta-network-price-ready-for-1-breakout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Theta Network</a>&#8216;s price reflects growing investor confidence in its potential. This rise suggests trust in its technology for decentralized content delivery. However, trading volumes have declined, indicating investor caution. These trends highlight cryptocurrency market volatility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rising prices show optimism, but lower trading activity signals prudence, perhaps awaiting further developments. This cautious approach acknowledges crypto investment risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Theta Network&#8217;s resilience is vital, needing to adapt to market dynamics. Its response to technological advancements and market pressures will determine its success. Strategic partnerships, innovative upgrades, and community engagement are key. Theta&#8217;s ability to navigate fluctuations will maintain and expand its influence in the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BlockDAG Presale: The Rapid Sell Out Sparks FOMO&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>BlockDAG is making waves in the crypto world through its bold marketing strategies and groundbreaking technological advancements. A significant highlight was its mesmerizing presentation on a billboard at Tokyo&#8217;s iconic Shibuya Crossing, where it showcased its blockchain solutions to a diverse audience, marking a strategic step towards solidifying its market presence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently,<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/23/blockdags-stunning-6-8m-presale-victory-runes-rise-xrp-volume-also-spike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> BlockDAG </a>is in the midst of its fourth presale batch, with BDAG coins being offered at an attractive price of $0.0025. The presale has seen rapid sales, with 250 million out of the available 800 million coins already sold in a matter of hours. Investors should be aware that as the presale moves to batch 5, the price will escalate by 50% to $0.003. So far, the presale has amassed over $7.3 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an impressive rapid sale of over 3800 miners, BlockDAG&#8217;s debut has sparked considerable interest among investors, positioning it as a top investment opportunity for 2024. This enthusiasm is further fueled by an enticing $2 million giveaway, fostering community involvement and amplifying the brand&#8217;s visibility.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking Ahead with BlockDAG</strong></h2>



<p>While Cardano and Theta Network each bring their own strengths to the blockchain landscape, BlockDAG emerges as a standout contender with its swift presale progress and innovative technological offerings. As it moves into its fifth presale batch, the anticipation surrounding BDAG coins continues to grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a focus on integrating cryptocurrency into daily life through user-friendly solutions like crypto payment cards and X-series mining rigs, BlockDAG is not just making waves in the crypto market but also paving the way for a more accessible and practical blockchain future.&nbsp;</p>

It has a monthly return ratio of -80.10% and -97.90% on a yearly basis. Analysts are neutral and suggest the DRIP price may face a selloff and may soon retest the demand zone of $0.01200.</p>



<p>The DRIP token price has retested the neckline support zone of $0.01300 multiple times and has succeeded in acquiring a bounce. However, the 100-day EMA mark acted as a major rejection zone for the past weeks and persisted in trading below it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DRIP price is trading below the key moving averages and depicts a downtrend on the charts. Despite the range breakout, the token did not extend the bullish waves and has witnessed a trap, which led to a massive down move of over 45% this month.</p>

<p><em><strong>The introduction of spot ETF has facilitated the process of investing, and the recent approval of Bitcoin spot ETF has created options for small investors to hold the crypto as per their needs. </strong></em></p>



<p>Galaxy Digital’s analyst,&nbsp; Alex Thorn, has voiced his doubts over the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in May.</p>



<p>The analyst believes that there is reason for concern over the approval due to the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) lack of involvement with ETF applicants and recent subpoenas to cryptocurrency companies about their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation.</p>



<p>This week, Fortune cited American businesses that had been served subpoenas in connection with an inquiry that the SEC was &#8220;waging an energetic legal campaign&#8221; to categorize ETH as security.</p>



<p>The analyst stated that any enforcement action against the <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/23/is-march-31-the-deadline-for-the-sec-to-approve-ethereum-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum </a>Foundation after almost ten years would be &#8220;highly unregulated.&#8221; Still, the SEC may discern between the ICO and the current secondary trading of ETH.</p>



<p>Chairman of the SEC Gary Gensler remained silent when asked if the organization views ETH as a security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to information, the SEC is considering Ethereum&#8217;s 2022 &#8220;Merge&#8221; update, which will change the network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, as a factor that might make ETH more likely to be classified as a security.</p>



<p>In the case of early approval of Ethereum spot ETF, the price of ETH might surge by over $4,000. The recently approved Bitcoin spot ETF has directed an injection of more than $10 Billion just days after approval.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ETH Weeks Price Movement&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Ethereum is considered one of the market&#8217;s most prominent crypto in terms of market capitalization. Since March 25, 2023, till March 23, 2024, its prices have flourished 93.96%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dozens of market observers claim Ethereum is one of the most trustworthy crypto after Bitcoin. In the past 24 hours, the trading volume of ETH slipped by 14.23%, and the market cap grew by 2.85%.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Market Price Update&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The crypto market capitalization surged more than 2.99% in the past 24 hours; it was $2.47 Trillion when writing. Earlier this week, the market capitalization was flourishing at its verge and was on the brink of breaking the $3 Trillion milestone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has added 3.28% to its trading price intraday; when writing, it was trading at $65,219, with a decline of 14% in its trading volume.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethereum, the second most prominent crypto in the market, grew 2.92% in the past 24 hours, with a decline of 8.20% in its trading volume.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Analysts claim that the investigation on the Ethereum foundation is the cause of the decline. The ETH ETFs are yet to be approved. Ether spot ETF might get a regulatory green signal in May 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Toncoin and Bitcoin Cash are competing for the topper position of the intraday gainer&#8217;s list; Gala price grew 15.28%, Worldcoin 11.56%, Dogecoin 10.82%, and Floki 9.37%.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Following the constant popularity of cryptocurrencies, dozens of nations have already constituted their rules to regulate digital assets. The European Union has developed a set of regulations that will help to govern cryptocurrencies. </strong></em></p>



<p>Following the introduction of new anti-money laundering (AML) laws, the European Union (EU) is leading the fight against money laundering. The EU Parliament&#8217;s leading commission enacted a regulation that targets cryptocurrency and cash transactions.</p>



<p>Cash usage is restricted under the new rules. Any cash transaction above €3,000 will not be permitted, and any cash payment exceeding €10,000 will be limited. It&#8217;s also forbidden to use anonymous wallets to make Bitcoin payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Payments with cryptocurrencies are arguably the most controversial part of the new AML package. The new legislation will prohibit any cryptocurrency payments conducted with anonymous self-custody wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It applies to any digital wallet not run by a licensed provider, whether browser-based, desktop, or mobile.</p>



<p>Within three years of its formal going into effect, these new AML legislation will be enforced. Dillon Eustace, a Dublin legal practice, believes these regulations will fully function well before the usual enforcement timeframe.</p>

<p>The ShibaDoge crypto is on a four-day losing streak and is continuing its move toward the south on Saturday. The bears seem to be strong at the moment, as the price has made a breakdown below the 20-day exponential moving average.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SHIBDOGE crypto experienced a short-term bull run in the 1st week of March 2024 and surged 130% a week. The short-term gain triggered a profit booking among the short-term traders and Investors, and the price dropped.</p>



<p>The 20-day EMA acted as a dynamic support and tried to halt the further decline. The bulls could not hold more, and the crypto broke down after witnessing a short-term consolidation near it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bears seem to have won the short-term trend control as the price has broken below the 20 EMA. The price is headed towards the 50-day EMA at $0.000159. On the lower side, the $0.00016 is the previous breakout zone, which may act as support and try to prevent further falls.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ShibaDoge Crypto Volume Analysis</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/NTAjDXp5Z9l60m3X07MrXuhqpL_fXlhIFWIhMHQFytrQSxhvBgROSUAb66n6IbO-0JZWGCP0YpjA2lHpWuiQ9q8ryvBOgSzCZNuO3m6EVBVIjwe6y786cDDxvGjPa9Thu97FVOgn9oUB8ZAac6z2De4" alt=""/></figure></div>


<p>The volume analysis shows that the <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2022/07/06/these-meme-coins-dominate-the-ethereum-whales-holdings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SHIBDOGE crypto</a> received $163.95 Million in the last 24 hours, which is 20% lower than the previous day&#8217;s volume. The decreasing volume indicates that crypto might lose momentum on the lower side. </p>



<p>Also, the volume to market capitalization is 3.25%. It has a live market capitalization of 5 Million USD and ranks 3427th in the overall crypto market.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SHIBDOGE Price Technical Analysis.</strong></h2>



<p>From a technical point of view, the SHIBDOGE cryptocurrency price dropped below the 20-day EMA, suggesting weakness in the short-term trend. However, on the lower side, the 50-day EMA may act as a dynamic support and prevent further falls. The long-term trend outlook remains positive as the crypto stays above the 200-day EMA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the MACD and signal lines have made a bearish crossover, suggesting a negative sentiment dominating the market.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ShibaDoge Crypto Trend Analysis</strong></h3>



<!-- TradingView Chart BEGIN -->

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/tv.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">

var tradingview_embed_options = {};

tradingview_embed_options.width = '980';

tradingview_embed_options.height = '425';

</script>

<p><a href="https://in.tradingview.com/chart/SHIBDOGE/WOIVtbEk-ShibaDoge-Crypto/"></a>  <a href="https://in.tradingview.com/u/Ritika_TCR/"></a> <a href="https://in.tradingview.com/"></a></p>

<!-- TradingView Chart END -->



<p>The short-term outlook has weakened after the breakdown below the 20-day EMA. However, the bulls may return near the higher EMAs of 50 days and try to regain control in the short term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, if the bulls can make a comeback near the previous breakout zone, the crypto may reverse its course toward the higher side. On the higher side, the short-term traders may target the recent swing high of $0.00023 as the 1st target if the price turns bullish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if the bulls cannot counter near the recent support and the bears can make a breakdown, it may validate the initiation of a correction phase, and the price may drop more.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The ShibaDoge price is on a four-day losing streak and has made a breakdown of 20-day EMA. The bears seem strong and intend to retrace the 50-day EMA. The technical indicators show weakness in the trend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the lower side, the 50-day EMA may act as dynamic support. If the bulls can make a comeback and the price reverses its course, more buying volume may be observed above the recent swing high.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if the bulls fail to receive and the price breaks below the 50-day EMA, it may invite more selling volumes, and the correction phase may continue.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technical levels:</strong></h4>



<ul>
<li>Support levels: $0.00016 and $0.00014</li>



<li>Resistance levels: $0.00019 and $0.00023</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Bitcoin and digital currency have strongly debuted and gathered millions of users; in some cases, cryptocurrencies have been used to support the declining nation&#8217;s economy. </strong></em></p>



<p>Since the past few months, the Argentine peso has slipped significantly, which gave birth to the growth of Bitcoin purchases in the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a report, Bloomberg noted that Lemon Cash, an Argentinan <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/02/28/cryptocurrency-exchange-whitebit-becomes-an-official-broker-on-tradingview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency exchange</a>, has sold Bitcoins to over 35,000 customers in the past week. It is crucial to note that El Salvador has legalized Bitcoin by introducing a Bitcoin Law.</p>



<p>Dozens of analysts also claim that the devaluation of the Argentine national currency majorly influences the spike in Bitcoin purchases. On March 23, 2023, 1 Argentine Peso was equal to $0.0049; however, as of writing, one peso was equal to $0.0012.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Argentine Peso has lost its 4x value over its price 52 weeks ago. Argentina got its official national currency in 1992, called the peso convertible. Lemon Cash and other leading cryptocurrency exchanges of the nation, Belo and Ripio, observed a similar growth pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement, Manuel Beaudroi, the CEO of the digital wallet Belo, urges that a massive decline in stablecoin trading and purchases is seen following the growing demand for Bitcoin in the nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The user decides to buy Bitcoin when they see the news that the currency is going up, while stablecoin is more pragmatic and many times used for transactional purposes, as a vehicle to make payments abroad.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beaudroi further claims that the trading volume of Ethereum and Bitcoin surged over 10 percent on Belo compared to a year ago. Several available reports also assure that the interest in buying stablecoin might grow in Argentina in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Market Price Update&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The crypto market capitalization has surged 1.01% in the past 24 hours; when writing, it was $2.47 Trillion. According to the data available from <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2022/04/30/ripples-xrp-is-categorized-as-just-a-impostor-cryptocurrency-by-coinmarketcap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinMarketCap</a>, the market cap fluctuated; earlier this month, it reached above $2.65 trillion. </p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price hasn&#8217;t shown any significant developments intraday; as of writing, it was trading at $64,497. Its trading volume has also formed a declining pattern and lost 14.42%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite positivity in market capitalization, Ethereum, the second most prominent cryptocurrency, slips 1.36% and falls to $3,352.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surged 13.26% in the past 24 hours, which makes the intraday gainers list topper. Toncoin price flourished at 11.68%, Gala at 11.05%, Worldcoin at 10.20%, Floki at 8.36%, Dogecoin at 8.29%, and eCash at 6.89%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the loser list is topped by Fantom (FTM) at 8.31%, Kaspa at 6.63%, Sui at 5.82%, Optimism at 4.48%, JasmyCoin at 3.43%, and Celestia at 3.30%. The memecoin community has flourished significantly, and Floki has emerged as the most traded memecoin in the past few months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Book of Meme (BOME) is among the trending coins in the market, followed by Panda Swap, Bitcoin, Meme Ai, and Ondo.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>The SEC is supposed to eye down on Ethereum ETFs as the regulator is ongoing legal action against Coinbase and Binance.</strong></em></p>



<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not want to undermine its discussions in continuing legal action against Binance and Coinbase. Scott Johnsson, a finance lawyer expressed his opinion on why the SEC may comfortably deny spot Ether (ETH) ETFs. He also discussed the launch of Ethereum foundations by the SEC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3 Theories why the SEC may disapprove Ethereum ETFs&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>As the days pass, crypto enthusiasts are waiting for the SEC’s final decision on spot Ether ETF. Based on the current news and scenarios, it is expected that the commission may comfortably deny the ETF and satisfy senator blowback.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On March 22, Scott Johnsson, the general partner of Van Buren Capital and finance lawyer came up with three theories that may allow the commission to deny the upcoming ETF approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, Johnsson also discussed the SEC’s probe into Ethereum and the launch of the Ethereum foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the Fortune report on March 20, the investigation by the commission into the Ethereum foundation could help the regulatory coverage to define ETH as a security. Additionally, in 2022, the commission has organized a campaign to categorize ETH as a security following the blockchain’s transformation from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).</p>



<p>According to Johnsson, the commission could be considering the probe to calm crypto skeptics who have demanded a strict stance from the agency. Recently, Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler, democrat senators requested the commission not to permit any further crypto ETFs.</p>



<p>Another factor is the need for a non-correlation objection to deny the<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/11/22/the-best-cryptos-to-buy-ahead-of-btc-eth-etfs-dont-miss-out-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ETH ETFs</a> and the commission may use this way to reject ETFs as the non-correlation objects may not hold up. However, denying ETH on correlation analysis may result in a temporary solution as the correlation levels are continuously advancing over time, said Johnsson.  </p>



<p>According to Johnsson, the probe is another factor that could push the SEC to deny the spot ETH ETFs. The ongoing investigation will help the commission deny the ETF approval as well as take legal action against Coinbase and Binance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The commission charged both exchanges for offering unregistered securities including 19 tokens. Nonetheless, the token list doesn’t include Ethereum. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer responded to the Ethereum probe.</p>



<p>“The SEC has no good reason to deny the ETH ETP applications,” Grewal added.</p>



<p>Furthermore, SEC chairman Gary Gensler has denied answering any queries about ETH’s qualification as a security asset or spot ETF approval.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>About Ethereum ETFs</strong></h2>



<p>Ethereum Exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial tool mainly constructed to deliver exposure to ETF. It tracks the market price of the digital asset and permits investors exposure to the asset without actual purchase.</p>



<p>It also helps in mitigating threats and improving returns by applying investment across different asset classes. The commission delayed the decision on ETH Exchange-traded funds and is supposed to make the final decision on May 23, 2024.<br></p>
