<p><em><strong>ERC-404 is a protocol created by the Pandora team and combines the features of two different token standards.</strong></em></p>



<p>The rain of innovations and inventions in cryptocurrency is endless, delivering efficient and effective services. In continuation, a new hybrid token standard with in-build capacity for fractional trading, ERC-404, is gaining pace in the crypto market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s explore the facts and features of the new hybrid token standard.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is ERC-404?</strong></h2>



<p>Projected on February 5, 2024, as a Pandora, the ERC-404 appeared as an experimental token standard within the Ethereum ecosystem. The token standard is a mixture of one fungible token, ERC-20, and one non-fungible token, ERC-721.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The token standard was launched recently but still needs to be officially announced as the token has yet to undergo the formal Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process. Ethereum developers do not audit the token but are gaining popularity among crypto enthusiasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The token standard is streaming on the Ethereum mainnet and is supposed to expand its roots on other networks, including Arbitrum.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/uk9deR_Jk1t5jR3oqqZwO3k7E0v2CawLjad5L8Cjol_NdkXeJ_W21O9iZH_6GNEOAPjSBEgBwCoVE18R8iMZcczc5ISPDl_PdBJFUar_POR1083iAen4voqOVyBeKnfhNe5Tc3RHItKzoZO0qPnOxXg" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Source: </strong>Pandora Website </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Hybrid functionality, fractionalization, native liquidity, and programmable scarcity are some features that make the hybrid token a strong player in the market. The token can adjust through code, opening doors for innovative tokenomics models.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Token Standard Complete Working&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Despite being unofficial, the complete ownership of the hybrid token standard triggers the bonuses of an NFT. Also, the NFT is automatically burned when the token is sold. The mechanism thus helps traders make trades with both fungible and non-fungible tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The token mint and burn approach thus enables fractional transfers of an <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/18/nodemonkes-nft-grew-over-35-intraday-bayc-still-the-topper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFT</a>, making trading more effortless for the crypto fans.   </p>



<p>Moreover, the tokens are connected to the NFTs, and buying an entire token mints the linked NFT in the buyer&#8217;s wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hybrid token standard also considers various factors, including safety, project leveraging, and influence on Ethereum price. It is identified that the token&#8217;s impact on the ETH price is limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Projects Employing the Hybrid Token Standard&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Streaming in the Ethereum ecosystem, the hybrid token standard operates with projects including Pandora, DeFrogs, and Monkees.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pandora: </strong>Pandora is the first-ever project to operate the new token standard and holds around 10K PANDORA tokens and 10K linked NFTs. Purchasing a PANDORA token from any exchange results in minting an NFT in the wallet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>DeFrogs: </strong>Another powerful project using the new hybrid token standard is DeFrogs, a collection of 10K Pepe NFTs. Like Pandora, the project mints NFT in buyers&#8217; wallets when purchasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Monkees: </strong>Monkees is another profile picture-based NFT project that employs the new token standard. The project holds over 100 NFTs with six traits and ten attributes, permitting users to operate with the new token standard.</p>



<p>As the token has not been submitted for EIP, most NFT marketplaces and projects do not support it. Despite these, the token standard catalyzed Pandora, helping it hit over $32,000 weekly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pandora And The Token Standard Story&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Pandora is an ERC-404 token standard that combines digital assets with NFTs to make trading more efficient. The project was introduced to the crypto world in early 2024 to deliver liquidity to the NFT space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it is the first project to adopt the hybrid token standard. However, the new token standard acted as a lucky charm for the project and raised the PANDORA price to over $32,000 within a week.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/uZPOrYTYQ4gcss0lxxfP9jTepEkYzratzBvzrGStogYo18Sh1p4giFYgzMmFELx6v3d08KBq93YZCoqMiKsZhokvDfUMvoWHeN91487_Xq71Kh0COTZyF6gc_-oGUejmcQRqkIju8HFFG6NfY7f4ExI" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Source:</strong> CoinGecko </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>On February 9, 2024, the PANDORA token’s all-time high price of $32,000 was recorded, whereas an all-time low of $1,542.25 was measured on February 5. The token has a maximum supply of 10K PANDORA, and the circulating supply is 10K.    </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The experimental token standard is outstanding in the crypto world, helping the PANDORA token hit its all-time high of $32,000. The new standard token is being used with some NFT projects, including Pandora, DeFrogs, and Monkees. The unofficial token holds compelling features, including Hybrid functionality, native liquidity, and programmable scarcity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FAQs</strong></h3>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the circulating supply of Pandora?</strong></h4>



<p>The circulating supply of Pandora tokens is 10K, and the total supply is 10K.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the different types of ERC tokens?</strong></h4>



<p>The token standard includes ERC20, 721, 1155, and 404. However, the 404 token standard is unofficial and in the experimental phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Features Made BscScan a Standout Performer&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The BSC-based blockchain explorer delivers some outstanding features to sustain its strong and recognized positioning in the world of analytics.</p>

Clicking the option displays average gas prices, block size, and average utilization. Individuals can also check the opt gas guzzlers and spenders that help make infrared decisions. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Transaction check: </strong>To check transactions over the platform, the user must search for the transaction hash or wallet address. The page offers an in-detailed description of the transaction amount, balances, status, transaction fees, date, and block number.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>AtomicHub offers a platform to create NFTs effortlessly. It makes collections, schemes, templates and helps to develop new NFT collections on the platform. </strong></em></p>



<p>Despite the shaking waves in the <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/18/rarible-nft-marketplace-allows-royalties-to-owners-on-resale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFT marketplace</a>, the craze for NFT is not decreasing. The NFT fans are exploring new ways to create, buy, sell, and trade NFTs. One such platform that offers an effortless path to create, analyze, and trade NFTs is AtomicHub. It allows users to design unique original NFTs. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is AtomicHub?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>AtomicHub is an NFT marketplace created on the Electro-Optical System (EOS) and WAX blockchain. The platform allows individuals to list NFTs with AtomicAssets standards and deliver facilities like exploring, buying, and selling NFTs.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MD1c9GlRlneh5ERMKxTe862XiyDA1yfYKtTnx7uLsuChSJVr26OsytdPq4HCjNu0W5msfH4AZiqKBxla5SaU7GXlYZnzNdmAbEBuRpX_nJ1jRg3C5oi3UAuvxRvV91_zUdllSVOksoB4xjG6SIZhVBI" alt="AtomicHub"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Source: </strong>AtomicHub Website   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Interestingly, the platform permits individuals to create NFTs without holding a grip on technical terms and coding. The NFT marketplace operations are mainly divided into four types and are as follows:</p>



<p>Explorer: The explorer feature helps users search for all the existing NFTs in the marketplace. The section offers trend charts, total assets, stats, and templates. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Trading: </strong>The Trading feature helps check inventory and swap simple assets NFT to AtomicAsset.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>NFT Creator: </strong>The NFT Creator feature helps individuals create and deliver Atomic assets standard NFT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Market: </strong>The NFT marketplace helps buy, sell, and list assets. Sales, auctions, and history are other services offered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Steps to Create NFT on AtomicHub </strong></h2>



<p>To create NFT on the NFT marketplace, users must sign up and create a wallet where the created NFTs are stored. Wax Cloud Wallet, Anchor, and Scatter are the three leading wallets supported by the respective NFT marketplace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once done, the following process is to collect resources to smoothly carry out the NFT creation process. RAM can be purchased by entering the My Collection option and hitting the Buy More tab. Entering the amount of WAX tokens individuals wish to spend buying RAM will help accomplish the process.</p>



<p>Now, the user is ready to prepare a unique NFT collection to list on the NFT marketplace. Let’s explore the steps involved in NFT creation on the NFT platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Hitting the “Create New Collection” in the My Collection is the first step of creating a unique NFT collection on the respective NFT marketplace. Further, the creator must enter specific details, including collection name, display name, website URL, collection description, and market fee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, the collection name should not be less or greater than 12 characters and should not include upper case and special characters. Additionally, the market fee should range between 0-6%. Filling out the mandatory fields is essential for proceeding further and can be modified as needed. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>The next step is to Create a Schema, which is available at the bottom of the page and defines the characteristics of the asset. Here, the creator must fill in a few details, including Schema Name and Attribute name and type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, the creator receives two predefined attributes with images and header names and can add more by hitting the Add New Attribute button. Remember that an individual can add new attributes but can’t modify the already created attribute. So, carry out the process carefully, and once done, the Schema name will appear in the collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>The next step is creating a template available on the Schema page under Mint New NFT. The template helps save resources and time and requires filling in a few details, including image addition, setting maximum supply, turning on/off asset transfer, and burn option.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Confirming the process by hitting the Create Template will help creators reach the next Mint NFT step. &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Mint NFT is the final stage and requires filling in details such as NFT owner, number of copies, and Template. Here, the Template option is optional, and the creator can select the existing template from the dropdown table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once done, hit Create Asset, and verifying the mint summary will help complete the process. Here, the creator finds five copies of NFTs in the NFT field. Clicking on the “Create Asset” option will help finalize the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, exploring the NFT collection and selecting a particular NFT will help you buy the NFT.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Latest Updates and Release&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a paradigm shift with the advent of innovative mechanisms like the<a href="https://blockdag.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> BlockDAG network</a>, challenging the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) predictions and the meme-inspired Shiba Inu (SHIB) price. This comparative exploration aims to shed light on how BlockDAG&#8217;s decentralized architecture offers the potential to deliver up to 10,000x returns, creating a buzz among investors eyeing the next big crypto in 2024. Let&#8217;s delve into the dynamics of SHIB, Bitcoin Cash, and the emerging star, BlockDAG, to understand where the real investment goldmine lies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shiba Inu Price Performance</strong></h2>



<p>The SHIB price is currently navigating a challenging phase, evidenced by a persistent downtrend captured within a descending trendline. The SHIB’s price finds itself teetering just above a critical support line, struggling to maintain its footing. The relative strength index (RSI) is lingering below the median level of 50 signaling the prevalence of a bearish sentiment, a sentiment barely contested by a marginally optimistic Awesome Oscillator (AO). Given this market posture, the SHIB price is at risk of descending to the 0.000024 support level, as indicated by the Fibonacci retracement tool, potentially marking a 10% decline from its current position before any sign of a recovery rally emerges.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Cash: Riding the Wave of Optimism</strong></h2>



<p>A bullish momentum is witnessed during the <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/20/bitcoin-cash-uniswap-investors-attracted-to-new-koala-coin-for-remarkable-growth/">Bitcoin cash</a> predictions, breaking out of an ascending triangle pattern and eyeing the $300 resistance level. However, significant supply at this crucial juncture presents a formidable challenge, suggesting potential price consolidation. Amidst growing enthusiasm in the crypto market, bolstered by positive developments for Bitcoin, BCH&#8217;s trading volume has surged. This upswing, coupled with bullish market sentiment, fuels optimistic Bitcoin Cash predictions, positioning BCH for a notable ascent in 2024.</p>

<p><em><strong>Token farming and yielding are the most popular opportunities for generating yields in the global DeFi marketspace.</strong></em></p>



<p>DeFi Yield Farming has become the most popular method to earn passive income with cryptocurrency. Yield farming can be considered a risk-free investment strategy for users to put their tokens to work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the rules surrounding yield farming change often and there are numerous risks involved. The rewards are generally enough to incentivize people to stake their tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yielding token farms in two steps:</p>



<p>For this yield farming strategy, a user needs to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Get liquidity pool (LP) tokens</li>



<li>Deposit those LP tokens into a farm</li>
</ul>



<p>If a user knows what LP tokens are, it is important to understand how to get them and deposit them into a farm. This article talks about the details of the yield farming strategy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to Yield Token Farm?</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Get Liquidity Pool Tokens</h3>



<p>It straightaway adds liquidity to a DEX. For farming, in addition to considering the APY on the various pools, the DEX offers. It will also consider which LP tokens are accepted for farming and what the APY is for the farm.</p>



<p>Once the user identifies a pool, they start depositing the specified crypto assets into the pool. The user will receive LP tokens, which will be deposited into the farm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Deposit Liquidity pool tokens in a farm</h3>



<p>Once a user has the accepted LP tokens that are accepted in a farm, they can deposit them in the farm to start earning additional rewards.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Requirements to yield a token farm of DEX</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Digital Wallet</h3>



<p>These wallets are also known as crypto wallets or Web3 wallets. It holds cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Self-custodial wallets are considered to be the best among all the available options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Self-custody wallets allow users to have complete control over the components of their wallets. Whereas, in a custodial wallet, a third party has complete control.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cryptocurrency</h3>



<p>The wallets need to contain cryptocurrency to pay for transaction fees. These fees are used to pay for actions that make changes to a blockchain. It needs to be paid in the blockchain’s native currency.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">LP tokens</h3>



<p>To yield a farm on a <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/02/16/what-is-omnichain-is-it-the-future-of-decentralized-exchange/">decentralized exchange</a>, a user will also need certain cryptographic assets in the decentralized exchange required for token farming. These are the liquidity pool tokens that a user obtains by first depositing equal amounts of two cryptocurrencies in a specific liquidity pool on the DEX.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Decentralized Exchange Platform</h3>



<p>It is important to use a renowned DEX site that enables several liquid markets, where a third-party security firm has audited the protocol and the farming rewards are sustainable and attractive.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding Liquidity Pool Tokens</strong></h2>



<p>Liquidity pool tokens are an important component of decentralized exchanges. Trading on DEX is facilitated by people adding liquidity to trading pairs. Anyone is allowed to add a crypto asset trading pair to a DEX or increase the strength of an existing trading pair by providing liquidity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not possible to have smooth functioning without enough liquidity on the platform, so DEX encourages users to add liquidity by giving a part of the DEX fees to liquidity providers.</p>



<p>Every DEX trading pair has its own pool of liquidity. These are known as pools or sometimes liquidity pools. Liquidity providers on pools earn a proportional share of 0.25% of the total volume of assets swapped with people who trade between the assets in the pool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A dynamic APY displays the earnings for liquidity providers. When a user deposits cryptocurrencies into a liquidity pool, the smart contract mints and sends a token that is a kind of receipt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This token is known as the liquidity pool (LP) token, also sometimes called a liquidity provider token. It is used to realize any outstanding rewards from your position and to withdraw users’ deposited crypto assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding Farms</strong></h2>



<p>DEX incentivizes people to add liquidity by giving a portion of the DEX fees to liquidity providers. Farms are a method to further incentivize liquidity providers by offering additional rewards. They work in a way that liquidity providers deposit their LP tokens into a farm, which is a smart contract collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While those LP tokens on the farm are entitled to the holders to earn additional rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Farming Rewards and their Source</strong></h2>



<p>Mostly, farming rewards are paid in the native token of the chosen DEX and the supply comes from the token’s outstanding supply. The operators of the DEX fix the APY for farming rewards, which LP tokens are eligible for farming rewards, and it also specifies the time frame for which the farming rewards will be available.</p>



<p>Some DEX have previously offered high APYs for farming, beyond 1000%. It is an attempt to attract a high amount of liquidity and attention to the DEX. These high rewards are unsustainable, as the rewards are paid in the native DEX token.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high APYs are very likely to attract so-called liquidity providers. These are participants who sacrifice their farming reward and immediately withdraw their liquidity the moment the farming rewards are evaporated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This reduces the liquidity of DEX and the DEX’s token without value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion: Calculation and Distribution of Rewards</strong></h3>



<p>These farm token rewards are allocated to individual users based on their proportion of LP tokens deposited in the farm and the time those LP tokens are kept in the farm.</p>



<p>The APY is estimated using a model that depends on distribution periods. This estimation generally assumes that 100% of the liquidity providers for the given pool for which they have deposited their LP tokens are in the farm for the duration of the distribution period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The liquidity providers who have deposited their LP tokens in the farm receive a higher APY than estimated. If the liquidity is increased during the time tokens were deposited in the pool, then the APY will be temporarily lower than estimated.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FAQs</strong></h4>



<p>What is the lockup period when depositing tokens at the yield farms?</p>



<p>It does not have a lockup period.</p>



<p>What is the best way to claim rewards?</p>



<p>In some cases, a user can withdraw LP tokens to claim rewards. And in other, LP tokens in the farm and claim rewards whenever a user wants.</p>

<p><em><strong>London Stock Exchange has announced acceptance of applications for the approval of ETNs in the regulated market.</strong></em></p>



<p>Exchange Traded-Notes (ETNs) are types of unsecured debt securities that track an underlying index of securities and trade like stocks on major crypto exchanges. ETNs are like bonds without interest payments and their prices fluctuate like stocks.</p>



<p>These ETN values will rise and fall in line with the underlying crypto assets, subject to the deduction of fees and expenses. It gives investors exposure to the changing value of underlying crypto assets without critically holding the crypto assets themselves.</p>



<p>It appeals to investors who do not wish to invest directly in crypto assets, manage wallets or transact on unregulated crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>The crypto exchange-traded notes have gained popularity in recent years, with a steadily increasing range of features and underlying crypto assets being introduced in the market.</p>



<p>The performance and movements of most crypto assets are volatile; however, the stance on ETNs changed with the approval of the spot BTC ETF in the USA.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applications for Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded notes</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/10/02/london-stock-exchanges-blockchain-revolution-in-traditional-asset-trading/">London Stock Exchange</a> (LSE) announced that it will start accepting applications for Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in the second quarter of 2024. </p>



<p>The crypto ETN Admission Factsheet outlines the requirements for these products, and LSE has released the details. The processed ETNs for review need to be backed by Bitcoin or Ether. These products further need to be unleveraged and should have a publicly available market price or value measure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the London Stock Exchange has not announced the exact date for accepting applications. No major financial institutions have confirmed whether they will be applying for ETNs or not. They might respond once LSE opens the acceptance of applications.</p>



<p>As per the submitted factsheet, the underlying crypto assets must be “principally or wholly” stored in cold wallets or similar storage by custodians following Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, or the United States.</p>



<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stated it will not contradict Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) building market segments for crypto-backed exchange-traded notes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The regulator signified that these products are aimed at professional investors, such as credit institutions and investment firms authorized or regulated to function in financial markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ETFs for Bitcoin have already been introduced and Ethereum ETFs are under approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Amid all these developments of products, Bitcoin and Ether ETNs are a new category and may open up new opportunities for investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Comparing ETNs and ETFs</strong></h2>



<p>Exchange-traded notes, abbreviated as ETNs, are unsecured debt securities that track their values from an underlying index and trade on major exchanges like stocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial institutions issue ETNs with a maturity date, and the repayment of the principal depends on the issuer’s financial viability. However, ETN does not make periodical interest payments but rather provides returns based on the performance of the underlying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>US-based financial services firm, Fidelity Investments, has shared advice with the investments for comparing ETFs or ETNs, stating,</p>



<p><em>“The decision of whether to opt for an ETF or ETN in the same product area depends largely on your investment time frame. Given that ETFs are subject to yearly capital gain and income distributions which are taxable events to the holder—and ETNs are not—it seems reasonable to conclude that ETNs are a superior product for the long-term investor.”</em></p>



<p>Fidelity Investments has said that ETNs may be considered an ironic investment because of the way they offer tax advantages. However, they also witness a significant risk as they provide access to more niche product areas, which are not recommended as staples for long-term investors.</p>



<p>ETFs and ETNs both track underlying benchmarks and trade on exchanges. They have multiple differences. ETFs are similar to mutual funds in that they facilitate asset holdings, including stocks or commodities. These assets derive the prices of ETFs.</p>



<p>Investment in the ETF allows ownership of a diversified asset block. Whereas ETNs are debt securities that guarantee to pay the index’s value at maturity, excluding fees. It exposes investors to the risks related to issuers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advantages of ETFs over ETNs</strong></h2>



<p>ETFs offer several advantages over ETNs, such as greater tax efficiency, as taxes are only charged upon sale. ETFs provide instant diversification by dividing the total investments into a basket of assets, reducing unsystematic risk for investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their expense ratio is also lower in comparison to actively managed mutual funds, making them cost-effective. Dividends in ETFs are also reinvested immediately and they offer liquidity and flexibility for trading. Further, ETFs have lower tracking errors than ETNs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advantages of ETNs over ETFs</strong></h2>



<p>In contrast, ETNs are preferred for investors who want exposure to specific indices or assets not available through investments in ETFs.</p>



<p>ETNs are highly tax-efficient for specific strategies, including short-term trading, as taxes are incurred only upon sale. However, ETNs expose investments to credit risk tied to the issuer’s financial stability, which an investor should consider.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion: Development of Crypto ETN</strong></h3>



<p>The introduction of crypto ETNs on the London Stock Exchange will have both positive and negative implications for the crypto landscape. It depends on one’s perspective on decentralization and regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The development of crypto ETNs and their adoption by major financial institutions mark steps towards the mainstream adoption and legitimization of cryptocurrencies. It will attract more institutional investors to the crypto market. This mode will also be a safer and more accessible entrance for investors who are hesitant to invest directly in cryptographic assets.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FAQs</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is increasing adoption in the crypto space?</p>



<p>The involvement of traditional financial institutions in the crypto markets is attracting more investors to the space.</p>



<p><strong>Q.</strong> Will ETNs increase regulation on the crypto market?</p>



<p>These will bring crypto assets under the regulatory framework.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/12/19/xdc-network-will-the-xdc-price-show-range-expansion-in-jan-2024/">XDC price</a> forecast suggests that XDC crypto has the potential to smash the upper levels and break the upper trendline of the channel. Currently, XDC cryptocurrency is waiting for a solid upward momentum to move towards the bullish phase on the daily chart.</p>

<p><strong>XDC Crypto Price vs Volume Analysis</strong></p>

<p>The volume and price graph displayed that the trading volume has increased from $8.05 Million to $24.96 Million in the last few days and the price has also increased. In the last few days, the price has increased from $0.043 to $0.046. The price is expected to bounce back in the short term.</p>



<p><strong>XDC Crypto Social Dominance vs Social Volume</strong></p>



<iframe loading="lazy" title="Santiment Chart: Price (XDC), Social Dominance (XDC), Social Volume (XDC)" width="1170" height="425" src="https://embed.santiment.net/chart?ps=xdc-network&#038;pt=XDC&#038;df=2023-12-21T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&#038;dt=2024-03-23T18%3A29%3A59.326Z&#038;sat=shchcfg_Dbi0BMeEwkga&#038;emcg=1&#038;emhwm=1&#038;wm=price_usd%3Bsocial_dominance_total%3Bsocial_volume_total&#038;wax=0%3B1%3B2&#038;wc=%233e9255%3B%23FF5B5B%3B%2368DBF4&#038;ws=%3B%7B%22interval%22%3A%221d%22%7D%3B%7B%22interval%22%3A%221d%22%7D" scrolling="no"></iframe>



<p>Based on the social dominance and social volume graph, the social dominance and social volume have been increasing for the last few months which has left a positive impact on the price.
