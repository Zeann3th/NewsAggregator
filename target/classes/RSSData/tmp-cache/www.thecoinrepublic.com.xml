<p>The cryptocurrency market is witnessing a paradigm shift with the advent of innovative mechanisms like the<a href="https://blockdag.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> BlockDAG network</a>, challenging the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) predictions and the meme-inspired Shiba Inu (SHIB) price. This comparative exploration aims to shed light on how BlockDAG&#8217;s decentralized architecture offers the potential to deliver up to 10,000x returns, creating a buzz among investors eyeing the next big crypto in 2024. Let&#8217;s delve into the dynamics of SHIB, Bitcoin Cash, and the emerging star, BlockDAG, to understand where the real investment goldmine lies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shiba Inu Price Performance</strong></h2>



<p>The SHIB price is currently navigating a challenging phase, evidenced by a persistent downtrend captured within a descending trendline. The SHIB’s price finds itself teetering just above a critical support line, struggling to maintain its footing. The relative strength index (RSI) is lingering below the median level of 50 signaling the prevalence of a bearish sentiment, a sentiment barely contested by a marginally optimistic Awesome Oscillator (AO). Given this market posture, the SHIB price is at risk of descending to the 0.000024 support level, as indicated by the Fibonacci retracement tool, potentially marking a 10% decline from its current position before any sign of a recovery rally emerges.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Cash: Riding the Wave of Optimism</strong></h2>



<p>A bullish momentum is witnessed during the <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/20/bitcoin-cash-uniswap-investors-attracted-to-new-koala-coin-for-remarkable-growth/">Bitcoin cash</a> predictions, breaking out of an ascending triangle pattern and eyeing the $300 resistance level. However, significant supply at this crucial juncture presents a formidable challenge, suggesting potential price consolidation. Amidst growing enthusiasm in the crypto market, bolstered by positive developments for Bitcoin, BCH&#8217;s trading volume has surged. This upswing, coupled with bullish market sentiment, fuels optimistic Bitcoin Cash predictions, positioning BCH for a notable ascent in 2024.</p>

<p><em><strong>Token farming and yielding are the most popular opportunities for generating yields in the global DeFi marketspace.</strong></em></p>



<p>DeFi Yield Farming has become the most popular method to earn passive income with cryptocurrency. Yield farming can be considered a risk-free investment strategy for users to put their tokens to work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the rules surrounding yield farming change often and there are numerous risks involved. The rewards are generally enough to incentivize people to stake their tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yielding token farms in two steps:</p>



<p>For this yield farming strategy, a user needs to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Get liquidity pool (LP) tokens</li>



<li>Deposit those LP tokens into a farm</li>
</ul>



<p>If a user knows what LP tokens are, it is important to understand how to get them and deposit them into a farm. This article talks about the details of the yield farming strategy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to Yield Token Farm?</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Get Liquidity Pool Tokens</h3>



<p>It straightaway adds liquidity to a DEX. For farming, in addition to considering the APY on the various pools, the DEX offers. It will also consider which LP tokens are accepted for farming and what the APY is for the farm.</p>



<p>Once the user identifies a pool, they start depositing the specified crypto assets into the pool. The user will receive LP tokens, which will be deposited into the farm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Deposit Liquidity pool tokens in a farm</h3>



<p>Once a user has the accepted LP tokens that are accepted in a farm, they can deposit them in the farm to start earning additional rewards.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Requirements to yield a token farm of DEX</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Digital Wallet</h3>



<p>These wallets are also known as crypto wallets or Web3 wallets. It holds cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Self-custodial wallets are considered to be the best among all the available options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Self-custody wallets allow users to have complete control over the components of their wallets. Whereas, in a custodial wallet, a third party has complete control.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cryptocurrency</h3>



<p>The wallets need to contain cryptocurrency to pay for transaction fees. These fees are used to pay for actions that make changes to a blockchain. It needs to be paid in the blockchain’s native currency.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">LP tokens</h3>



<p>To yield a farm on a <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/02/16/what-is-omnichain-is-it-the-future-of-decentralized-exchange/">decentralized exchange</a>, a user will also need certain cryptographic assets in the decentralized exchange required for token farming. These are the liquidity pool tokens that a user obtains by first depositing equal amounts of two cryptocurrencies in a specific liquidity pool on the DEX.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Decentralized Exchange Platform</h3>



<p>It is important to use a renowned DEX site that enables several liquid markets, where a third-party security firm has audited the protocol and the farming rewards are sustainable and attractive.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding Liquidity Pool Tokens</strong></h2>



<p>Liquidity pool tokens are an important component of decentralized exchanges. Trading on DEX is facilitated by people adding liquidity to trading pairs. Anyone is allowed to add a crypto asset trading pair to a DEX or increase the strength of an existing trading pair by providing liquidity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not possible to have smooth functioning without enough liquidity on the platform, so DEX encourages users to add liquidity by giving a part of the DEX fees to liquidity providers.</p>



<p>Every DEX trading pair has its own pool of liquidity. These are known as pools or sometimes liquidity pools. Liquidity providers on pools earn a proportional share of 0.25% of the total volume of assets swapped with people who trade between the assets in the pool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A dynamic APY displays the earnings for liquidity providers. When a user deposits cryptocurrencies into a liquidity pool, the smart contract mints and sends a token that is a kind of receipt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This token is known as the liquidity pool (LP) token, also sometimes called a liquidity provider token. It is used to realize any outstanding rewards from your position and to withdraw users’ deposited crypto assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding Farms</strong></h2>



<p>DEX incentivizes people to add liquidity by giving a portion of the DEX fees to liquidity providers. Farms are a method to further incentivize liquidity providers by offering additional rewards. They work in a way that liquidity providers deposit their LP tokens into a farm, which is a smart contract collection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While those LP tokens on the farm are entitled to the holders to earn additional rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Farming Rewards and their Source</strong></h2>



<p>Mostly, farming rewards are paid in the native token of the chosen DEX and the supply comes from the token’s outstanding supply. The operators of the DEX fix the APY for farming rewards, which LP tokens are eligible for farming rewards, and it also specifies the time frame for which the farming rewards will be available.</p>



<p>Some DEX have previously offered high APYs for farming, beyond 1000%. It is an attempt to attract a high amount of liquidity and attention to the DEX. These high rewards are unsustainable, as the rewards are paid in the native DEX token.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high APYs are very likely to attract so-called liquidity providers. These are participants who sacrifice their farming reward and immediately withdraw their liquidity the moment the farming rewards are evaporated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This reduces the liquidity of DEX and the DEX’s token without value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion: Calculation and Distribution of Rewards</strong></h3>



<p>These farm token rewards are allocated to individual users based on their proportion of LP tokens deposited in the farm and the time those LP tokens are kept in the farm.</p>



<p>The APY is estimated using a model that depends on distribution periods. This estimation generally assumes that 100% of the liquidity providers for the given pool for which they have deposited their LP tokens are in the farm for the duration of the distribution period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The liquidity providers who have deposited their LP tokens in the farm receive a higher APY than estimated. If the liquidity is increased during the time tokens were deposited in the pool, then the APY will be temporarily lower than estimated.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FAQs</strong></h4>



<p>What is the lockup period when depositing tokens at the yield farms?</p>



<p>It does not have a lockup period.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion: Latest Updates on LayerSwap</strong></h2>



<p>LayerSwap has reclaimed its domain after a hijack that lasted a short while. The hijack was able to drain roughly $100,000 of user funds.</p>



<p>The event was observed on Wednesday, March 20, at 19:40 UTC. The application experienced domain compromise, redirecting unsuspecting users to a malicious phishing rate.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6e0.png" alt="🛠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Layerswap March 20 incident<br><br>On March 20th, around 7:40 PM UTC, the <a href="https://twitter.com/GoDaddy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GoDaddy</a> account for our <a href="https://t.co/xGoN2q5vOa">https://t.co/xGoN2q5vOa</a> domain was compromised, and we&#39;re currently awaiting a comprehensive report from GoDaddy to understand the breach&#39;s specifics. Meanwhile, here&#39;s some context…</p>&mdash; Layerswap (@layerswap) <a href="https://twitter.com/layerswap/status/1770679223876780091?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><em><strong>London Stock Exchange has announced acceptance of applications for the approval of ETNs in the regulated market.</strong></em></p>



<p>Exchange Traded-Notes (ETNs) are types of unsecured debt securities that track an underlying index of securities and trade like stocks on major crypto exchanges. ETNs are like bonds without interest payments and their prices fluctuate like stocks.</p>



<p>These ETN values will rise and fall in line with the underlying crypto assets, subject to the deduction of fees and expenses. It gives investors exposure to the changing value of underlying crypto assets without critically holding the crypto assets themselves.</p>



<p>It appeals to investors who do not wish to invest directly in crypto assets, manage wallets or transact on unregulated crypto exchanges.</p>



<p>The crypto exchange-traded notes have gained popularity in recent years, with a steadily increasing range of features and underlying crypto assets being introduced in the market.</p>



<p>The performance and movements of most crypto assets are volatile; however, the stance on ETNs changed with the approval of the spot BTC ETF in the USA.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applications for Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded notes</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/10/02/london-stock-exchanges-blockchain-revolution-in-traditional-asset-trading/">London Stock Exchange</a> (LSE) announced that it will start accepting applications for Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in the second quarter of 2024. </p>



<p>The crypto ETN Admission Factsheet outlines the requirements for these products, and LSE has released the details. The processed ETNs for review need to be backed by Bitcoin or Ether. These products further need to be unleveraged and should have a publicly available market price or value measure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the London Stock Exchange has not announced the exact date for accepting applications. No major financial institutions have confirmed whether they will be applying for ETNs or not. They might respond once LSE opens the acceptance of applications.</p>



<p>As per the submitted factsheet, the underlying crypto assets must be “principally or wholly” stored in cold wallets or similar storage by custodians following Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, or the United States.</p>



<p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stated it will not contradict Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) building market segments for crypto-backed exchange-traded notes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The regulator signified that these products are aimed at professional investors, such as credit institutions and investment firms authorized or regulated to function in financial markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ETFs for Bitcoin have already been introduced and Ethereum ETFs are under approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Amid all these developments of products, Bitcoin and Ether ETNs are a new category and may open up new opportunities for investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Comparing ETNs and ETFs</strong></h2>



<p>Exchange-traded notes, abbreviated as ETNs, are unsecured debt securities that track their values from an underlying index and trade on major exchanges like stocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial institutions issue ETNs with a maturity date, and the repayment of the principal depends on the issuer’s financial viability. However, ETN does not make periodical interest payments but rather provides returns based on the performance of the underlying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>US-based financial services firm, Fidelity Investments, has shared advice with the investments for comparing ETFs or ETNs, stating,</p>



<p><em>“The decision of whether to opt for an ETF or ETN in the same product area depends largely on your investment time frame. Given that ETFs are subject to yearly capital gain and income distributions which are taxable events to the holder—and ETNs are not—it seems reasonable to conclude that ETNs are a superior product for the long-term investor.”</em></p>



<p>Fidelity Investments has said that ETNs may be considered an ironic investment because of the way they offer tax advantages. However, they also witness a significant risk as they provide access to more niche product areas, which are not recommended as staples for long-term investors.</p>



<p>ETFs and ETNs both track underlying benchmarks and trade on exchanges. They have multiple differences. ETFs are similar to mutual funds in that they facilitate asset holdings, including stocks or commodities. These assets derive the prices of ETFs.</p>



<p>Investment in the ETF allows ownership of a diversified asset block. Whereas ETNs are debt securities that guarantee to pay the index’s value at maturity, excluding fees. It exposes investors to the risks related to issuers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advantages of ETFs over ETNs</strong></h2>



<p>ETFs offer several advantages over ETNs, such as greater tax efficiency, as taxes are only charged upon sale. ETFs provide instant diversification by dividing the total investments into a basket of assets, reducing unsystematic risk for investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their expense ratio is also lower in comparison to actively managed mutual funds, making them cost-effective. Dividends in ETFs are also reinvested immediately and they offer liquidity and flexibility for trading. Further, ETFs have lower tracking errors than ETNs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advantages of ETNs over ETFs</strong></h2>



<p>In contrast, ETNs are preferred for investors who want exposure to specific indices or assets not available through investments in ETFs.</p>



<p>ETNs are highly tax-efficient for specific strategies, including short-term trading, as taxes are incurred only upon sale. However, ETNs expose investments to credit risk tied to the issuer’s financial stability, which an investor should consider.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion: Development of Crypto ETN</strong></h3>



<p>The introduction of crypto ETNs on the London Stock Exchange will have both positive and negative implications for the crypto landscape. It depends on one’s perspective on decentralization and regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The development of crypto ETNs and their adoption by major financial institutions mark steps towards the mainstream adoption and legitimization of cryptocurrencies. It will attract more institutional investors to the crypto market. This mode will also be a safer and more accessible entrance for investors who are hesitant to invest directly in cryptographic assets.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FAQs</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is increasing adoption in the crypto space?</p>



<p>The involvement of traditional financial institutions in the crypto markets is attracting more investors to the space.</p>



<p><strong>Q.</strong> Will ETNs increase regulation on the crypto market?</p>



<p>These will bring crypto assets under the regulatory framework.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/12/19/xdc-network-will-the-xdc-price-show-range-expansion-in-jan-2024/">XDC price</a> forecast suggests that XDC crypto has the potential to smash the upper levels and break the upper trendline of the channel. Currently, XDC cryptocurrency is waiting for a solid upward momentum to move towards the bullish phase on the daily chart.</p>



<p>To initiate this recovery and break out of the current consolidation phase on the daily chart, XDC crypto needs to attract more buyers.</p>



<p><strong>XDC Crypto Price vs Volume Analysis</strong></p>



<iframe loading="lazy" title="Santiment Chart: Price (XDC), Volume (XDC)" width="1170" height="425" src="https://embed.santiment.net/chart?ps=xdc-network&#038;pt=XDC&#038;df=2023-12-01T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&#038;dt=2024-03-22T18%3A29%3A59.514Z&#038;sat=shchcfg_Dbi0BMeEwkga&#038;emcg=1&#038;emhwm=1&#038;wm=price_usd%3Bvolume_usd&#038;wax=0%3B1&#038;wc=%2326C953%3B%23677bcf&#038;ws=%7B%22node%22%3A%22area%22%7D%3B" scrolling="no"></iframe>



<p>The volume and price graph displayed that the trading volume has increased from $8.05 Million to $24.96 Million in the last few days and the price has also increased. In the last few days, the price has increased from $0.043 to $0.046. The price is expected to bounce back in the short term.</p>



<p><strong>XDC Crypto Social Dominance vs Social Volume</strong></p>



<iframe loading="lazy" title="Santiment Chart: Price (XDC), Social Dominance (XDC), Social Volume (XDC)" width="1170" height="425" src="https://embed.santiment.net/chart?ps=xdc-network&#038;pt=XDC&#038;df=2023-12-21T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&#038;dt=2024-03-23T18%3A29%3A59.326Z&#038;sat=shchcfg_Dbi0BMeEwkga&#038;emcg=1&#038;emhwm=1&#038;wm=price_usd%3Bsocial_dominance_total%3Bsocial_volume_total&#038;wax=0%3B1%3B2&#038;wc=%233e9255%3B%23FF5B5B%3B%2368DBF4&#038;ws=%3B%7B%22interval%22%3A%221d%22%7D%3B%7B%22interval%22%3A%221d%22%7D" scrolling="no"></iframe>



<p>Based on the social dominance and social volume graph, the social dominance and social volume have been increasing for the last few months which has left a positive impact on the price.

To further enhance its deflationary nature, the DEXTools team commits to burning 10% of the tokens received from subscription payments each month. Currently, the circulating supply stands at 100 million DEXT tokens.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/10/12/apecoin-crypto-price-forecast-will-ape-surpass-the-2-350-level/">APE crypto price</a> has been performing in a downtrend since March 14. The price formed multiple lower-low swings and is still moving with bearish momentum to date, reflecting instability.</p>



<p>The APE price faces intense selling pressure from the $2.6 resistance level. The price fell 35% to the $0.943 decisional point of interest and is currently retaliating. APE price can surge above the $2.017 resistance if it strikes above the $0.1277 short-term high.</p>

<p>According to the santiment graph of price and volume has dropped from $267 Million to $72.87 Million since mid-March, and the price has also dropped with trading volume. Trading volume has dropped by more than 50% in a week and the price has also declined. If the trading volume keeps falling, then it may leave a negative impact on the price.</p>

<p>The social dominance and social volume graphs have been neutral for the last few months which means the awareness and information on social media like X, Instagram, and Telegram have stagnated. Suppose the social dominance and social volume graphs show improvement, then it may affect the APE price positively.</p>



<p>The trading volume&#8217;s sharp decline mirrors the price drop, hinting at reduced market interest and potential ongoing bearish sentiment. Social metrics also show a lack of growth in dominance and volume, which could imply limited community engagement and impact on the token&#8217;s value.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>The analysis indicates that ApeCoin (APE) is currently experiencing a bearish trend, with its price falling below crucial moving averages and a notable 6.62% decrease over the past week. The APE token, central to the APE Ecosystem&#8217;s governance and utility, is facing downward pressure, particularly after failing to overcome the resistance level at $2.6. The price has significantly dropped to a critical decision point of $0.943, suggesting a potential pivot or further decline based on upcoming market dynamics.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technical Levels&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Support Level: $1.776</p>



<p>Resistance Level: $2.017</p>
