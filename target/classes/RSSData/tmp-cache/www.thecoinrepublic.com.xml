<p><em><strong>Crypto(dot)com has been fined by the DNB, the central bank of the Netherlands for bypassing registration requirements for an extended period.</strong></em></p>



<p>According to Coindesk, the penalty was enforced for various reasons, one of which was serving a &#8220;considerable amount&#8221; of clients in the Netherlands, in addition to failing to pay supervisory expenses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Failure From Crypto(dot)com</strong></h2>



<p>The company had reportedly failed to register for over two years while providing <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/13/hex-crypto-crashes-29-intraday-is-the-downfall-over-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto</a> services, and a fine of $3 Million was imposed in October. However, the news of the fine was not disclosed until recently.</p>



<p>Crypto(dot)com, or Foris DAX MT, opted to ignore compliance requirements and continue to operate without registering until at least November 8, 2022. In addition to this DNB revealed that the standard fine for such activities starts at&nbsp; $2.5 Million. However, given the audacity and gravity of the situation, the penalty was increased.</p>



<p>Reportedly, Crypto(dot)com&#8217;s failure to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit-Netherlands was a significant shortcoming in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto(dot)com eventually secured its registration in the Netherlands by July 2023. However, DNB previously stated that Dutch customers could use the exchange without any issues, even though it was operating illegally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto(dot)com&#8217;s Similarity With Binance&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Crypto(dot)com&#8217;s situation is interesting to compare to Binance&#8217;s, which faced a larger fine of €3.6 Million ($4.2 Million) for similar registration evasion. This is causing it to withdraw from the Dutch market following an unsuccessful registration attempt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to this, Crypto(dot)com shrugged off the fine and declared that it was a &#8220;past and rectified incident,&#8221; assuring customers that it was business as usual.</p>



<p>Crypto(dot)com&#8217;s unregistered status gave it a competitive edge by avoiding supervisory fees and compliance costs. However, it was unable to report unusual transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit-Netherlands. This took place during the period of non-compliance, which was taken into account when the fine was imposed.</p>



<p>Crypto(dot)com filed an objection to the DNB&#8217;s decision on October 9, and it was granted registration in the Netherlands in July 2023. According to a DNB spokesperson, Dutch customers had been permitted to use the exchange legally, even though it was operating illegally.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Kraken Received VASP registration</strong></h3>



<p>Kraken, another large crypto exchange, recently acquired its fourth European license and proudly displayed its Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registration from DNB. The VASP license is one of the most critical components of a set of regulations known as MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets). These are intended to keep digital asset businesses under tight control within the European Union.</p>



<p>Kraken&#8217;s expansion into the Dutch market, armed with the necessary regulatory approvals, could be a game-changer. Currently, around 20% of Dutch citizens are said to own cryptocurrency.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>Crypto(dot)com operated without registering until Nov 8, 2022, ignoring compliance requirements. DNB revealed the penalty for such activities starts at $2.5M. Kraken, another crypto exchange, acquired its fourth European license and proudly displayed its VASP registration from DNB.</p>

<p>The Shiba Inu crypto is hovering back and forth in recent sessions amid volatility. The crypto is trying to stabilize near the highs after a massive rise in the last couple of weeks.</p>



<p>Moreover, the 4-hour chart shows the formation of a descending triangle pattern. On the higher side, the price has taken multiple rejections from a trendline resistance and declined. On the lower side, a horizontal level of $0.0000299 has been acting as a demand and preventing the price from falling lower.</p>



<p>The breakout of the trendline resistance may validate the completion of a short term correction and the SHIB price may shoot to the new higher supply level. However, if the sellers to defend the highs and the crypto breaks below the recent demand zone. It may drop near the 20-Day exponential moving average at $0.000026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier, Shiba Inu crypto had spiked nearly 250% higher in the 1st week of March after the jump in burn rate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shiba Inu Crypto Volume Analysis</strong></h2>

<p>Moreover, the SHIB crypto noted a significant and continuous rise in the volume inflow by the first week of March along with the price rise. Afterwards, the volume fell this week and price started consolidating, it seems like the price is sustaining at top and getting ready for an upsurge in coming sessions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The live market capitalization of Shiba Inu crypto is $19.32 Billion and ranks 11th in the overall crypto market. The intraday trading volume is $2.32 Billion which has surged nearly 49% as compared to the previous day. The current circulating supply is 589.28 Trillion SHIB tokens.&nbsp;</p>

This scenario could invite more buying opportunities for whales in the coming sessions.</p>



<p>Moreover, the higher market capitalization provides better liquidity as it assists in better investing and buying or selling of SHIB assets more quickly and easily. The market capitalization is declining as a result of a minor profit booking, since the fall is not big, major buying can push the market cap upside along with the price</p>

<p>From a technical perspective, the Relative strength index (RSI) indicator was placed at 72.31 points and that of the SMA line was placed at 84.29 points. Both the RSI and SMA line were hovering in an overbought region indicating a possible correction or consolidation in the crypto.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The long-term trend outlook is bullish which may continue to add buying volume inflow at the lower levels. The crypto lifted off nearly 245% last month.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>Shiba Inu Crypto has been consolidating near the recent highs in the recent sessions. The price is up nearly 245% in the last one month indicating a massive jump in the price.

<p>The Polkadot crypto OI data exhibits the total number of open contracts which saw a persistent surge in the number of OI contracts in the recent sessions. During the past session, open contracts advanced enormously from 140 Million to 260 Million. However, there has been a short-term OI decline up to 230 Million and its most recent sessions currently stand at 256.72 Million. This highlights the DOT asset&#8217;s potential for a greater rise in future sessions.</p>



<p>In the same way, the chart demonstrates the activity of whales in the Polkadot crypto alongside the price movement in the same period. Whales have been consistently increasing their portfolio with DOT since January&#8217;s end. The Polkadot price has been showing more whale buying, and the price is showing its correspondence on the chart as well.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" title="Santiment Chart: Percent of Stablecoin Total Supply held by Whales with more than 5 million USD, Total Open Interest in USD (DOT)" width="1170" height="425" src="https://embed.santiment.net/chart?ps=polkadot-new&#038;pt=DOT&#038;df=2023-11-15T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&#038;dt=2024-03-14T18%3A29%3A59.590Z&#038;emcg=1&#038;emhwm=1&#038;wm=percent_of_whale_stablecoin_total_supply%3Btotal_open_interest&#038;wax=0%3B1&#038;wc=%23FF5B5B%3B%23FFCB47&#038;ws=%3B" scrolling="no"></iframe>



<p>The DOT chart shows the relationship between the Polkadot crypto&#8217;s volume and market cap. Looking at the chart, it is observed that both asset volume and market cap were low in January last week. That meant a lack of interest and activity in the market for the Polkadot asset at that duration. Volume was mostly under $3.5 Billion and market cap was around $40 Billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in the first week of February, volume and market cap continued to rise, indicating increased demand and excitement about DOT crypto price. The trading volume exceeded $4.5 Billion and the market cap rose drastically from $35 Billion to $76 Billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the higher market capitalization provides better liquidity as it assists in better investing and buying or selling of DOT assets more quickly and easily</p>



<p>The movement in trading volume mirrors the market cap, making it comfortable to buy or sell without affecting the Polkadot price. Additionally, the social volume has been on the rise in recent sessions with the rise in Polkadot price. The rise in the social volume also indicates the rising awareness of DOT crypto among users and a continuation of the ongoing short-term trend.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOT Crypto Price Evaluation Over Daily Time Frame</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/02/21/polkadot-crypto-price-prediction-will-dot-crypto-break-dynamic-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOT crypto</a> has experienced a price surge of 1.62% in the last 24 hours, and on the daily chart currently trading at $11.56. The Polkadot crypto is bullish on the daily chart and appears ready to smash the resistance level and soar to new heights from the current support zone.</p>



<p>Therefore, if the demand for the DOT remains high, the asset price could bounce back from the current level. The next goal for the Polkadot price is to reach $14.00.</p>



<p>The Polkadot crypto asset is displaying bullish characteristics and can extend its gains. It has shown good performance in the past week, and one month by 12.17%, and 61.03% respectively, indicating a consistent upward trend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DOT crypto asset is exhibiting bullish strength and rising capacity as it holds above major EMAs. However, if the Polkadot crypto price fails to stay above the $9.500 level, it could decline further.</p>

<p><em><strong>Thailand&#8217;s cabinet has approved a tax exemption for cryptocurrency earnings to promote investment token fundraising, several local news outlets confirmed.</strong></em></p>



<p>Thailand&#8217;s improving regulatory stance toward crypto has already caught the attention of some big players in the industry. On March 13, the Thai cabinet approved a measure that exempts individuals from certain types of taxes on investment tokens</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thai Cabinet’s Tax Exemptions</strong></h2>



<p>The new measure will focus on earnings from investment tokens, exempting these profits from personal income tax calculations. The Thai cabinet has two different types of crypto tax exemptions, capital gains tax and value added tax.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Capital Gains Exemptions</strong></h3>



<p>By removing the 15% capital gains tax on investment tokens, holders do not need to include their profits when calculating their income tax, thus eliminating double taxation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if someone has sold their investment and received profit on the sale, they first had to give 15% tax on the profits as well as income tax on the total income plus the previous profit this used to cause double taxation. After this move, the individual will not have to pay the tax on the profit twice.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Value Added Tax Exemptions</strong></h3>



<p>This move by the government also eliminates the value added tax or VAT on crypto transactions, making digital assets more accessible to a wider audience. Thailand is aiming to attract crypto investment and stimulate economic growth, particularly after a challenging year due to a slowdown in goods exports and the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its tourism industry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Benefits of These Exemptions</strong></h2>



<p>The Thai Securities and <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/01/30/philippines-security-and-exchange-commission-seeking-to-regulate-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) said that Thailand expects about 18.5 Billion baht (about $519 Million) in token investments over the next nine months.</p>



<p>Sergio S, CEO and co-founder of crypto market-making service provider Coinrate commented that Thailand is taking a decisive step. This step is toward asserting itself as a global center for digital assets. It is done by extending the exemption from VAT on cryptocurrency trading, which enhances the country&#8217;s attractiveness to crypto investors and traders, reducing financial barriers and stimulating market activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, last month, the SEC eased some restrictions on investing in digital tokens. These included lifting investment limits on digital tokens backed by real estate or generating real estate income streams, as well as those with infrastructure operations or revenue streams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the regulator also reviewed the criteria for establishing custodial wallet provider businesses, enabling them to offer services to digital asset business operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance recently unveiled its joint venture crypto exchange Binance Thailand, which provides a platform for digital asset exchange services with Thai baht trading pairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to this, Kulaya Tantitemit, director-general of Thailand&#8217;s Revenue Department, reportedly said that the Ministry of Finance through the Revenue Department recognizes the importance of digital tokens for investment (Investment Token), which will be another tool for raising funds for business operators in the country.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>Thailand government’s measures combined with the latest cabinet nod will help push the country to the forefront as a global hub for investment fundraising, authorities said. The move of removing VAT as well as capital gains tax is predicted to increase investments by about half a Billion dollars.</p>

<p>The Chainlink crypto is extending its move on the lower side after pausing on Wednesday. At the time of writing, the LINK price had slumped nearly 1.39% and was hovering near $20.46.</p>



<p>The daily chart displays the formation of a rising wedge pattern near the recent highs. Recently, The price suffered rejection from the higher boundary of the wedge formed and made its way towards the lower boundary of the wedge pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the lower side, the 20 and 50-Day EMAs have been acting as dynamic support as the price has taken a rebound multiple times for the EMAs. Currently, the LINK cryptocurrency price hovers near the yearly high value and round number of $20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the upward momentum seems to be cooling down as the price seems to be struggling near the highs. It suggests a lack of buyers at the highs which may invite the sellers to execute short positions and price may slump for a correction.</p>
