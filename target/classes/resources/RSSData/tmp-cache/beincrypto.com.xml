<p><strong>Unlike the rest of the market, Fetch.ai&#8217;s (FET) price prevented major losses over the last 24 hours as the altcoin kept its decline limited to 2%.</strong></p>



<p>The credit for this goes to the whales who offset the bearish cues. Nevertheless, there is still a threat to the altcoin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fetch-ai-saved-whales-for-the-win">Fetch.ai Saved &#8211; Whales for the Win</h2>



<p>The crypto market correction is weighing heavily on all the digital assets, but <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fet-investors-are-preventing-price-from-lows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fetch.ai&#8217;s price somehow did not fall as much</a>. FET only noted a 2% correction throughout the day. However, that does not cover up for the fact that the altcoin could have dropped by over 15%. All thanks to the whales for not letting this happen.</p>



<p>The intra-day lows of $2.37 were nearly locked in as trading price before the whales stepped in. The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fet-price-all-time-high-whales-selling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large wallet holders accumulated FET heavily, resulting in the price bouncing</a> back. </p>



<p>Addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million FET managed to amass over 18 million FET in two days. This is worth over $50 million, bringing their holdings to 327.81 million FET.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="850" height="288" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fetch-FET-20.32.38-15-Mar-2024-850x288.png" alt="Fetch.AI Whale Accumulation.

<p>Consequently, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fet-reaches-new-yearly-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fetch.ai price can be seen trading</a> at $2.80 at the time of writing.</p>

  </section>



<p>Beyond the whales, the altcoin also has solid support at the $2.26 price point. This level is the upper limit of the range in which about 394 million FET tokens worth over $1.1 billion were purchased by investors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="850" height="269" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-194458-850x269.png" alt="Fetch.AI GIOM.

<p>Thus, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fet-price-retest-next-bearish-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fetch.ai&#8217;s price will bounce back from this level</a> should it come across it, as investors will likely keep from booking profits out of fear of losses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fet-price-prediction-bearish-momentum-is-yet-to-build">FET Price Prediction: Bearish Momentum Is yet to Build</h2>



<p>Fetch.ai&#8217;s price nearly slipped to $2.37 but bounced back to the trading price of $2.80. This establishes the precedent that the bullish steam has not been completely exhausted. The altcoin is still above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, which is also a positive signal, making <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fetch-ai-attracts-whale-demand-price-bounce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FET safe from falling below</a> the $2.46 support floor.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Parabolic SAR, a trend-following indicator that helps traders identify potential reversals in price direction, indicates a downtrend. While the black dots are present above the candlestick, it is not intensive yet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="850" height="391" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FrUp7slr-850x391.png" alt="FET/USDT 1-day chart.

<p>Additionally, the Average Directional Index (ADX) is also above the 25.0 threshold. ADX is used to assess the strength of the momentum, and the downtrend is losing strength presently as the indicator is noting a downtick.</p>

<p>But, this does not rule out the potential of this trend gaining strength down the line, which could pull Fetch.aiI price down to $2.46. Losing this support line would invalidate the bullish thesis, sending FET to $2.26 or beyond.</p>

<p><strong>FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faces a potential 50-year prison sentence. </strong></p>



<p>Convicted in November for orchestrating what prosecutors have termed one of the &#8220;biggest financial frauds in American history,&#8221; Bankman-Fried&#8217;s downfall is a tale of ambition gone awry, set against the backdrop of the cryptocurrency boom.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sam-bankman-fried-faces-up-to-50-years-in-prison">Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Up to 50 Years in Prison</h2>



<p>The crux of the prosecution&#8217;s argument hinges on Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s fraudulent activities, which led to the spectacular collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The jury in a Manhattan federal court found him guilty on all charges, including defrauding investors, customers, and lenders. Thereby, unsettling the once booming crypto market.</p>



<p>Prosecutors have painted a damning portrait of Bankman-Fried, describing his recent life as marred by &#8220;unmatched greed and hubris.&#8221; They argue that his actions were risky and a deliberate ploy to gamble with billions of dollars of other people. </p>



<p>Despite the gravity of his actions, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/sam-bankman-fried-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> has refrained from admitting wrongdoing. This is a stance that has only compounded the case against him.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Even now, Bankman-Fried refuses to admit what he did was wrong. His life in recent years has been one of unmatched greed and hubris; of ambition and rationalization; and courting risk and gambling repeatedly with other people&#8217;s money,&#8221; prosecutors wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In contrast, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sam-bankman-fried-dodge-century-prison-sentence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense argues for leniency</a>, suggesting a prison term of just over five to six years. They contend that most <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ftx-to-sell-anthropic-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX clients will recover their lost funds</a> and that Bankman-Fried did not intentionally set out to commit fraud. </p>



<p>This defense, however, seems to falter against the weight of evidence presented during the trial. These include testimony from several of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s closest associates who have since turned state&#8217;s witnesses.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The impending sentencing on March 28 will conclude this chapter of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s life and set a precedent for regulating and overseeing the cryptocurrency industry. US Attorney Damian Williams emphasized the age-old nature of corruption revealed by this case, reflecting that while the players and platform might be new, the deceit practiced is a tale as old as time.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Sam Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. The cryptocurrency industry might be new. The players, like Sam Bankman-Fried, might be new. But this kind of corruption is as old as time,&#8221; attorney Williams said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Crafting a compelling pitch for a crypto project is essential in capturing the attention of venture capitalists (VCs), who sift through hundreds of proposals weekly. </strong></p>



<p>Still, invaluable insights can be learned into what VCs look for in crypto startups. These include outlining a blueprint for entrepreneurs to refine their approach, focusing on timing, clarity, market understanding, team composition, and community engagement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-the-perfect-pitch">Building the Perfect Pitch</h2>



<p>Danilo Carlucci, Founder and CEO of Morningstar Ventures, told BeInCrypto that timing is critical. Startups should engage VCs only when they have a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates their product&#8217;s or service&#8217;s feasibility and potential. This stage is crucial for eliciting initial interest and feedback from investors. </p>



<p>Then, utilizing this feedback to refine the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) allows startups to showcase tangible achievements and metrics, making a stronger case for investment. According to Carlucci, proper timing and iteration of these stages, evidenced by quantifiable success metrics, significantly impact the project&#8217;s Future Diluted Valuation (FDV).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Timing is such a difficult thing to get perfect. But if start-ups time their project stages correctly and iterate them, they can raise more funds, ultimately impacting their FDV,&#8221; Carlucci said. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also emphasized the importance of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/web3-interview-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarity and conciseness in pitches</a>. A successful pitch concisely articulates the problem being solved, the uniqueness of the solution, and the strategic use of capital. More importantly, clear go-to-market strategies and user acquisition plans are particularly compelling. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="289" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-8.16.39-PM-850x289.png" alt="Most Recent Fundraises by Company" class="wp-image-484854" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-8.16.39-PM-850x289.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-8.16.39-PM-360x123.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-8.16.39-PM-768x261.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-8.16.39-PM-1536x523.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-8.16.39-PM-2048x697.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-8.16.39-PM-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Most Recent Fundraises by Company.

<p>Projects that distinguish themselves through a well-defined unique selling proposition (USP), backed by thorough market and competitor analysis, stand out. Incorporating on-chain metrics and market trends can further enhance a project&#8217;s attractiveness by providing a clear picture of its potential.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Weâve all heard it before. Less is more. As simple as it sounds, we value clear and concise pitches. Keep it short and sweet! Not only do VCs read through hundreds of pitches a week, but I firmly believe that the less time it takes to explain your project, the better it will be,&#8221; Carlucci advice. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Likewise, Samuel Huber, the CEO of Landvault and the Matera Protocol, told BeInCrypto that startups should pivot their focus toward hard metrics. These include profitability, burn rate, and capital efficiency, which are now paramount to investors. Even with the current enthusiasm in the crypto market, the broader economy will likely continue to adopt a cautious approach.</p>



<p>The emphasis on real revenue generation cannot be overstated. In the flux of market cycles, where <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/must-have-crypto-portfolio-bull-run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bull markets</a> often prioritize growth at the expense of solid business foundations, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-ways-to-make-money-in-a-crypto-bear-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bear markets</a> shift the focus back to fundamental metrics like revenue.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Entrepreneurs should shift their focus towards metrics that investors prioritize. Indeed, crypto startups need to demonstrate their ability to generate real revenue. They must focus on showcasing practical business models rather than solely emphasizing decentralization,&#8221; Huber explained. </p>

<p>The path to funding is fraught with challenges. &#8220;There&#8217;s a tightening of funds for startups with unproven business models and poor execution,&#8221; Huber noted. He emphasized the importance of demonstrating tangible business metrics over mere projections. This calls for a meticulous focus on building a solid business that stands out in a bear market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tokenomics-and-the-dream-team">Tokenomics and the Dream Team</h2>



<p>Moreover, the team behind a project is a critical factor for VCs. Carlucci emphasized that VCs invest in people as much as in ideas. Therefore, a team&#8217;s track record, complementarity, and vision are scrutinized. The team&#8217;s openness to collaboration and feedback and a proactive approach significantly influence a VC&#8217;s investment decision. </p>



<p>In this regard, most VCs look for teams with a strong track record and extensive experience in their field.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The team is everything! No matter the tech, the design, or the idea, most VCs invest in people; therefore, the team and the vision of the founder is crucial,&#8221; Carlucci said. </p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/tokenomics-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokenomics</a> and crypto narrative trends play a crucial role in attracting investment. Projects must design tokenomics that align VCs&#8217; interests with the project&#8217;s long-term vision, ensuring a vested interest in the project&#8217;s success. Likewise, entrepreneurs must align their projects with prevailing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-narratives-altcoins-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto narratives</a>, striving to position themselves as leaders within these spaces. </p>



<p>Despite the inherent risks in the crypto industry, Carlucci suggested that a well-articulated USP and comprehensive market analysis can address potential concerns and demonstrate the startup&#8217;s awareness of and preparedness for challenges. Meanwhile, Huber highlighted the importance of utility and adaptability. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Generally, projects within infrastructure sectors are highly attractive to investors due to their potential for broader utility. While applications certainly create value, infrastructure projects influenced by narrative trends such as NFTs, the metaverse, DeFi, RWA, or the creator economy offer a foundation that can be leveraged by others, thereby enhancing their resilience,&#8221; Huber added.</p>

<p>Trust is also a critical factor in investment decisions. VCs prefer to back founders they know and trust, reflecting the importance of building a strong company and networking to enhance credibility. In Huber&#8217;s view, the journey to securing VC funding in the crypto market is as much about showcasing resilience and innovation as it is about navigating the nuances of investor expectations and market dynamics.</p>



<p>Indeed, Carlucci highlighted the importance of selecting the right VC partners. Startups should seek strategic partners offering more than capital, such as user access, networking opportunities, and industry expertise. </p>

<p>By focusing on timing, clarity, team dynamics, tokenomics, and strategic partnerships, startups can increase their chances of attracting the necessary funding to propel their projects forward. Adhering to these principles is instrumental to securing venture capital funding in the crypto market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The Book of Meme (BOME) token, created by the artist behind Pepe, Darkfarms, has surged 20 times in three hours. This remarkable increase has propelled the crypto asset&#8217;s market value to nearly $400 million.</strong></p>



<p>The pre-sale for the BOOK OF MEME altcoin began on March 13, allowing participants to send an unspecified amount of Solana (SOL) to a designated address.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solana-meme-coin-skyrockets">Solana Meme Coin Skyrockets</h2>



<p>BOME quickly gained traction within the Sino-British community. The pre-sale garnered an unexpected 10,131 SOL, far surpassing Darkfarms&#8217;s 500 to 600 SOL expectations. The overwhelming response led to a subsequent community vote on allocating pre-sale funds.</p>



<p>Following the pre-sale, Darkfarms integrated the raised funds into a liquidity pool, setting BOME&#8217;s initial price of $0.0000496. Large purchase orders of 100 SOL created a highly liquid market that led to a price peak of $0.0012. This surge later increased the token&#8217;s market capitalization to $375 million.</p>



<p>Following BOME&#8217;s rise, several exchanges, including BitMart and HTX, said they would list the asset. Bitmart later confirmed the primary listing of the altcoin with an initial USDT trading pair.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;BitMart is thrilled to announce the primary listingÂ ofÂ BOOK OF MEME (BOME)Â on March 14th, 2024&#8230;Deposit feature: Available&#8230; Trading Pair:Â BOME/USDT,&#8221; BitMart <a href="https://support.bitmart.com/hc/en-us/articles/23810086172827--Primary-Listing-BitMart-Will-List-BOOK-OF-MEME-BOME" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>Book of Meme comprises an updateable electronic magazine, a meme creation tool, and a comprehensive meme library with non-mint JPEGs. Built on Solana by the artist behind the Pepe meme coin, the project uses Arweave, IPFS, and inscriptions for data storage and doubles as a social platform for cross-chain storage. Its later plans include using a single NFT to link all stored content related to a particular meme. </p>



<p>BOME&#8217;s <a href="https://www.panewslab.com/zh/articledetails/9m6d8kl5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surge</a> coincides with a broader uptick in the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/memecoin-sector-crypto-market-cap-moves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coin sector</a> that reached a market cap of $40 billion recently. Earlier this year, Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), and Dogwifhat (WIF) were at the forefront, with the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/meme-coin-skyrocket-buy-sell-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WIF soaring 45%</a> and setting a new all-time high of $3.45.</p>

<p>However, the recent increase in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-defi-network-activity-increasing-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana network activity</a> has also attracted malicious actors. Security firm BlockAid reported crypto scams two months ago targeting Solana users through <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-wallet-drainers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wallet drainer attacks</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>the Ripple (XRP) price follows the path of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. This is not a good sign for the investors.</strong></p>



<p>Their situation is close to worsening, and should Ripple lose this crucial support; all the profits noted this month would be erased.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-holders-in-peril">Ripple Holders in Peril</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-xrp-price-correction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP price has been falling</a> for the past three days as the whole crypto market has been correcting. Due to the influence of Bitcoin, the altcoin is charting red candlesticks on the daily chart, falling through major support levels.</p>



<p>Already, nearly <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-400-million-xrp-transaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">80% of all gains from the month of March have been lost</a> owing to the decline, bringing the altcoin to trade at $0.625. This drawdown, in addition to the investors, has also affected leverage traders.</p>



<p>Long contracts pining for an increase in XRP price have been losing money as liquidations have dominated the market. In the past 24 hours, over $4.47 million worth of long liquidations have been recorded.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="850" height="242" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-850x242.png" alt="Ripple Liquidations" class="wp-image-484636" style="aspect-ratio:3.512396694214876;width:952px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-850x242.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-360x102.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-768x219.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-1536x437.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704-150x43.png 150w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-143704.png 1722w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ripple Liquidations.

<p>This will discourage traders from betting on price increases, which would circumvent any possibility of the altcoin attempting a revival again.</p>



<p>Furthermore, technical indicators are also signaling a bearish outcome at the moment. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already fallen below the neutral line of 50.0 into the bearish zone. RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in a security.</p>

<p>Secondly, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also on the verge of noting a bearish crossover. MACD, a momentum indicator, tracks the correlation between two moving averages of a security&#8217;s price, aiding in trend identification.</p>

<p>Combining the two makes it evident that the likely outcome for XRP will be bearish.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-price-prediction-more-losses-on-the-way">XRP Price Prediction: More Losses on the Way</h2>



<p>XRP price is trading at $0.612, dropping by 8.5% in the past 24 hours. As the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-brad-garlinghouse-xrp-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aforementioned instances make it clear</a> that the altcoin will likely see more decline, it could see a fall to $0.606 and beyond.</p>



<p>This would result in the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-price-long-term-support-level-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple token losing the crucial 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement</a> support level and wiping out more than 90% of March&#8217;s gains. As is, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has been lost as a support. If XRP falls through the 100-day EMA as well, erasing the entire profits noted in the last two weeks.</p>

<p>But while the market signals a decline, whales attempt to minimize these losses by accumulating XRP. In the last 48 hours, addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have added more than 50 million XRP worth over $30 million.</p>

<p><strong>Chainlinkâs (LINK) financial trajectory is turning heads, as its Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) revenue has soared by 180% in two months. </strong></p>



<p>This surge, driven by the escalating adoption of its multichain bridging platform, positions LINK for a potential climb to the $200 mark.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-chainlink-link-price-poised-for-10x-surge">Is Chainlink (LINK) Price Poised for 10X Surge?</h2>



<p>In a financial upturn, CCIPâs fee revenue leaped from approximately $61,728 in January to an impressive $174,000 in the first half of March. Dune Analytics reports that since its launch in July 2023, the protocolâs total revenue has hit $380,818. </p>



<p>Analyzing fee contributions, the Ethereum layer-2 protocol Arbitrum leads at 28%, closely followed by the Base at 24%. Consequently, Chainlinkâs strategic moves have paid off, enhancing its financial and operational footprint.</p>

<p>Community ambassador âChainLinkGodâ <a href="https://twitter.com/chainlinkgod/status/1767053780376584237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighted</a> that CCIP fees are designed to cover transaction gas costs and pay service providers. Furthermore, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chainlink-announces-new-integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlinkâs strategic integrations</a> have spiked adoption. </p>



<p>These include partnerships with the Metis layer-2 network, auditing entity Code4rena, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/circle-files-us-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stablecoin firm Circle</a>, and a significant alliance with <a href="https://beincrypto.com/south-korea-investigation-web3-game-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korean game developer Wemade</a>.</p>



<p>Moreover, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/smartcon-2022-chainlink-partner-with-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration with SWIFT</a> in 2022 for a token transfer project underscored Chainlinkâs expanding influence.

<p>However, the community outlook is even more bullish. Analyst Satoshi Flipper predicts a massive uptake of CCIP, which could catapult LINK to the $200 region. This represents a significant increase from current levels, underscoring CCIPâs revenue growth as a catalyst for Chainlinkâs potential price surge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>PancakeSwap has announced its much-anticipated version 4. This new iteration, PancakeSwap v4, marks a significant advancement, promising enhanced flexibility, functionality, and efficiency. </strong></p>



<p>It aims to rectify the limitations of version 3 and redefine the standards for decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-the-new-features-of-pancakeswap-v4">What Are the New Features of PancakeSwap V4?</h2>



<p>According to an announcement shared with BeInCrypto, PancakeSwap v4 is set for a third-quarter <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-dencun-upgrade-goes-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release on Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bnb-chain-facilitates-wsteth-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BNB Chain</a>. It aims to offer a transformative trading experience. </p>



<p>With <a href="https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-base-open-source-contracts-layer-2/">open-source licensing</a>, the DEX plans to foster collaboration and community contribution within the DeFi ecosystem, signaling a leap forward in blockchain technology.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;We aim to foster the most comprehensive flexibility and functionality within the Automated Market Maker (AMM) space, built together by the Kitchen (PancakeSwap team) and DeFi developers in the crypto community. Hence, the PancakeSwap v4 code will be released under an open-source license,&#8221; Chef Mochi, Head of PancakeSwap, said.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Notably, PancakeSwap v4 <a href="https://beincrypto.com/uniswap-v4-customization-community-contribution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduces hooks</a>. These are external contracts that augment liquidity pool functionalities. Hooks facilitate dynamic fee adjustments, the integration of custom oracles, and more, thereby granting developers unprecedented customization and control. </p>



<p><strong>Read more: <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-use-pancakeswap/">How To Use PancakeSwap: A Step-By-Step Guide</a></strong></p>



<p>Additionally, the platform supports various pool types, including Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLAMM) and Liquidity Book. Moreover, PancakeSwap v4 introduces Flash Accounting. This feature consolidates all pools into a single contract, slashing deployment costs by 99%. </p>



<p>It also reduces gas expenses for multi-hop swaps, enhancing the platformâs efficiency and user appeal.</p>



<p>In contrast, another <a href="https://beincrypto.com/decentralized-exchange-uniswap-defi-security/">DEX leader â Uniswap,</a> integrated similar features earlier this year. This move indicates a broader industry trend towards more flexible and efficient DeFi platforms. </p>



<p>However, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/copy-paste-pancakeswap-forks-uniswap-v3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PancakeSwap&#8217;s approach in version 3</a>, which involved forking Uniswap&#8217;s code, sparked controversy last year. It highlighted the industry&#8217;s struggle with innovation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;We keep up with the latest advancements in the AMM space, alongside a number of our own unique enhancements, to ensure users have access to the best DEX available,&#8221; Chef Mochi explained BeInCrypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Amid these strategic developments, the native token of PancakeSwap, CAKE, shows signs of an impending surge. Technical analysis points to a bullish cup and handle pattern on the weekly charts, suggesting a potential 300% increase to approximately $17. </p>

<p><strong>Cryptocurrency trading is often viewed with caution due to its volatility and the perceived lack of steady, secure returns. The promise of significant profits exists, but the challenges of fluctuating regulations and the potential for dramatic price changes categorize digital currencies as a high-risk investment.</strong></p>



<p>But what if you could mitigate the risk and safeguard your initial capital investment in all market conditions? This is where <a href="https://algosone.ai?utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a0&amp;utm_content=a58.040324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AlgosOne</a>, a new AI trading algorithm leveraging the latest developments in <a href="https://algosone.ai/ai-trading?utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a0&amp;utm_content=a58.040324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">generative AI</a>, comes in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This regulated AI trading tool not only aims to deliver substantial returns on investments but does so with a commitment to security, aiming to protect the initial capital investment under various market conditions. Remarkably, access to this <a href="https://algosone.ai/technology?utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a0&amp;utm_content=a58.040324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">advanced technology</a> is offered at no cost.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-automating-everything"><strong>Automating Everything</strong></h2>



<p>One of the main differentiators between AlgosOne and other institutional-calibre artificial intelligence based Bitcoin and Ethereum trading tools is that it is completely hands-off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thereâs no coding, strategy formulation, research, analysis, or risk management. AlgosOne picks the asset, position size, trade direction, and entry and exit times. It also automatically implements risk mitigation with stop losses, take profits, hedging, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/LcsSZxgQgtzDV4dfEMP6fzJeP8byOKPIJTkx9GpWD159HP_48ExuVKjbJ40EhgELCZbaVyoC0ixrqfPBTt0Lx6LjZ_4tHQtJ4BmMcNRoaJNGAfUziREF0ZO4jWDtr-vXw1_pQtx77KU_cBt_7qJwcQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>You just sign up, deposit, then sit back and earn a passive profit.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reducing-exposure"><strong>Reducing Exposure</strong></h2>



<p>When Bitcoin, Smart Unidirectional Investment (SUI), or Ethereum trading, you want to safeguard your capital as best as you can.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the primary ways in which AlgosOne achieves this is by combining the strengths of game-changing machine-learning technology and human experience and expertise. This ensures you are not handing over full control of your crypto to a machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Professional risk management teams are tracking the market and trading system performance around the clock to shield against instances of flawed data or bias skewing the algorithmâs decision-making and cases of extreme market upheaval that might require human intervention.</p>



<p>AlgosOne also protects your capital by adhering to regulatory requirements. Fully licensed and authorised, AlgosOne segregates client and company funds, implements KYC and AML identity verification procedures, and protects against hacks with strict technological security protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In compliance with the toughest regulations, it also maintains a reserve fund with a sufficient balance to cover all client account capital in case of a breach, a technical failure, company or market collapse.&nbsp; Adherence to regulation also means accounts are never overleveraged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AlgosOneâs deep-learning capabilities mean that it learns as it goes, improving its ability to optimise risk-adjusted returns with every additional trade, user, and dataset. The algorithm uses a range of different statistically validated techniques and AI-driven investment strategies to automatically mitigate exposure on every trade, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Offsetting risk with hedging strategies</li>



<li>Diversifying portfolios with a range of <a href="https://algosone.ai/markets?utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a0&amp;utm_content=a58.040324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asset classes</a></li>



<li>Automating stops and limits&nbsp;</li>



<li>Avoiding overexposure with caps on trade size</li>



<li>Providing compensation for losing trades</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-generating-profits"><strong>Generating Profits</strong></h2>



<p>Letâs face it, the main factor determining your satisfaction with any AI trading tool is its capacity to generate profits, and this is precisely where AlgosOne excels.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xpn2SqsYCITKMQ7eTlrOUh9JcuSYC19qnAqTl9al8qFMUWRp4PLJpwaCEYiabqpwfB1gIDigJAqQ6_zeZzmfEX3Y6Q5UlPLU71j9FAxqbV7bmpUlP6dbf4Jkq8_iJcZY-uoWDGtOsRtEFN-Y-C3DTg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Obviously, there is no such thing as an investment guarantee or a Bitcoin trading solution that gets it right on every single trade, but over the long run, AlgosOne has proven its ability to hit its targets and offset any short-term losses throughout its trading contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For each <a href="https://algosone.ai/trading?utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a0&amp;utm_content=a58.040324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trading tier</a>, which is based on deposit size, AlgosOne publishes an anticipated profit percentage bracket, which it has consistently been able to meet or exceed, and the profits are far and away the highest offered by any competitor in the space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, the company has just completed a major upgrade, which has involved expanding and diversifying the algorithmâs datasets, as well as improving its ability to detect high-probability opportunities and evaluate risk potential with greater precision while increasing its access to top-quality live data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eliminating-costs"><strong>Eliminating Costs</strong></h2>



<p>AlgosOne is also guaranteeing that your initial Bitcoin trading investment is protected by means of its fee structure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AlgosOne traders do not pay any subscription, account maintenance, deposit, or transaction fees. With no spreads eating into your principal, all your balance goes towards generating a profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is only one fee, a <a href="https://algosone.ai/profitability?utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a0&amp;utm_content=a58.040324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">20% commission</a>, which is only charged on winning trades. The core, original investment isn&#8217;t eroded since it only comes out of successful trades. Itâs also worth keeping in mind that the money from commissions goes back into safeguarding your capital. Half goes towards platform operations, including 24/7 live support, technical maintenance, and risk management teams, while the other half pays out compensation for losing trades.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/bp1d0LAgyD7E3hW0Wo3EoIb4jf8k7PQcT3lNX63Cs-oGRsS5ZiaCNvc6b_ckFIFy8wYFeYlBfYAuGKWDz8L9VWxLxMTWRc1gUIy4cJQliHv9ic6dLTiBgYOHH8nMvSEA12KE815zmdCp9_3V79pGLg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>AlgosOne is offering a highly advanced AI trading tool that mitigates crypto risk and optimizes profits for a rapidly growing global client base. To test drive the system, without funds to a 12-month contract, <a href="https://app.algosone.ai/registration?utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a0&amp;utm_content=a58.040324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sign up via the app</a>, any time, for a 2-week commitment-free trial.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Trump's planned regulatory approach to crypto has seen him favored by registered crypto voters in the upcoming election.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Recent data from a Paradigm poll reveals that 48% of US crypto owners are leaning towards Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential race, with 39% favoring Joe Biden and 13% still undecided.</strong></p>



<p>This is a change from the 2020 election, where 43% of owners recalled voting for Biden and 39% for Trump.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-crypto-could-swing-us-elections">How Crypto Could Swing US Elections</h2>



<p>Around 19% of voters hold or plan to invest in cryptocurrency, and around 11 million registered voters own more than $1000 worth of cryptocurrency. A little over a quarter of undergraduates, who comprised a notable portion of Trump&#8217;s voter base in the primaries, also own crypto. Therefore, new and old crypto supporters could be crucial in the 2024 elections.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://policy.paradigm.xyz/writing/March-2024-Polling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pivot</a> towards Trump among crypto investors may be due to several factors. The Biden Administration&#8217;s regulatory actions against certain <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-crypto-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto companies</a> and activities may have alienated some investors. </p>



<p>The US Treasury Department recently chastened <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto exchange</a> Binance for its lax money laundering controls, while the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) crypto case, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple vs SEC</a>, occurred during Biden&#8217;s watch.</p>

<p>However, former White House Director of Communications Anthony Scaramucci thinks that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/united-states-president-joe-biden-bitcoin-positive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Biden can impact Bitcoin</a> and financial markets in a more positive way. His upholding traditional hierarchical societal structures is good for crypto, the SkyBridge Capital CEO said. Scaramucci served for 11 days during Trump&#8217;s previous term.</p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/donald-trump-support-bitcoin-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump&#8217;s administration&#8217;s proposed support for Bitcoin and crypto </a>has been refreshing for US crypto investors, perhaps contributing to the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-gop-college-graduates-boomerang-conservatives-desantis-haley-2024-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">surge</a> in undergraduate constituents. His new sneakers, which could be bought with digital currencies, convinced him of the size of the crypto market.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;There has been a lot of use of [Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies] and I&#8217;m not sure I want to take them away at this point,&#8221; Trump said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Trump has been a notable critic of the Federal Reserve and promised to replace Jerome Powell as Chair. This could suggest a policy shift to more favorable cryptocurrencies. Higher bond yields under Trump&#8217;s administration could also make Bitcoin an attractive hedge against economic instability. </p>

Trump previously said he would <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trump-digital-dollar-campaign-never-allow-cbdc-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never allow a CBDC if elected president</a>.

<p><strong>Dogecoin price has always responded to news of Tesla founder Elon Musk engaging with the meme coin. The same was expected this week.</strong></p>



<p>However, the broader market conditions weighed much more heavily on the price action, resulting in DOGE seeing red on the chart.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogecoin-feigns-no-more">Dogecoin Feigns No More</h2>



<p>Dogecoin&#8217;s price first reacted to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/elon-musk-insider-trading-lawsuit-dogecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elon Musk in 2021 and has since formed a bond</a> with Tesla&#8217;s founder. This bond weakened over the last year as Musk&#8217;s interest shifted from DOGE to Artificial Intelligence.</p>



<p>However, the DOGE community rejoiced this week as Musk went on to speak in favor of the meme coin. During a session at Tesla&#8217;s Berlin Gigafactory, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/elon-musk-teases-dogecoin-payment-tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musk stated that </a>Dogecoin would be enabled as a means of payment for Tesla purchases. He went on to call the dog token the &#8220;people&#8217;s crypto.&#8221;</p>



<p>Surprisingly, this did not impact the Dogecoin price in any capacity and even failed to prevent a drawdown. DOGE is set to initiate a downtrend owing to the broader market cues.</p>

<p>Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin prices have declined considerably, and Dogecoin prices have followed the same trend. Since the meme coin shares a high correlation of 0.89 with BTC, it was directly influenced.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the cryptocurrency notes no support from its investors, who have begun falling back as the bullish momentum wanes. The addresses that have been conducting transactions on the network have declined considerably.</p>



<p>The bullish community did not contribute to actual activity on-chain, bringing the active addresses down to a four-week low.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-doge-price-prediction-a-20-correction-cannot-be-ruled-out">DOGE Price Prediction: A 20% Correction Cannot Be Ruled Out</h2>



<p>Looking at the daily chart, it can be seen that the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/doge-price-double-golden-crossover-bullish-trend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogecoin price is not too far from beginning a downtrend</a>. The first signal comes from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).</p>



<p>MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security&#8217;s price. It consists of a MACD line (the difference between a short-term and a long-term exponential moving average) and a signal line (a moving average of the MACD line).</p>



<p>At the time of writing, these averages are forming a bearish crossover for the first time in a month. Usually, these crossovers are followed by considerable corrections since the market is still cooling down. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/doge-price-prediction-reclaim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the case of DOGE</a>, a fall to $0.147 or $0.134 is possible, marking a 12% or 20% correction, respectively.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is still positive, sitting underneath the candlestick. If this level continues acting as a support, Dogecoin price could have a shot at recovery, bouncing off $0.164.</p>



<p>If <a href="https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-skyrocketed-will-history-repeat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOGE successfully manages to breach</a> through $0.182, the bearish thesis would be invalidated, opening the meme coin up to a rally to $0.20.</p>
