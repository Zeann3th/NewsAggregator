[{"article_title":"AI Regulation Debate Spurs Union Attention at California Privacy Agency","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Emman Omwanda"},"article_detailed_content":"The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) has taken a significant step forward in its endeavor to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) usage, especially concerning consumer and worker data. Amidst lobbying efforts from both unions and the tech sector, the agency\u2019s board voted 3-2 to advance rules governing the deployment of AI and the collection of personal information. This development marks a crucial moment in the ongoing debate surrounding privacy, technology, and worker rights in the state. Union advocacy for worker AI protections Labor unions in California are redoubling their efforts to influence the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), seeking to establish robust safeguards around the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in workplaces. This renewed focus marks a significant lobbying initiative as unions confront the formidable influence of the state\u2019s tech sector. The regulations under consideration by the CPPA are a direct response to the California Consumer Privacy Act, which extends privacy protections to employees alongside consumers. The proposed regulations drafted by the CPPA encompass a wide array of AI applications in the workplace, spanning decision-making processes related to employment, housing, insurance, healthcare, and education. Of particular significance is the provision granting individuals the right to opt out of AI-driven assessments, such as those conducted during job interviews, without fear of facing discrimination. Moreover, businesses would be obligated to disclose their utilization of AI technologies and provide transparency regarding the use of personal data for predictive purposes. Implications of enhanced worker AI rights If implemented, these regulations would represent a significant milestone in ensuring worker protection amidst the increasing integration of AI in various aspects of employment. By empowering individuals with the right to opt out of AI-based assessments and requiring businesses to be transparent about their AI usage, these regulations aim to mitigate the potential risks of algorithmic bias and discrimination in the workplace. Additionally, they underscore the evolving landscape of privacy rights in the digital age, where the intersection of technology and labor necessitates proactive regulatory measures to safeguard individual autonomy and well-being. Under the proposed rules, businesses exceeding $25 million in annual revenue or processing the personal data of over 100,000 Californians would be subject to regulation. Given California\u2019s status as a hub for AI companies, with a significant proportion of the world\u2019s leading firms headquartered in the state, these regulations could wield substantial influence. Despite progress, more than 20 labor unions and digital rights organizations have raised concerns regarding the latest iteration of the rules. They contend that amendments introduced shortly before the vote have watered down crucial provisions, potentially creating loopholes that could undermine accountability in AI usage. Specifically, changes to the definition of automated decision-making technology have drawn scrutiny, with advocates warning of potential exploitation by businesses. Ongoing debate and future outlook The advancement of AI regulation in California has sparked robust debate, reflecting the complexities surrounding privacy protection, technological advancement, and labor rights. Business interests have weighed in, advocating for exemptions and expressing reservations about the breadth of the proposed regulations. However, proponents argue that comprehensive regulation is essential to safeguard individuals\u2019 privacy and prevent algorithmic bias and discrimination. As the CPPA progresses in shaping AI regulations, stakeholders from various sectors continue to engage in dialogue and advocacy efforts. The outcome of this regulatory process will have far-reaching implications, not only for California but potentially serving as a model for AI regulation nationwide. As discussions evolve and the regulatory landscape takes shape, the balancing act between technological innovation and privacy protection remains at the forefront of policymaking efforts in the Golden State.","article_summary":"The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) has taken a significant step forward in its endeavor to regulate artificial intelligence (AI) usage, especially concerning consumer and worker data.

For enthusiasts of meme coins, the newly-introduced \u201cPEPE\u201d coin is one not to be overlooked. It has established a remarkable benchmark, experiencing an extraordinary surge of nearly 7,000% since its debut in April 2023. Memecoins, themed after popular memes, exemplify this trend, with Pepecoin being a prime example. Pepecoin drew inspiration from the \u201cPepe the Frog\u201d meme, originally featured in Matt Furie\u2019s comic \u201cBoy\u2019s Club.\u201d The initial market dynamics of Pepecoin were significantly influenced by frog-themed memes propagated by its creators and supporters on social platforms. Pepecoin demonstrates how crypto communities can unite around cultural symbols, often overlooking the underlying economic fundamentals of the asset. It follows in the footsteps of dog-themed meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Dogecoin gained prominence with backing from billionaire Elon Musk, achieving a market capitalization of $10 billion. Shiba Inu, meanwhile, boasts a market cap exceeding $5 billion. Pepecoin, by contrast, currently holds a more modest market cap of around $464 million, which is far less than its peak value of $1.5 billion in May 2023. Following its remarkable bull run, the well-known meme coin Pepe has recently experienced a slowdown. However, even with this downturn, large investors are still actively acquiring PEPE. This raises an important consideration: is investing in Pepe a worthwhile decision? Can it surpass the dominance of leading meme coins, including Shiba Inu and Dogecoin? How Much is Pepe Coin Worth Today? The current price of Pepe today stands at $0.0000075, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45.06M. It has a current market cap of $595M and holds a market dominance of 0.04%. The PEPE price has seen a 2.8% increase in the last 24 hours. Pepe Coin achieved its peak on May 5, 2023, reaching the highest price paid of $0.000004408. The record lowest price for Pepe Coin is not specified, but it hit a cycle low at $0.0000006088 following its all-time high. Conversely, the highest price Pepe Coin attained since its last cycle low was $0.051455, marking the cycle high. Talking about how many pepe coins there are, the amount is currently at 417.5 trillion, which is the current circulating supply. Pepe price analysis: PEPE price continues to consolidate around $0.000008 TL; DR Breakdown PEPE price analysis shows that Pepe coin initiated a consolidation around $0.000008 Resistance for Pepe is present at $0.00000852 Support for PEPE/USDT is present at $0.00000592 The PEPE price analysis for 25 March confirms that PEPE price continues to witness a tough battle among traders in validating a clear trend. However, buyers defend the $0.000006 level strongly. Pepe Coin price analysis 1-day chart: PEPE price fails to meet buyers\u2019 demand Analyzing the daily price chart of Pepe coin, Pepe\u2019s price is witnessing intense selling pressure as the price attempts to break above $0.000008. Currently, PEPE price is facing a surge in selling confidence as the price struggles near Fib levels. The 24-hour volume has surged to $241 million, showing an increased interest in trading activity today. Pepe\u2019s price is trading at $0.0000075, increasing by over 2.8% in the last 24 hours. The RSI-14 trend line has declined from its previous level and currently trades around the midline at level 54, hinting at a selling dominance. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. PEPE/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for further declines The 4-hour Pepe price chart suggests that bears are increasing their domination near the immediate support line as PEPE price tumbles around resistance channels at $0.000008. However, bulls aim to gain control by holding the price above EMA20 trend line. The BoP indicator is trading in a positive region at 0.5, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed bearish candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders\u2019 confidence. What to expect from PEPE price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that Pepe attempts to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a further recovery rally in the upcoming hours. If Pepe\u2019s price successfully holds its momentum above $0.00000852, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.00001081. If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000592, which may begin a bearish trend to $0.00000503. Is PEPE A Good Investment? Reviewing the Pepe project\u2019s roadmap, it appears there are no specific future plans detailed, other than an anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction, and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project\u2019s price growth potential may be capped. However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements. This was evident when Pepe\u2019s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2024 could potentially propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH. Recent News Pepe Burns $5.5 Million: In October, Pepe saw a burning of 6.9 trillion tokens. This move, which reduces the total supply, has diminished concerns about the team\u2019s large token holdings, now worth $3.72 million. Following this, new advisors were brought on to strategize the use of the remaining tokens for partnerships and marketing. This development comes after a recent incident where several developers allegedly made unauthorized transfers of Pepe tokens. Pepe Rug Pull: Pepe Coin is embroiled in controversy, with claims of it being a scam emerging on social media. An anonymous developer from the team accused three members of stealing 16 trillion tokens, about 60% of the total supply, from Pepe\u2019s multi-signature wallet and selling them on exchanges, citing internal strife and greed as the cause of the issue.

Pepe Coin: A Quick Overview The official Twitter account of PEPE coin brands it as the \u201cmost memeable memecoin ever,\u201d playfully noting that it\u2019s time for a change from the dog-themed meme coin era, like the once-famed Dogecoin. PEPE made its debut on April 17 with modest initial attention. It draws its theme from the Pepe the Frog meme, created by Matt Furie in 2005, which has been linked to various trends, including the alt-right movement. Despite its thematic roots, PEPE has no formal affiliation with Furie or the original cartoon character. Additional features that underscore PEPE\u2019s memecoin status include its total supply of 420 million tokens, a nod to the 4/20 date celebrated in cannabis culture. Analysts call PEPE coin a \u2018meme takeover.\u2019 For context, Dogecoin (DOGE) required nearly four years to exceed a market capitalization of $1 billion. In stark contrast, Pepe Coin achieved this milestone within just three weeks of its introduction. Despite the significant price fluctuations of $PEPE since that time, the count of individual investors remains notably high. The official website of Pepe Coin states that $PEPE holds no inherent value and does not promise any financial return. However, unofficially, it\u2019s noteworthy that over a hundred thousand investors have acquired $PEPE through Binance and other major cryptocurrency exchanges. PEPE\u2019s Project Changes In August 2023, the Pepe Coin community was alarmed by the unexpected transfer of 16 trillion $PEPE tokens (valued at approximately $15 million USD) from the project\u2019s multi-signature wallet to various centralized exchanges. This incident, once reported in the media, led to a substantial decline in the meme coin\u2019s value. Concerns about the future of $PEPE were voiced by community members across social media platforms. In an attempt to clarify the situation, a representative with access to the project\u2019s official communication account provided an explanation for these mysterious transfers. This was presumably aimed at reassuring the community. Contrarily, the statement only heightened concerns. The explanation revealed that disgruntled developers from the Pepe Coin team were behind the unauthorized access and transfer of tokens from the multi-signature wallet, purportedly under the guise of \u201cupdating\u201d the wallet. These developers had since parted ways with the project. The individual managing the project\u2019s communication account categorically labeled these former developers as culprits, accusing them of theft and subsequent sale of the stolen tokens. Throughout September, the value of Pepe Coin continued its downward trend despite assurances that the tokens in the multi-signature wallet were secure and being managed by an individual committed to the welfare of the community and the remaining $PEPE tokens. In October, a significant development was announced via the official Pepe Coin communication account. They introduced a new advisory team to lead the project. The announcement also included the news that 6.9 trillion $PEPE tokens, equivalent to about $6,000,000, had been burned, effectively reducing the total available supply of the project. This action of burning tokens, combined with the news of the new advisory team, sent a positive message to investors about the ongoing development and management of the project. Consequently, these developments contributed to an increase in the price of $PEPE. How Does Pepe Coin Work? The PEPE coin was informally created as a nod to the widely recognized internet meme \u201cPEPE the Frog,\u201d which became popular in the early 2000s. It lacks a structured team or a defined development roadmap. Despite its absence of fundamental backing, PEPE swiftly ascended into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, reaching the 70th position on CoinMarketCap within just two weeks of its inception. PEPE coin commenced trading on April 15, 2023, at approximately $0.000000001 per coin, and at the time of this writing, its value stands at $0.000001116 per coin. The official website of the PEPE coin candidly states, \u201cPEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.\u201d Contrary to this statement, PEPE was designed to leverage the meme coin craze, similar to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others. Its primary distinction lies in its thematic inspiration; while Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are dog-themed, PEPE is frog-themed. PEPE Coin incorporates a deflationary mechanism where a small fraction of tokens is burned with each transaction. This approach aims to create scarcity and potentially enhance the value of the remaining tokens over time. Additionally, PEPE uses a redistribution model, where a part of each transaction is allocated among existing token holders. This strategy is intended to foster user engagement and encourage long-term investment in the coin. Pepe Price Forecast: Price History The origins of PEPE coin remain shrouded in mystery. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, it didn\u2019t employ common methods like an initial coin offering (ICO), presale, or airdrop for token distribution. Instead, the coin\u2019s emergence and popularity are solely attributed to the appeal of the \u201cPEPE the Frog\u201d meme among potential investors. It\u2019s important to note that there is no known connection between PEPE coin and Matt Furie, the original creator of the \u201cPEPE the Frog\u201d meme. The identities of PEPE coin\u2019s creators are still undisclosed, with the only known fact being its launch around mid-April 2023. Details regarding the team behind PEPE are sparse. However, despite the lack of clear information about its creators, PEPE has garnered significant attention on social media platforms like Twitter and Telegram. This visibility has rapidly cultivated a community around the meme coin. Pepe coin quickly gained attention shortly after its discreet launch in mid-April, with its first notable activity on Etherscan recorded on April 18. The coin\u2019s value surged dramatically right from the start, jumping from $0.00000006036 to $0.0000004002 within the first three days, a remarkable 563% increase. This rapid growth sparked discussions about Pepe\u2019s potential as a top meme coin. Following a brief period of price correction and stabilization, Pepe\u2019s value began a significant ascent on April 30, soaring 214% in just two days to reach a new all-time high. This surge was attributed by Binance to large-scale buying by major investors. Pepe\u2019s momentum continued, with the meme coin achieving a staggering market capitalization of $1.8 billion and an all-time high price of $0.000004354. This peak coincided with Binance\u2019s announcement on May 5 that it would list Pepe. However, this upward trend was short-lived, as early investors quickly began taking profits, leading to a downward price trend. After reaching its all-time high, the volatility of Pepe significantly decreased, with both buying and selling pressures appearing to diminish. The token experienced a significant sell-off on August 24th and 25th, 2023, losing nearly 27% of its value. According to a statement on Pepe\u2019s official communication channel, this drop was due to a malicious team member who misappropriated and sold funds from the Pepe multi-signature wallet. On October 19th, in tandem with Bitcoin\u2019s late-2023 rally, Pepe also experienced a resurgence. The coin burned 1.6% of its total supply, totalling 6.9 trillion tokens. This action helped Pepe break out of its long-standing downward trend, climbing 104% in eight days and surpassing the $0.000001 mark again. Since then, the coin has been trading relatively steadily, yet to retest the crucial support level of $0.000001. More On Pepe Coin Pepe Coin Vs. Pepe 2.0 Pepecoin (PEPE) witnessed an exceptional surge in the meme cryptocurrency market, recording an increase of over 35,000% within its first three months. The token\u2019s viability hinged mostly on speculation within social media circles, suggesting that a touch of real-world application might have been beneficial. The launch of a derivative platform, PEPE 2.0, which shared the limelight with the original $PEPE, resulted in a shift in investor interest. While Pepecoin ($PEPE) experienced its first-ever four-day consecutive loss, PEPE 2.0 saw a price increase over the same weekend. PEPE 2.0 emerged in June as a spin-off from the original Pepecoin (PEPE) platform, about three months after $PEPE\u2019s debut. It was created by some $PEPE investors aiming to replicate the initial success of $PEPE, but with improvements to address perceived shortcomings of the original token. The launch of PEPE 2.0 attracted significant investor attention, leading to a roughly 1,000% increase in its value within ten days, seemingly at the expense of the original Pepecoin (PEPE). In contrast to Pepecoin (PEPE), PEPE 2.0 incorporates a 1% transaction tax intended to fund development initiatives for the platform. According to official statements, PEPE 2.0 is designed to incentivize token holders and foster a sustainable ecosystem. The developers have also renounced the smart contract address, demonstrating their commitment to the platform\u2019s security and integrity. What Influences The Price Of Pepe? Several key factors contributed to Pepe\u2019s significant price surge, and they could continue to influence its value in the future. Here are the main ones: Exchange Listings: Pepe\u2019s value soared following its listing on the Binance exchange. It\u2019s now traded on various top-tier exchanges. A potential listing on another high-profile exchange like Coinbase could lead to another price hike. Meme Coin Narratives: Pepe spearheaded the recent meme coin trend. Its rise in value triggered similar increases in other new meme coins. In future phases of meme-coin popularity, Pepe could experience further surges. Bitcoin Halving Impact: The Bitcoin Halving, a scheduled event every four years that halves the creation of new Bitcoin, often initiates a bull market. The next Halving in April 2024 could positively impact Pepe\u2019s price both before and after the event. Future Developments: To reach valuations like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, Pepe needs to offer more utility to its users. Announcements about Pepe\u2019s future development could greatly affect its market value. On the flip side, if Pepe continues to function solely as a meme coin without added utility, it might struggle to sustain demand, potentially leading to a decline in its price over time. Best Place To Buy PEPE Since its 2023 release, Pepe has been featured on several leading crypto exchanges, with Binance being a notable inclusion. Binance distinguishes itself with its competitive fee structure, diverse features, and a range of payment options. If you\u2019re interested in joining the trend and investing in PEPE coin, here are the steps to purchase it through cryptocurrency exchanges where it\u2019s available: Account Creation and Verification: Register for an account on the exchange\u2019s website or app. Complete the identity verification process. Existing Account Login: If you already have an account on the exchange, simply log in using your existing credentials. Buying Crypto: Navigate to the \u201cBuy Crypto\u201d section on the exchange\u2019s website. This will display the available options in your region. At this point, you might consider purchasing a stablecoin first, which can then be traded for PEPE. Payment Method: Complete the purchase of PEPE using your preferred payment method, such as a bank credit or debit card, bank deposit, or a peer-to-peer (P2P) service. Storing PEPE: Once you have purchased PEPE, you have the option to store it in your personal cryptocurrency wallet or keep it in your account on the exchange. Is the Pepe Hype Over? Pepe, a meme coin with a dedicated community, has seen its hype diminish recently as investors shift their focus to utility tokens. However, market trends are often cyclical, with liquidity fluctuating between different types of investments. Aware of these trends, the meme coin sector anticipates future developments like exchange listings and ecosystem enhancements, potentially increasing Pepe\u2019s value and sparking long-term interest. Remarkably, Pepe soared to a $1.8 billion market cap during its peak but now sits at $477 million despite lacking inherent utility. This speculative nature renders it a high-risk investment. The rapid growth of Pepe Coin has led to the emergence of numerous variants, attracting investors who are either seeking alternatives or hoping to capitalize on these new coins early, much like they did with Pepe. Considering these dynamics, it\u2019s premature to declare the end of Pepe\u2019s popularity. In the next bull market, Pepe might align with broader market trends and possibly enhance its value through strategic updates. Conclusion The frog-themed meme coin PEPE, rapidly gaining popularity in the cryptocurrency market, has been a boon for its early adopters, offering substantial profits. It has even surpassed established meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, attracting a mix of criticism and a strong fanbase. This surge is evident in its increasing holder base, trading volume, and social media footprint, leading to speculation about its future growth. However, PEPE\u2019s foundation lacks solidity and intrinsic value, traits typical of meme coins, casting doubt on the longevity of its current success. Its future, like that of other meme coins, remains highly speculative in the volatile crypto market. Historically, the crypto industry has seen a few \u201crags-to-riches\u201d stories with cultural phenomena like meme coins. Only a couple, namely DOGE and SHIB, have maintained their value in bear markets and performed well as investments. PEpeCoin may be emerging as the third notable example in this trend, but it\u2019s too early to predict the long-term viability of meme coins. For meme coins like PepeCoin to be considered a stable asset class, they must endure through various Bitcoin cycles, achieve significant milestones, such as reaching a $1 trillion market cap, and form substantial, culture-driven ecosystems within the crypto world.

According to the report, a significant proportion of large companies in the country are actively disadvantaging applicants who utilize artificial intelligence (AI) services to craft their resumes, with 65.4% of respondents indicating negative consequences for such submissions. Survey highlights industry response The survey, based on responses from human resource managers at the nation\u2019s top 500 companies by sales, unveiled that 65.4% of respondents expressed disapproval of AI-assisted resumes. Of these, 42.4% stated they would downgrade their evaluation, while 23.2% admitted they would outright reject such applications. The prevailing sentiment among these firms was that AI-generated resumes lacked originality and creativity, thereby hindering the applicant\u2019s chances. Despite the widespread negative perception of AI-crafted resumes, the survey also revealed a significant gap in companies\u2019 ability to detect their usage. A staggering 73% of firms admitted to not having systems in place to determine whether a resume was AI-assisted. Only a minority, comprising 18.7% of respondents, outsourced the task of identifying AI-written resumes to third-party agencies. Meanwhile, a mere 8.3% of companies boasted internal mechanisms to filter out such submissions. Implications for job seekers The findings of this survey carry significant implications for job seekers in South Korea, particularly those considering the use of AI services for resume writing. With a majority of companies expressing disfavor toward AI-assisted resumes, applicants may find themselves at a disadvantage in the competitive job market. The lack of mechanisms for detecting AI involvement further complicates the situation, leaving many applicants vulnerable to potential discrimination based on resume composition. As the use of AI in various aspects of recruitment continues to evolve, stakeholders in South Korea\u2019s job market may need to revisit their attitudes and practices concerning AI-crafted resumes. While concerns regarding originality and creativity are valid, overlooking qualified candidates solely based on resume composition could result in missed opportunities for both employers and applicants. Additionally, the absence of effective mechanisms for detecting AI involvement underscores the need for further research and development in this area. The survey\u2019s findings underscore a prevalent bias against AI-crafted resumes among South Korean firms, with a majority expressing disapproval of such submissions. However, the lack of mechanisms to detect AI involvement highlights a significant practice gap. Moving forward, stakeholders must consider the implications of their attitudes toward AI-assisted resumes and work toward fostering a fair and inclusive recruitment process that prioritizes merit and qualifications above all else.","article_summary":"AI-Crafted a recent Labor Ministry and the Korea Employment Information Service survey has shed light on a concerning trend in South Korea\u2019s job market.

Polygon Overview Polygon serves as a multi-layered protocol suite aimed at resolving the scalability challenges associated with the Ethereum network. By operating a separate but compatible blockchain, Polygon efficiently processes transactions before syncing them back to the main Ethereum chain. This method alleviates the strain on the Ethereum network, enabling faster transaction speeds and reducing costs to a fraction of a cent. Previously known as Matic Network, Polygon offers a user-friendly framework that allows both new and existing blockchain projects to operate on the Ethereum platform without worrying about scalability constraints. With Polygon, users can seamlessly engage with decentralized applications (DApps) without concerns over network bottlenecks. The company is led by CEO Jaynti Kanani, who co-founded the project with Sandeep Nailwal, the Chief Operating Officer, and Anurag Arjun, the Chief Product Officer. The team initially launched the project as Matic Network in 2017. Polygon Price History According to Polygon\u2019s plan, all Matic coins will be released by December 2022, which is good news for long-term investors because it guarantees significant future gains. Since its inception in 2017, Matic tokens have had an incredible run that has withstood the test of unforgiving crypto market turmoil that usually ends up wiping out invalid tokens. Despite the prevailing bearish trend currently experienced in the crypto market, experts are convinced by Matic\u2019s crypto price prognosis and price forecast data that indicate an overall bullish trend for the long-term investment horizon. Based on Coingecko\u2019s data, Polygon has recorded impressive gains since its launch back in 2017. The crypto token has recorded incredible gains of up to 44157.6%, and the rally is expected to continue in the following years. Matic recorded its all-time low price of $0.003143 in May 2019 during the famous bearish run. However, since then, the coin has continued to make significant gains until May 2021, when it recorded a new all-time high price of $2.62. It seems then that May is the month of Polygon, after all. Polygon\u2019s price has been on the rise since it hit a high of $1 at the end of July, and experts are predicting that as Polygon\u2019s network continues to grow with new partnerships and adoption, the value of its token could go even higher. In August, Polygon\u2019s price hovered around the $0.80 mark, but many believe that this is just the beginning of this promising project. Recently, in November, Polygon saw a significant surge after the bullish news that the social media giant Meta is teaming up with the blockchain to deliver its journey into the world of Web3 and NFTs. Stephane Kasriel, head of commerce and financial technologies at Meta, revealed that Instagram businesses will soon be able to create and sell their own NFTs (non-fungible tokens). This service would first launch on the Polygon blockchain before expanding to others, including Solana. MATIC rocketed after this news and hit a high of $1.29 on 7 November. After peaking and later announcing multiple partnerships, including an NFT marketplace deal with Nike, MATIC eventually fell below the $1 barrier. Just this past year, Polygon (@0xPolygon) has rolled out some incredible features on Twitter. From the launch of a new Token List service to mobile burning capabilities for MATIC tokens, they have allowed users to interact with MATIC in an efficient and secure manner. This means you can now access the MATIC burn console through your mobile wallet with a simplified interface that is easy to use. More on Polygon (MATIC) What\u2019s Polygon (MATIC)?

Its growing suite of products offers developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions: L2 solutions, sidechains, hybrid solutions, stand-alone and enterprise chains, data availability solutions, and more. Polygon\u2019s scaling solutions have widespread adoption with 3000+ applications hosted, 1B+ total transactions processed, ~100M+ unique user addresses, and $5B+ in assets secured. Mina Protocol and Polygon are working towards implementing support for Mina on Polygon PoS. This bridge will enable developers building applications on Polygon to leverage privacy and verifiability via Mina\u2019s zero knowledge-SNARK-based protocol. Polygon Use Cases Ethereum-based Polygon hopes to solve fundamental issues the Ethereum blockchain faces, such as interoperability and scalability. It is the first project on the Ethereum blockchain to launch an adequately structured tool that addresses the Ethereum scaling problem. Consequently, many have termed Polygon as an Ethereum scaling solution. Rather than running on its own blockchain, MATIC tokens are traded on the Ethereum blockchain. That\u2019s because Polygon was developed to help scale Ethereum through side chains. MATIC allows you to stake on the Ethereum blockchain and pay for currency transactions. This has helped reduce the high transaction costs inherent in the Ethereum blockchain, helping promote widespread adoption. Another thing, Ethereum is home to several DeFi projects like the Polygon, formerly known as the Matic network. Since the Matic network has brought numerous functionalities to the entire Ethereum blockchain, several developers have taken an interest in the project, which has, in turn, led to steady growth of Matic price. Major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc., witnessed a slump on the 1st week of June, and yet, the value of Polygon(MATIC) rose nearly 35% in the same period. Investors saw Polygon (MATIC) as the next big thing, and in a short period, it surged past other cryptos to rank among the top 15 biggest cryptos globally. Polygon successfully converts the limited Ethereum blockchain into an open blockchain network usable by many. In essence, it makes Ethereum steady as the internet of blockchains. In turn, Polygon (Matic) project benefits immensely from the already-established Ethereum blockchain in several ways. Firstly, every blockchain project needs a secure security infrastructure; the Matic network benefits from Ethereum\u2019s array of qualities, such as an active and vibrant community, established security systems, and transparency. Within the Polygon network, transactions are settled using the Matic coin. Matic price has risen over the years, sparking interest from cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Polygon technology has improved efficiency within the Ethereum blockchain. Today, Polygon boasts of handling up to 65,000 transactions per second on its single sidechain. Similarly, it has averaged an impressive block confirmation time of two seconds per transaction. Pros and cons of investing in Polygon (Matic) Polygon, formerly Matic network, has been considered a stable investment by crypto enthusiasts. Anyone interested in Ethereum and its bundle of projects likely has an affinity for Matic. It is a well-structured organization with clear goals of extending the scalability of the Ethereum blockchain and making cryptocurrency more accessible to the public. If the project continues to push forward strides, its success is inevitable, and consequently, Matic holders will benefit significantly. Investing is a full-time activity that requires individuals to analyze potential risks and returns before committing. However, within the crypto world, numerous uncertainties shape the prices of crypto coins. Therefore, even for a seasoned professional, it is challenging to make precise predictions on the price of a coin based on historical price actions alone. However, for an individual to earn impressive returns on their investments, they must take risks. Here, we\u2019ll discuss some of the benefits of investing in the Polygon ecosystem. Pros of investing in Matic Since Matic is a scaling solution on the Ethereum blockchain, it is difficult to foresee its downfall. Therefore, most forecasts are convinced that Polygon will be in existence for years to come. So what are some of the pros of investing in this token? It provides new scaling solutions to the Ethereum ecosystem, ensuring a bright future and allowing investors to make long-term investments. Since 67% of the tokens are already in circulation, and the maximum supply is expected to be realized by December 2022, the coin offers immense growth potential in 2022 and beyond, allowing investors to reap more profits. Matic allows for the interconnection of blockchain networks, a scaling solution that assures investors of Matic\u2019s future performance. Polygon is supported by a strong community of developers that ensures the project performs well and consequently maintains and increases Matic\u2019s price level. Cons of investing in Matic It is indeed public knowledge that investments always come with a degree of risk. Investing in Matic may result in losses if careful considerations of the involved risks aren\u2019t well conducted. Below are some possible shortcomings of investment in Matic. Recently, the Polygon network was hacked, and the perpetrators made away with millions worth of Matic tokens. The hacking was a huge red flag for investors since it indicates that the network isn\u2019t as secure as it should be. Price volatility. Every cryptocurrency experiences volatility; however, when dealing, sometimes crypto coins experience extreme price drops that may hurt an individual\u2019s portfolio. Since Matic already competes with Avalance, Polkadot, and Cosmos, it is unclear who will win the race. Therefore, for a long time horizon, investors should keep tabs and know when to exit. Conclusion Despite the short-term volatility, Polygon\u2019s investors remain confident that it can reach double digits in no time. For instance, Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) confidently tweeted about his MATIC holdings expecting it to hit $10 soon. Polygon has been actively forging relationships with various companies in the crypto space and staying abreast of current blockchain technology trends. Here are some recent updates, as announced by Polygon: The Polygon Mainnet is now live in Alpha and Beta versions. Support for deposits and withdrawals of all Ethereum-based assets Support of ERC721 to ERC20, ERC20 to ERC20, and ERC721 to ERC721 transactions enabled Increasing the number and capabilities of Proof-of-Stake validators Offering the API and SDK toolkit for dApp infrastructure development Supernets, a new blockchain network, is ready to skyrocket with Polygon\u2019s $100 million investment toward businesses taking advantage of its powerful technology. With partnerships and increased adoption, MATIC prices are expected to continue to surge. If investors and traders can take advantage of these bullish signs, they could enjoy significant profits. However, it is important to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency space is highly volatile and risky so always do your own research before investing. There are many factors influencing the future of MATIC coin, from global economic conditions to the level of adoption of cryptocurrencies. The partnership with Meta and the latest breakout on the platform appear to be positive indicators for the coin\u2019s future price, according to predictions from algorithm-based forecasting sites. Overall, scaling solutions like Polygon are expected to gain momentum as network congestion on the Ethereum blockchain remains an issue. Polygon\u2019s multi-layer technology allows it to authenticate transactions in a matter of seconds while still uploading them to the Ethereum blockchain, combining scalability and security. Polygon\u2019s powerful Dapp architecture makes it simple to build new apps on-chain and port current Ethereum projects. However, MATIC is projected to continue dipping by a few cents before beginning another price increase soon. Before making any investment decisions, do your research.","article_summary":"Polygon Price Prediction 2024-2033 How much is MATIC worth?

Aptos Overview MARKET CAP CIRCULATING SUPPLY ALL-TIME LOW ALL-TIME HIGH POPULARITY $4.66 billion 368,220,999 $3.09 $19.90 #26 Layer-one protocols such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB Smart Chain, and Avalanche have been hot topics in crypto. The astronomical rise of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exposed the limitations of many blockchains struggling to handle mainstream adoption. Before Ethereum\u2019s transition to Proof-of-Stake, network congestion and sky-high transaction fees were prevalent. This led to the belief that only whales could participate in multiple DeFi initiatives on the platform. Though touted as a high-throughput chain capable of processing thousands of transactions per second (TPS), Solana faced its challenges, with multiple outages rendering the network unusable. A new player emerged to solve these issues: the Aptos Blockchain. Dubbed by many as \u201cthe Solana Killer,\u201d Aptos is a \u201cscalable, safe, reliable, and upgradable\u201d network that has been in development for over three years. Aptos aims at revolutionize the blockchain space, offering a seamless and robust platform for users and developers alike. Aptos Price History Aptos raised $200 million in March 2022 in a seed round led by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Other crypto heavyweights like Multicoin Capital and Tiger Global participated in the funding round. In July of the same year, the startup raised another $150 million in a Series A round led by Jump Crypto and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX Ventures. Two months later, Binance Labs invested an undisclosed amount in Aptos, bringing its valuation to $4 billion. The blockchain launched its mainnet on 12 October 2022. APT, the blockchain\u2019s native token, marked its all-time low on December 30, 2022. A month later, tables turned as it peaked at an all-time high of $19.90 on January 30, 2023. On that day, Aptos pumped by over 25% in 24 hours, likely due to the blockchain\u2019s non-fungible token market. Collections such as Aptos Monkeys and Aptomingos have attracted more users. APT was bearish in Q1 2023. On 6th June, APT fell below its initial listing price and extended the losses in the preceding months. In October, it started correcting, rising as high as $8.47 in November. In 2024, it broke above the $10 mark. Source: https://coinstats.app/coins/aptos/ More on the Aptos Network What Is Aptos Blockchain? Aptos, an innovative layer1 blockchain, is built upon the Move programming language and can be considered the successor to Meta\u2019s now-defunct Diem blockchain project. Centered on scalability, reliability, safety, and upgradeability, Aptos aims to bring ground-breaking concepts to the layer one space, featuring novel consensus mechanisms, performance optimization, system security, and smart contract designs. With a vision to recreate the cloud infrastructure that powers web2 in a decentralized manner, Aptos strives to establish a comprehensive blockchain solution that paves the way for rapid mainstream adoption of web3. Concurrently, the project is committed to accelerating a dApp ecosystem that addresses real-world challenges. Founders Behind Aptos Ecosystem Aptos was brought to life by Aptos Labs, a company co-founded by Mo Shaikh (CEO) and Avery Ching (CTO). Shaikh and Ching are former Meta employees with years of experience under their belts as senior developers and engineers in the blockchain industry. Aptos Labs boasts a diverse and experienced team of skilled designers, engineers, researchers, and strategists working together to drive the project forward. A significant factor contributing to the buzz surrounding the Aptos crypto project is its intriguing history. While Aptos is an independent blockchain with its unique vision and technology, it has roots in Meta\u2019s discontinued Diem blockchain initiative. A substantial portion of the Aptos team was directly involved in Diem\u2019s creation, design, and development, adding to the project\u2019s interesting narrative. How Does the Aptos Blockchain Work? PoS with advanced BFT consensus Aptos is a robust proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that employs a sophisticated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism, working with a group of validators responsible for receiving, processing, and validating transactions. Holders of APT tokens can stake their tokens with validators, which grants each validator a consensus voting weight proportional to the number of tokens staked in their custody. Validators can then utilize their voting weight to actively participate in the consensus process and governance of the blockchain. Light and full node clients Aptos categorizes its clients into two distinct groups \u2014 full node and light clients. Full node clients maintain a complete copy of the Aptos transaction ledger, while light clients store a streamlined version. Both types of clients communicate with validators to inquire about the ledger\u2019s history and current state before submitting transactions to be appended. Move programming language Aptos\u2019 whitepaper states that it employs the Move programming language\u2019s object model to depict the state of its ledger. Move, a relatively new programmable platform for blockchains, smart contracts, and other applications, was initially developed for Facebook (now Meta) for its discontinued crypto/blockchain projects, Libra and Diem. The Aptos team asserts that Move\u2019s advanced smart contract language is ideal for facilitating swift and secure transactions. Move simplifies the auditing and analysis of the blockchain and smart contracts that utilize it. Parallel transaction processing The Aptos blockchain supports parallel transaction processing, essential for achieving high scalability and throughput. By optimizing a multi-threaded, in-memory parallel engine using BlockSTM, it can deliver over 160,000 non-trivial Move transactions per second. The underlying infrastructure is designed for complex atomic transactions, ensuring transaction viability protection. Each transaction is fully completed or doesn\u2019t occur at all. This approach enables secure peer-to-peer trustless transactions with no intermediary. The Aptos Token (APT) The Aptos token (APT) is the native cryptocurrency within the Aptos ecosystem. At one point, the project faced controversy when it planned to launch the Aptos token without providing any public information\u2014no details on total supply, distribution, or even a general roadmap. However, after receiving backlash from the community, the Aptos team made amends and shared most of the necessary details through a blog post. The Mainnet officially launched on October 12, 2022, with an initial token supply of 1 billion. APT features eight digits of precision, and each minimal unit is called an Octa. Conclusion Since its inception, Aptos appears to have successfully integrated various projects. This is a promising development, as it expands the ecosystem\u2019s reach and potential for growth. With its current trajectory and sub-second transaction times, the Aptos crypto project holds the potential to surpass many of its rivals in the long run, provided it continues on this path. However, it is advised to research and conduct good investment advice before investing in the volatile crypto market.","article_summary":"Aptos Price Prediction 2024-2033 As we venture into 2024 to 2033, the period is critical for Aptos as it strives to establish itself as a significant blockchain platform.

Recent BTC News/Opinions Spot ETF Outflow: ETFs linked to Bitcoin saw $742 million withdrawn in three days, reflecting a shift from its peak demand. Despite this, they\u2019ve attracted $11.4 billion since launch, with the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust reporting $13.3 billion in outflows. Morgan Stanley In Bitcoin ETF: Morgan Stanley is evaluating the possibility of offering spot bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform, following the SEC\u2019s approval of these products. This move by one of Wall Street\u2019s largest broker-dealers aims to meet growing client interest in cryptocurrencies and could lead to a significant increase in investments once major financial platforms begin offering these ETFs. SEC Approves Spot Bitcoin ETF: U.S. authorities have given the green light to Bitcoin ETFs, significantly expanding the reach of the 15-year-old digital currency.

BTC Price Overview The price of Bitcoin had experienced notable peaks and troughs in its value. Despite this volatility, the unique nature of the Bitcoin network and its limited supply of coins has attracted the attention of investors and traders worldwide. The blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin enables secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries, making it an attractive alternative to traditional financial systems. In recent years, Bitcoin has trended upwards, with significant increases in value occurring in 2017 and 2021. This growth has been driven by a variety of factors, including increased adoption and acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment, as well as speculation by investors and traders. Today, Bitcoin is trading at +56654654.6% above its all-time low in July 2010. While the future of Bitcoin\u2019s price remains uncertain, many experts predict that the trend towards increased adoption and acceptance of digital currencies will continue to drive demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC Price history Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price again reached an all-time high in 2021, as values exceeded over 65,000 USD in November 2021. That particular price hike was connected to the launch of a Bitcoin ETF in the United States, whilst others in 2021 were due to events involving Tesla and Coinbase, respectively. Tesla\u2019s announcement in March 2021 that it had acquired 1.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of the digital coin fueled mass interest. The market was noticeably different by the end of 2022, however, with Bitcoin prices reaching roughly $17194.91 as of January 10, 2023, after another crypto exchange, FTX, filed for bankruptcy. Large BTC holders \u2013 \u2018whales\u2019 \u2013 are said to make up two percent of anonymous ownership accounts, and own approx 92 percent of BTC. As most people who use cryptocurrency-related services worldwide are retail clients rather than institutional investors, Bitcoin prices are difficult to measure, as movements from one large whale already have a significant impact on this market. More on Bitcoin What is Bitcoin? Launched in 2009, Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency powered by blockchain technology. Satoshi Nakamoto created the coin to overcome the shortcomings of government-issued currencies without requiring a controlling authority. Bitcoin (BTC) was created out of the need for a cryptography-based e-payment system rather than the conventional trust-based system. Cryptocurrency acts as a store of value and a payment method for any transaction process in the crypto space. It is often dubbed \u201cdigital gold.\u201d Bitcoin\u2019s current cryptography is based on an impenetrable algorithm (SHA-256) designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) in 2016, after the collapse of the SHA-1 algorithm. This algorithm makes it impossible to crack the Bitcoin network. Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, its value has risen dramatically, from less than 0.01 USD in May 2010 to over 67,000 USD in November 2021. Bitcoin is expected to attain newer feats in the coming years as more institutional investors and traders continue to turn to cryptocurrency. What Influences Bitcoin\u2019s Price? The world\u2019s premier cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has recently taken a substantial hit, dipping below the $25.5K threshold and reaching its lowest value in three months. This downward trend follows a lawsuit initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Binance, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, and its founder and CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The news of this legal dispute sparked a swift wave of Bitcoin selling, causing a ripple effect across the majority of other cryptocurrencies. The market strain has escalated as the SEC has expanded its legal pursuits to encompass Coinbase, another key contender in the cryptocurrency exchange market. Crypto experts posit that if Bitcoin can hold its resistance level at $26,000, we might see a bounce back in the coming months. However, if this level is breached, Bitcoin could potentially tumble to its lowest ever value of $20,000. Yet, the experts also caution that the current rise in interest rates and a more stringent monetary policy might hinder Bitcoin from making a significant recovery in the near term. Despite these hurdles, the year 2023 holds promise for Bitcoin advocates who see it as a \u201cdigital safe-haven\u201d or \u201cvirtual gold\u201d. These enthusiasts are confident that Bitcoin can offer investors a substantial hedge or attractive yields during periods of market instability. Bitcoin Challenges Despite its success, Bitcoin has faced several criticisms, especially its energy-hungry mining system. According to an energy consumption tracker developed by the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin mining was estimated to consume 100 TWh per year, about one-third of the UK\u2019s total energy consumption in 2016. In addition, BTC\u2019s criminality potential has positioned it for more scrutiny, as it has facilitated numerous dark web dealings, such as acquiring illegal weapons, money laundering, etc. The most significant and long-standing challenge of Bitcoin is scalability. Bitcoin\u2019s underlying technology limits its performance in terms of transaction completion timeframe, with an insufficient capacity of 3-7 TPS. As more transactions are initiated on the network, processing delays will surface. Several proposals have been put forward to nip this concern in the bud, but a favorable long-term fix remains unclear. How do you buy and sell Bitcoin? You can buy and sell Bitcoin through cryptocurrency exchanges or peer-to-peer platforms. To purchase Bitcoin, you typically need to create an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, fund your account, and place an order to buy Bitcoin. What is Bitcoin\u2019s role in the broader financial system? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are seen by some as a disruptive force that could challenge traditional financial systems and provide greater financial freedom and autonomy for users. Where to store Bitcoin? The best ways to store Bitcoin include hardware wallets, paper wallets, and software wallets. Hardware wallets are considered the most secure, as they store private keys offline and require physical confirmation of transactions. Paper wallets, which involve printing out private keys and keeping them in a secure location, are also considered secure but require careful handling. Software wallets, which run on computers or mobile devices, are a great option, but more vulnerable to hacking and malware attacks. What drives the value of BTC? Bitcoin\u2019s value is determined by supply and demand factors, such as market sentiment, adoption rates, regulatory changes, and investor speculation. Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, scarcity, and high-security features also contribute to its value in the market. Conclusion As the crypto market leader, Bitcoin cryptocurrency is one digital asset with massive potential for mainstream adoption. Several businesses already accept Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currencies, with the latest club member being the Spanish company Telefonica. The telecommunication giant recently partnered with crypto exchanges Bit2Me to enable settlements in Bitcoin, among other cryptocurrencies. According to our BTC price forecast, Bitcoin\u2019s long-term prospects are looking good, with several possibilities of future price appreciation. Our expectations are also backed by Bitcoin price history. Bitcoin could be a significant portfolio addition for many BTC investors in years to come. However, before you buy Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, do remember to conduct your own research, taking into account all risks involved.","article_summary":"BTC Price Predictions 2024-2033 How much is Bitcoin (BTC) worth?

However, the question of whether to segregate the activities of operating an exchange and a custodian is more nuanced. Large banks often run their trading businesses and their custody businesses in the same legal entity, using information walls to control for conflicts of interest and ensuring that their own assets are segregated from those of their clients. This paper will use the experience of the US grain industry in the late nineteenth century to illustrate the importance of controlling the risks between custody and execution activities. Cryptoasset Custody Cryptoasset custody is a complex undertaking involving, among other things, managing information security risk to protect private keys and keep transactions secure. Custodians also act as a form of payment service provider, receiving cryptoassets and sending them based on the instructions of their clients. Many of the early cryptoasset exchanges bundled custody with execution for their largely retail client base and some continue to do so. When they first launched, the exchanges had to build the capability to safeguard their own assets. Extending this capability to their largely retail client base for free created much stickier client relationships and was an oblique way of monetising the sunk cost of their in-house custody arrangements. Since FTX\u2019s failure there have been both private sector and public sector efforts to change this model. The private sector has seen wider adoption of \u2018Off Exchange Settlement\u2019 (OES) by the large exchanges, often in response to the demand of institutional clients. OES seeks to mitigate counterparty risks by removing the need for clients to keep their cryptoassets at exchanges. This, incidentally, is how Zodia Markets was designed from inception. In the public sphere, there have been regulatory measures such as those by the SEC calling for Investment Advisors to only use Qualified Custodians for their clients\u2019 cryptoassets. There have also been consultations such as the one by HM Treasury in the UK, which signalled support for the segregation of client assets from those of the exchanges those clients use. Cryptoasset Exchanges Cryptoasset exchanges and traditional exchanges had similar origins insofar as most began as informal venues for retail customers. On the cryptoasset side, Coinbase started as a private service to buy and sell Bitcoin through bank transfer, while Mt. Gox started as a trading service for card collectors. In the traditional world, the LSE started out as a private association of traders based in John\u2019s Coffee House in the City of London, while in medieval Belgium traders convened at the Huis ter Beurze, a tavern, which gave its name to the term \u2018bourse\u2019, as in Deutsche Börse. Taking a broader perspective, exchanges are designed to fulfill five functions: Standardization, such as through weights and measures or consistently designed trading contracts, Protection of property rights, such as through rule books, Enforcement of contractual agreements through sanctions for bad actors, Mitigation of information asymmetries by disseminating information, often through a transparent order book and Providing public goods by ensuring rules are adhered to. Judicial and legislative sanctioning of these rules by the state tended to follow, rather than the other way round. Omnibus and Segregated: Elevators and Sacks The development of grain exchanges in the late nineteenth century United States, particularly the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), helps illustrate the tension between custodians on the one hand and exchanges on the other. During the late 1840s and early 1850s, the quantity of grain shipped to Chicago grew dramatically as the United States expanded west. Storage elevators operated by warehousemen were large, specialized warehouses where grain was kept in bins before shipment. In a sense they are equivalent to omnibus cryptoasset custodians where the assets of various owners are commingled in a single wallet. The CBOT started out as a sleepy organisation, even having to encourage attendance at its meetings in the 1850s by providing free meals. The exchange grew to play a role in standardizing the grading, inspection and weighing of commodities, including grain, which is function 1 in the list above. The warehousemen who operated the elevators were at odds with the traders and shippers of the grain, who were more aligned with the exchange. The storage of cryptoassets involves, among other things, the indexing of the chains and asset screening. Blockchain indexing eases the process of finding information stored in the blockchain rather than analyzing data block-by-block. It does this by parsing and storing the data in a centralized database where it can then be queried. Indexing is a form of confirming the on-chain property rights of the custodian\u2019s client. This is function 2. Certainly, clients could do this themselves, but it is much easier to pay a custodian to do it on their behalf. Screening and scoring are a financial crime monitoring measure that has no real equivalent in traditional finance, since it is specific to blockchains. Private firms provide scoring services to assess the financial crime exposure of a particular asset or wallet. If an asset or wallet has recently interacted with an address that is known to be associated with criminal activity, then the score is adversely impacted. This means that the notion that cryptoassets are perfectly fungible is not strictly accurate. Different wallets and assets have different scores. Where custodians operate omnibus wallets, so this affects the score of the overall holdings by commingling assets of different scores. The same was true of grain in that it is not nearly as fungible as one might imagine. There are different grades depending on the growing area, such as Russian Rye wheat, River Plate wheat, East India wheat and so on. Other grading criteria included, for example, moisture content, foreign matter, and damaged grains. The challenge in the United States was the scale and sophistication of the custodial infrastructure that collected grain into elevators before being transported. This was different from countries like Argentina where the infrastructure was less sophisticated, and grain was parceled into sacks for shipping. Custodians that operate separate wallets for each of their clients are analogous to the grain sacks of Argentina. Omnibus grain elevators created economies of scale through quantity and scale. However, this came with the trade-off of making it harder to track quality compared with using grain sacks that could be tagged with a particular grade from the point of packing to arrival at the end customer. In cryptoassets omnibus wallets also create economies of scale, such as reducing on-chain transaction costs, but the scoring of individual sets of assets becomes more challenging if not impossible. The Risks of Comingling and Custodians trading on own account The commingling of grain allowed the warehousemen to engage in unscrupulous practices. For example, they could receive a shipment of grade one grain and then mix it with grade two to the point that it was still just within the acceptable range for a one grade. As a result, the warehouse was able to improve the quality of grain on its own account to the detriment of others. This of course resulted in a dead weight loss for those who had high-quality grain stored at the elevator. This discouraged farmers from ensuring their grain was of the highest quality. Further down the supply chain, shippers engaged in mixing to be as close to the threshold between grades, so the loss to the warehousemen would be minimized. In some senses there is a Gresham\u2019s Law at work, with poor-quality grain driving out good quality grain. In summary, standardization and the protection of property, functions 1 and 2, became flawed. One key difference between cryptoassets and the grain markets is that the grading and scoring of cryptoassets is conducted by third party private sector companies, since the data is public and anyone can do it. However, omnibus wallets do limit this capability since a great deal of trading activity can take place off-chain and then net settle to the omnibus wallet. Another source of tension revolved around function 4. Warehousemen, who could trade on the exchange but also traded off the exchange in private transactions, had information about supply and demand as well as the qualities of grain in storage, thus creating a conflict of interest. While this information was their property and the treatment of information as property does act as an incentive to owners to produce and sell that information, there is a counterargument that mandatory disclosure can help prevent insider trading, market abuse and adverse selection. What is key is where the warehousemen were able to commingle their own assets with those of their clients and where they were able to trade on their own account, they had the temptation to engage in abusive and illicit practices, which put them into conflict with the CBOT. It is no surprise that the responses to HMT\u2019s consultation calling for firm and client assets to be segregated were overwhelming. The CBOT had a long-running conflict with the warehousemen as it struggled to apply the same standardization of weights, measures, and grades as it had in other assets such as lumber. In 1906 the CBOT implemented the Call Rule that required that any private trades concluded off the exchange had to be at the closing price for the day. The warehousemen were more afraid of expulsion from the exchange than the costs of adhering to this rule so they adhered to it. The rule was also given judicial backing on this important market function. This allowed the CBOT to manage the conflict of interest around the warehousemen being able to trade on their own account, but critically that was not done by banning them from trading. All of this meant that the economies of scale of elevators could be retained, while allowing for the conflicts of interest and other issues of tension to be managed. What is readily apparent is that banning elevators or preventing warehousemen from trading was never a realistic option. Technology and the economies of scale that it brought was held to be a fundamental good. Yes, it introduced new risks but over time the market and the regulators were able to manage these novel risks under a model that has operated for over a hundred years. One hopes that the same attitude can be brought to bear in the cryptoasset markets. This is a guest post by Nick Philpott.

When you take self-custody of your own Bitcoin, you and only you are responsible for the safety of your funds. Self-custody also means that no one can freeze your funds, and no one can stop you from making a payment you want to make. It\u2019s a double-edged sword: there are huge benefits to self-custody, but it also comes with responsibility. If you make a mistake and send Bitcoin to the wrong address there is no undoing it. Then if someone can access your seed phrase (seed words), there is no customer support to help you, that person now has access to your money. If you lose your keys and your seed phrase backups, there is no recovery process to get your wallet back. It\u2019s very much like cash in that regard: once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. People generally go through life with no existential anxiety over having small amounts of cash but protecting significant amounts of money presents a source of worry, and Bitcoin is no different. Custody and Crypto Wallets When it comes to managing your Bitcoin, there are multiple types of wallets you can use. However, not all of them offer you true ownership of your assets. Here's a breakdown of the types of wallets you will encounter and how they approach self-custody. Custodial Wallets Custodial wallets are generally offered by centralized exchanges, the same platforms that allow you to buy Bitcoin with fiat currency. These wallets work essentially just like a bank account. You do not actually have any control of your money. They can freeze your funds, lock and close your account, and deny you permission to make transactions or withdrawals with your own money. They do offer the potential to transact very cheaply with other users of the same wallet, but at the cost of giving control over your money to the custodian. They should never be used to store any significant amount of money, and any Bitcoin you purchase should be withdrawn to a non-custodial wallet as soon as possible. Non-Custodial Wallets Non-custodial wallets all offer true self-custody: only you have access to your assets. But even wallets that offer self-custody come with a range of trade-offs. They can also serve different purposes. Software Wallets, also known as hot wallets, run on your mobile phone or your laptop computer. They do leave control over your funds in your own hands, but they manage and store the private keys on your device. This exposes them to the risk of compromise by hackers. You should only protect small amounts of money with a software wallet, what you reasonably expect to spend in a short time period. A hardware wallet is a special device designed to keep your private keys as secure as possible. These devices are what you should use to store the bulk of your Bitcoin. They keep the private key offline and inaccessible to any threat from hackers, and allow signing transactions in a secure environment. A special note when using hardware wallets, the vast majority of them have a screen on the device that is used to display information about where a transaction is being sent before signing. Always double check the address and amounts shown by your device when signing to make sure the money is being sent to the correct place. How to approach Self-Custody Here are some basic steps you can take to ensure you are interacting with your Bitcoin in a safe and secure manner: Test Your Backups The first thing you have to do when taking custody of your own funds is to generate your seed words, also known as a seed phrase. This is like the master key to all of the accounts you will create with that wallet. When you first complete the wallet setup, your wallet will generate a random number called a seed, or entropy. From there, your wallet will translate this number into 12-24 words called a seed phrase, or seed words. Any wallet that is properly designed to encourage user safety should have you verify and prove you wrote down the seed phrase by challenging you on some (or all) of the words in it. If you are managing significant sums of money, it is always safest to double-check. To follow, you will need to generate an \u201caccount\u201d which will create your wallet\u2019s first receiving address, which looks like this: bc1q653jc5hxawj5lwxgm8tt73qzw6rurmc5d42qd2 It never hurts to be safe and double-check things. After you\u2019ve finished setting up your wallet, but before you start transacting, you can reset the wallet and re-initialize it. Instead of generating a new seed phrase, you can import the one you just backed up. If the first Bitcoin address is the same, you can be sure you\u2019ve correctly backed up your seed phrase. Send A Test Transaction When it comes to making your first withdrawal from an exchange it can be a bit nerve-wracking. Is this address correct? Did I make a mistake? One of the scariest things for many people about Bitcoin is the digital nature of it. Everyone has in their mind this image from a movie scene where someone teenage hacker compromises a government system to further the plot. Most people don\u2019t understand the first thing about how computers work, but they understand there are numerous ways they can be compromised or hacked. I don\u2019t know about you, but when there is a risk I am aware of that could affect me and I don\u2019t understand how that risk exposes itself to me, I get worried. Just like verifying your seed phrase by recovering the backup before using the wallet, you can send coins to your wallet slowly. If someone were to compromise how you generated your wallet in the first place, they would be able to take any money you send to that wallet the instant you send it. So just don\u2019t send all of your money at once. Send a small test transaction with a tiny percent of the Bitcoin you intend to take into self-custody. Make sure those funds actually show up in your wallet first. To really be sure, you can even make sure that you can spend those coins by sending them back to the next address in your wallet. After making a test transaction and ensuring that you have the keys needed to spend money sent to that wallet, you can deposit the rest of your money to that wallet. After a small test deposit without seeing such a transaction occur that you didn\u2019t initiate, you can have much greater confidence that your wallet was set up securely. NEVER Create Digital Seed Phrase Backups Your seed phrase backup is your money. Whoever has access to your seed has full access to your funds. There is no customer support line to call, there are no chargebacks or insurance coverage for stolen funds in non-custodial Bitcoin wallets. If you mess this up, what\u2019s done is done. Hardware wallets that you actually use to sign transactions are specifically designed to hold the private keys your seed generates securely. When you make a backup of your seed phrase it should strictly be on something analog; a piece of paper, a steel plate with punched letters, something physical and completely offline. You should NEVER do something like take a screenshot or picture of your seed phrase on your phone, or keep a backup in a text document or Google Cloud or iCloud. People\u2019s computers and internet service accounts get hacked and compromised on a regular basis at very large scales. Only keeping your keys stored on a physical medium like paper, and a secure device like a hardware wallet immensely lowers your risk of your coins being stolen through the compromise of your seed phrase. Your iCloud account can be hacked remotely from anywhere, whereas the seed phrase backup on steel in your safe requires someone to physically break into your safe. Multisig Requires Extra Backups! If you are using a multisig wallet, the seed phrase backups are not enough to recover your funds. The point of multisig is to increase your security by requiring more than one key to sign to spend your money. Typically, they will require a minimum threshold of devices that must sign each transaction. For example, it might require 2 out of 3 signatures. This ensures that someone compromising or you losing a key or two doesn\u2019t result in losing your funds, but it comes with a nuanced catch. You can lose some of the private keys in a multisig, but if you don\u2019t keep all of your public keys, you won\u2019t be able to find your Bitcoin on the blockchain to spend in the future. This is due to how multisig wallets create the information necessary to process transactions. When you make backups for a multisig wallet, each individual private key backup should also be accompanied by a backup of the public keys (wallets will call this an \u201cxpub\u201d) for all of the wallet addresses involved in the multisig. This ensures that you can find your coins on-chain even if you lose access to one of the accounts. Never Talk About Your Stack Being involved in Bitcoin can be a very exciting experience, especially when the price is going up. This can also be a liability depending on who knows about your Bitcoin holdings. As was mentioned earlier, if someone can gain access to your seed phrase they gain access to your money. Bitcoin has the potential to become immensely valuable in the future. Owning Bitcoin is not a fact that you should be parading around to the whole world and everyone you know. Obviously, if you are married it will be very difficult to keep a significant sum of Bitcoin secret from your spouse. If you have very close friends, it's something likely to come up or be observed by them over time. But you don\u2019t have to go telling everyone you meet that you own Bitcoin. And you shouldn\u2019t. As Bitcoin has increased in value over the years, physical attacks on Bitcoiners in order to steal their money have become more and more common. The more people who know you hold Bitcoin, the greater your exposure to potential risks like that. Don\u2019t go blabbing your mouth off to everyone you meet about your Bitcoin stack. Wrapping Up Bitcoin can be, although it shouldn\u2019t be, an intimidating thing to take possession of. It\u2019s just like cash in a way, if you lose it no one can do anything about it. But in other ways, it's not quite like cash at all. People are worried about holding large sums of cash because if you lose it or someone steals it, it\u2019s gone for good. Bitcoin can be backed up. If you lose your Bitcoin, you can literally just magically get it back if you have a backup. That\u2019s because your Bitcoin isn\u2019t in your wallet, your Bitcoin is stored on the blockchain. If you have a copy of your seed phrase you can regain access to all of your BTC no matter which wallet you use. You can\u2019t just \u201cback up\u201d physical cash. A xerox copy of cash isn\u2019t cash, and won\u2019t be treated as such by anyone. But a Bitcoin word seed phrase restores your access to your Bitcoin instantly. That should be an alleviation of anxiety when comparing Bitcoin to something like cash. Multisig wallets offer an option to defend against theft. When you have a safe full of cash at home, someone can simply break into your house and take all of it. With a multisig Bitcoin wallet, if you only have a single key at home with you a thief cannot take your Bitcoin by breaking in and taking the key you have at home. This is something that cash cannot do. Larger amounts of cash are a large incentive for thieves to target you. But if they don\u2019t know you have a large amount of cash, they have no reason to target you. Just don\u2019t tell them about it. Bitcoin isn\u2019t a special variable here. Bitcoin can be intimidating to self-custody because of the risks it shares in common with cash, but when you really take the time to learn what tools are available to help you self-custody it, it's not that intimidating. In many ways, it can be safer than cash to hold yourself. So stop worrying, have a little patience, and slowly take the time to learn the basic things you can do to protect your stack yourself. After a little while you won\u2019t even think twice about it.","article_summary":"It\u2019s important to take bitcoin into self-custody in order to eliminate counterparty risk when holding the asset.

This latest release is now available for immediate testing and seamless integration. Some key highlights of SRI 1.0.0 include: Miners can connect to SV2 pools without upgrading existing SV1 firmware through Translation Proxy or directly using an SV2 firmware device like BraiinsOS. Miners have the flexibility to run their bitcoin nodes, construct templates, and declare them to the SV2 Pool. The implementation of pool fallback functionality ensures continuity in mining activities even if a pool decides to censor transactions, thereby incentivizing pools to prioritize miners' interests. This new version is the culmination of enhancements in the Stratum V2 specification achieved through collaboration within the working group and rigorous testing with the interoperability suite to ensure seamless compatibility between implementations of the Stratum V2 protocol. The release allows miners using SV1 or SV2 firmware to connect directly to an SV2 Pool or through a translation proxy. Miners can construct their block templates using a locally hosted Job Declaration Client and a patched version of Bitcoin Core Node, enabling them to send their templates to the Job Declarator Server operated by the SV2 Pool. Importantly, this update also allows independent third parties to run the node and JDC, expanding operational capabilities. The newly implemented pool fallback feature ensures miners maintain mining activity by automatically switching to alternative pools in the event a pool rejects their templates. This mechanism serves as a strong incentive for pools to act in the miners' best interests, ensuring miners' hash power remains secure and competitive. SRI's user-friendly pool setup and upcoming enhancements make it an attractive option for miners and pools seeking streamlined mining experiences. The project says it welcomes contributions and support from individuals and corporate entities interested in providing grants to help accelerate the development, research, and innovation in bitcoin mining technology.","article_summary":"SRI 1.0.0 is officially here, bringing significant upgrades in enhancing and decentralizing Bitcoin mining operations.","guid":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/stratum-reference-implementation-launches-sri-1-0-0-to-enhance-bitcoin-mining","creation_date":"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 22:17:35 GMT","associated_tags":["Bitcoin mining","SRI","Business","Stratum Reference Implementation","News"],"article_link":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/stratum-reference-implementation-launches-sri-1-0-0-to-enhance-bitcoin-mining","website_source":"bitcoinmagazine"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin's Surge to All Time High: What It Means for Your Investment Future","article_type":"article","author":{"name":"Miles Oliver"},"article_detailed_content":"Bitcoin, the first and most popular cryptocurrency, has been making headlines with its recent surge to a new all-time high of over $72,000. This remarkable price increase has sparked renewed interest in Bitcoin as an investment opportunity, leaving many wondering what this means for their financial future. Investors may see this surge as a validation of Bitcoin's potential as a long-term store of value and may allocate more of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. However, the rapid rise in price may also raise concerns about potential volatility and the sustainability of such gains, prompting investors to carefully evaluate the risks before making investment decisions. Understanding Market Dynamics and Risks While Bitcoin has grown significantly over the years due to various factors, including rising institutional adoption, increased investor interest, and greater acceptance by traditional financial organizations, it's still seen as a highly volatile asset. This level of vulnerability which can be affected by supply and demand, government regulation, and sensationalism, is not exclusive to Bitcoin. It\u2019s also evident in traditional investment avenues. Investors should understand the financial markets and take a well-considered approach to investing. No stock investment is a sure thing, and Bitcoin is no exception. However, with the right strategies, investors can capitalize on Bitcoin's potential for high returns while mitigating the risks associated with this market. Strategies for Incorporating Bitcoin into Wealth Preservation Despite the unpredictability of Bitcoin stock, many are attracted to it since it acts as a hedge against inflation. With traditional currencies, governments can print more money, leading to a loss in purchasing power. However, Bitcoin's finite supply makes it immune to inflation, contrasting with traditional currencies where governments can print more money, leading many to view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Here are some strategies for incorporating Bitcoin into your financial security: Diversify Your Investments Investors should diversify their portfolios and allocate a portion to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This will help mitigate risk and capitalize on Bitcoin's potential high returns. Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tied to a stable asset like the US dollar, can be used as a buffer for Bitcoin's volatility. Take Calculated Risks To safeguard and increase wealth effectively, investors must be willing to take calculated risks for sustained growth and long-term profitability. These can include strategic savings, investing in a mix of asset classes, and incorporating Bitcoin into asset protection efforts. They must also be aware of scammers seeking to exploit the growing interest in cryptocurrencies and take measures to safeguard their investments against fraudulent schemes. Educate Yourself Before making any financial decisions, it is important to educate yourself on the market. This is especially true for Bitcoin, given its unique characteristics. Take the time to research the technology behind this cryptocurrency, its market trends, and its potential impact on traditional financial systems. Given its resilience, portability, and divisibility, it's also wise to explore Bitcoin's value compared to gold, stocks, and other conventional investments, to make an educated decision that can help increase your monetary gains. Regulate Your Emotions It's essential to keep emotions in check and stick to a well-considered investment plan. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on market variations or FOMO (fear of missing out). This will help ensure a more rational and stable approach to incorporating Bitcoin into your wealth management strategy. The key is approaching Bitcoin as a long-term investment rather than trying to time the market. Use Dollar-Cost Averaging Dollar-cost averaging is a tactic where you invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of market fluctuations. This can aid in smoothing out the effects of market instability and potentially reduce vulnerabilities. The beauty of this approach is that it can be applied to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, making it an effective way to incorporate them into your portfolio. Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting Tax-loss harvesting is a technique where investors sell investments at a loss to compensate for any capital gains, resulting in lower taxes. Given Bitcoin's volatility, this strategy can be advantageous when incorporated into your portfolio. However, be mindful of the IRS guidelines and consult with a tax professional for guidance to prevent any legal issues. Stick to a Long-Term Plan Getting caught up in the hype and making short-term decisions based on Bitcoin's price fluctuations can be appealing. However, to effectively include Bitcoin in your financial portfolio, it's vital to stick to a long-term financial plan. This will help prevent emotional reactions to market changes and allow for a more strategic approach. Future Projections for Bitcoin Many experts believe Bitcoin's surge to over $72,000 is just the beginning of its potential growth. One projection by the CEO of Ark Invest estimates a future price range of over $1 million per Bitcoin by 2030. While no one can predict the exact trend of Bitcoin's value, it's clear that this cryptocurrency has established itself as a viable and valuable asset class. Bitcoin's recent surge further solidifies its position as a legitimate investment option. With growing institutional acceptance and continued interest from investors, it's likely to see even more significant growth in the future. Understanding the risks and having a well-considered approach to incorporating Bitcoin into wealth preservation efforts can help investors capitalize on this potential. As with any investment, thorough research and careful consideration are crucial to making informed decisions and maximizing returns. Monitor Bitcoin's future developments and consider including it in your investment strategy for long-term financial growth and stability. This is a guest post by Miles O.

Dubbed \"crypto winter,\" the unforgiving market crushed the hopes of many traders, startup founders, and investors. Marked by scandals, regulatory uncertainty, and lots of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt in crypto parlance), crypto winter brought down some of the industry's most significant projects and companies. However, the US SEC\u2019s successive approvals of eleven spot BTC ETF applications on January 10, 2024, changed all perspectives, turning many bullish. It\u2019s not just institutions that are optimistic about the development. Even smaller retail traders are excited about the new ETFs. If you are a retail trader sharing your strategies and showcasing a public crypto portfolio for your audience, the rising interest in Bitcoin will likely increase your following and boost your profitability. New ETF Products Introduced Wall Street came on strong, with the world's most prominent asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, Valkyrie, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, ArkInvest/21 Shares, Grayscale, Bitwise, Invesco/Galaxy, and WisdomTree launching their Bitcoin ETFs with aggressive fanfare. The multi-billion- and trillion-dollar institutions promoted and competed Bitcoin-based products in the open market for the first time. The resulting billions of dollars in inflows broke ETF records and were a massive, unexpected win for Bitcoin. Allocations to US spot Bitcoin ETFs overwhelmed hundreds of millions in outflows to incumbent fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), raking in over $2.4 billion in the first week. BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC brought in $1.6 billion and $648 million as they rounded up their first week. In addition, the two trillion-dollar asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity and the other funds offering spot Bitcoin ETFs have started a Bitcoin accumulation race. Bitcoin's price surged at the ETF news, rising past $50,000 for the first time since late 2021. Thus, Bitcoin\u2019s watershed moment appears to have begun. But what does it imply for money, wealth, and investing? What does it mean for cryptocurrency? Will the lines between decentralized assets and traditional products finally blur? Here, we discuss whether the historic approval of Bitcoin ETFs will mark a defining transformation in crypto and finance. How Do Spot Bitcoin ETFs Work? Spot Bitcoin Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) are financial products traded on public exchanges that track the performance of Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin futures, which were approved years ago and have been traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), spot Bitcoin ETFs hold actual Bitcoin through a registered custodian. An ETF buys BTC through authorized crypto exchanges or other Bitcoin holders. The Bitcoin is stored in a secure digital wallet using cold storage. Cold storage means the wallet is offline. In the case of spot ETFs, a designated custodian handles the crypto asset's cold storage and provides additional layers of security. After secure storage is ensured, the ETF issues the corresponding shares. A share corresponds to Bitcoin or a specified unit of Bitcoin and must reflect the prevailing price. Shares are publicly traded on traditional stock exchanges. The ETF shares must follow the price of Bitcoin as closely as possible. ETFs must regularly rebalance their holdings, buying or selling their BTC as needed. A spot ETF's price can depart from the underlying asset's value. To align the fund with the asset's real value and maintain the price, authorized participants (APs) are tasked to intervene. The process of creating and redeeming shares is done by the APs, which are typically large financial institutions. The APs create or redeem shares based on market demand. Should ETF shares trade at a discount or premium, the APs redeem or create the ETF shares in large blocks. These measures arbitrage the difference so the share price aligns with the current Bitcoin price. APs profit from the arbitrage opportunity when the ETF price deviates higher or lower versus the underlying asset\u2019s value. On the investor and trader side, buying a spot Bitcoin ETF is similar to buying regular shares in any security or ETF. Hence, investors can gain exposure to BTC indirectly by buying shares without holding the cryptocurrency. Efficiency and liquidity in the market are maintained by market makers who keep offering to buy or sell shares of the ETF. Market maker activity is critical to Bitcoin ETF stability. They ensure that investors can easily buy or sell the asset whenever necessary. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Game-changer for crypto? Bitcoin and the rest of crypto have come a long way since the early days when there were barely any exchanges to trade them. However, digital assets have struggled to break through to the mainstream because of numerous regulatory challenges that heightened in the past few years. Negative statements from regulators and banks dampened sentiment and caused Bitcoin and the rest of crypto to flounder. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been through a challenging decade-long journey as well. The Winklevoss twins filed the first spot Bitcoin ETF, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, in 2013. It was rejected by the US SEC twice over risk-related concerns in what was once a nascent crypto industry. Several followed since the Winklevoss ETF application, and all were greeted with a dozen rejections on the grounds of inadequate investor protection. The Clayton era of regulation, referring to the period when SEC Chair Jay Clayton was in charge, marked the lowest point for Bitcoin ETFs. In the summer of 2018, the SEC rejected nine Bitcoin ETF applications in a single day. Years later, Bitcoin and crypto scored an unlikely legal win when Grayscale fought the SEC\u2019s rejection of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) application to convert to an ETF. A federal appeals court ruled that the SEC was mistaken in its rejection of Grayscale\u2019s application, noting that the surveillance arrangements on the approved Bitcoin futures ETFs would suffice for spot Bitcoin ETFs. As a result of this landmark win, the Securities and Exchange Commission could no longer use the same argument to reject future Bitcoin ETF applications of a similar nature. Under pressure, the new SEC Chair Gary Gensler issued a formal statement on January 10, 2024, approving the trading of several new spot Bitcoin ETP shares. The unexpectedly triumphant arc of Bitcoin ETFs has ushered in optimism in the market. The approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, whose issuers include the largest asset manager in the US and the world, have potentially opened the floodgates for a new audience of retail investors and institutions\u2014an audience with little or no experience in buying and selling cryptocurrency directly. Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs We\u2019ve had a few weeks to observe the market response to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The approved ETFs have demonstrated tremendous inflows and record-breaking numbers. The \u201cNew Nine\u201d Bitcoin ETFs: Early success The newly approved spot Bitcoin ETFs are popularly called the \"new nine.\" Trading volumes for the new nine ETFs notched a new daily record. As BTC surged to $54,938 on February 26, trading volumes for all nine ETFs topped $2.4 billion. According to data from Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, the total volume on February 26 beat the prior record of $2.2 billion on January 11, the first trading day. These figures exclude the volume from Grayscale\u2019s GBTC, a converted bitcoin ETF product. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT recorded its biggest trading day so far. Nasdaq data showed that over $1.3 billion in IBIT shares were traded, exceeding its previous record of $1 billion when it debuted on January 10. IBIT took the most volume out of all the ETFs. Fidelity\u2019s FBTC placed second with $576 million in inflows. ARK 21 Shares (ARKB) recorded $276 million in inflows, while the Bitwise (BTB) spot Bitcoin ETF tallied $81 million. New institutional interest The exchange-traded funds have dramatically catalyzed new institutional interest in crypto. The US SEC's approval provides a favorable signal for large institutions and market participants waiting for more familiar access to the digital asset class outside of direct buys through crypto exchanges, which carry inherent custody and volatility risks. Photo by lo lo on Unsplash Institutional fund managers could start adding Bitcoin ETFs to their investment funds. Moreover, retirement planners can include them in employer-sponsored 401(k)s. US investors can now hold crypto in their brokerage accounts\u2014something impossible before. Interest among retail investors Where institutions go, retail follows. The assurance of investor protection and the wide acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs will encourage retail to participate. Mass retail now has a relatively safe way to gain exposure to crypto through a regular brokerage account. Bitcoin ETFs will inevitably bring crypto exposure to a more diverse set of holders with varying sizes and experiences in the market. Access to Bitcoin today is as simple as purchasing an ETF from a regulated asset manager. In addition, Bitcoin could start turning up in mainstream portfolios. New credibility and status for crypto The new kind of ETF could increase the distribution in the US and boost the credibility of crypto as an asset class, according to Kevin de Patoul, CEO of Keyrock, a crypto liquidity provider, in an interview with CNBC. The idea of a US spot Bitcoin ETF significantly changes the public perception of Bitcoin. It eliminates doubts about Bitcoin's legitimacy and erases misconceptions about its infamous reputation as a tool to aid crime. This application has been proven to be a minor percentage of its overall use. Hence, the US SEC's approval lent credibility and status primarily through regulatory certainty. Crypto is on its way to becoming a formal asset class, widely traded on any public exchange like other familiar investment vehicles. More crypto ETPs to follow The ability to hold Bitcoin in mainstream portfolios green-lights portfolio diversification into the crypto asset. Many expected significant capital inflows into the market and were satisfied. A spot Ethereum ETF may not be far behind. Valkyrie CIO Steven McClurg expects a spot Ethereum ETF approval within a year or two. If a spot Ethereum ETF is eventually launched, it could mark another boost for the status of crypto assets. ETF effect on BTC and crypto prices The record-breaking response to the bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin's price surge indicates the market's current sentiment. Both have continued to spur bullishness among investors and institutions. The uptick in demand, coupled with diminishing supply, could cause an acceleration in price. As of this writing, BTC rose to above $59,000. Then, there is the question of history repeating itself. Experts point out how the total market cap of gold exploded after the first gold ETF was launched in 2004. Bitcoin, being digital gold, could follow the same path. These days, Bitcoin ETF issuers have been buying approximately 10 to 12 times the amount of BTC produced daily. This has led to a 2 percent price increase or roughly $1,000 daily. Many experts agree that the demand from ETF issuers is the primary reason for the significant daily uptick. An analysis by crypto startup founder, expert, and Bitcoin investor Mark van der Chijs found that the price jumps occurred around the settlement period before the opening of the US market. The exponential nature of the demand has been pressing holders to sell their holdings to fill the ETF orders. These sales command higher prices as the current holders or users do not believe BTC is peaking. The higher prices trigger FOMO (fear of missing out) among traders and ETF investors. The FOMO leads to higher demand, triggering a further increase in prices. Many experts agree this market is uncharted territory. However, Van der Chijs is sticking to his prediction of $1,000 increases on average per trading day over the coming weeks. Incoming supply shock? At least two factors could contribute to a drastic increase in price and Bitcoin supply shock over the next three months: continued high demand for ETF shares and the Bitcoin halving event in April. After the upcoming halving, miners' block rewards will be cut in half. As a result, the rate of BTC daily production will decrease. At the moment, approximately 900 BTC is being created daily. After the halving event, this number will drop to 450 BTC. This will further dwindle the supply and lead to a discrepancy in supply and demand. The production slash could lead to higher BTC prices as investors of all levels and ETF issuers scramble to increase holdings. There is a risk of ETFs failing too soon. Most financial advisors, therefore, allow the sale of shares 90 days past launch or after 90 days of trading. As the ETFs started trading on January 11, the 90-day period should commence by early May, further pushing BTC\u2019s price upward. It is possible to have a black swan event, seeing BTC break its previous record of $69,000 and achieve a new all-time high before the halving. Chijs predicts $100,000 BTC in the coming two to three months. Impact on the broader financial ecosystem Some have noted that big banks were notably absent during the ETF action. Banks can participate in the ETF ecosystem but need the US SEC to redefine crypto assets. In a stunning move, a trade group coalition making up the Banking Policy Institute asked the SEC to modify the rules around crypto asset custody, allowing them to act as custodians, as is the regular practice for most ETPs. Bitcoin proponents would not have imagined such interest back in the day, but here we are. Increased competition: Fee wars Despite significant Grayscale-related outflows in the first few days, ETFs stabilized to massive net-positive inflows. Expect competition among Bitcoin ETFs for features and fees. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the most expensive\u2014offering 1.5 percent in fees. Bitwise opts not to charge fees for the first six months and then caps them at 0.2 percent afterward. A New Era Merging Wall Street, Crypto, and Main Street The triumphant launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs broke all expectations and models. Early on, ETF issuers were able to bridge Wall Street, crypto, and Main Street by creating a familiar and easily accessible investment product. The early success of ETFs has numerous implications for the status of digital assets, the demand around Bitcoin, the dynamism of crypto trading, the total crypto market cap, and how people build mainstream portfolios from now on. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a crucial milestone in the maturity of Bitcoin and crypto as an asset class. They officially begin significant institutional involvement with trillion-dollar players competing for dominance. Demand is expected to increase as the funds accumulate Bitcoin at rates exceeding daily production. Despite the promising data and optimistic projections, we remain in uncharted territory. Corrections are inevitable, and black swan events could happen. Wall Street has brought crypto to Main Street, but this development's full impact and transformation are still unfolding.

The rationale is understandable: if criminals won\u2019t be able to use their money, they will have to eventually stop whatever they are doing and go get a 9 to 5 job. However, after 20 years of ever tighter (and ever more expensive) AML regulations, the levels of organized crime, tax evasion, or drug use do not show any signs of decrease. At the same time, the basic right to privacy is being unceremoniously violated on an everyday basis, with each financial operation, no matter how tiny, being subject to extensive verifications and tons of paperwork. Check Part 1 of this story for details and numbers. This prompts a question: should we reconsider our approach to the AML strategy? Two years ago, a fintech author David G.W. Birch wrote an article for Forbes, reflecting on the main principle of AML \u2013 gatekeeping. The key thought could be resumed as \u201cinstead of trying to prevent criminals from getting into the system, we let them in and monitor what they are up to.\u201d Indeed, why do we erect expensive AML gates and force the bad guys to turn to hardly traceable cash or works of art, while we can simply let them in and follow the money to hunt them down? To do so, we can use both the existing reporting system within traditional finance and the on-chain analytics within the blockchain. However, while the former is more or less understandable, the latter is still a mystery for most people. What\u2019s more, politicians and bankers regularly accuse crypto of being a tool for criminals, tax evaders, and all sorts of Satan worshipers, further exacerbating the misunderstanding. To shed more light on this matter, we need to better understand how on-chain analytics works. It is not an obvious task though: blockchain analysis methods are often proprietary and analytics companies sharing them could risk losing their business edge. However, some of them, like Chainalysis, publish rather detailed documentation, while the Luxembourgish firm Scorechain agreed to share some details of their trade for this story. Combining this data can give us a good idea of the potential and limitations of on-chain analytics. How does on-chain analytics work? The blockchain is transparent and auditable by anyone. However, not everyone is capable of drawing meaningful conclusions from the myriads of datasets it is composed of. Gathering data, identifying the entities, and putting the conclusions into a readable format is the specialty of on-chain analytic firms. It all starts with getting a copy of the ledger, i.e. synchronizing the internal software with the blockchains. Then, a tedious stage of mapping begins. How can we know that this address belongs to an exchange, and this one \u2013 to a darknet marketplace? Analysts employ all their creativity and resourcefulness to try and de-pseudonymize the blockchain as much as they can. Any technique is good as long as it works: collecting open-source data from law enforcement, scraping websites, navigating Twitter-X and other social media, acquiring data from specialized blockchain explorers like Etherscan, following the trace of stolen funds upon requests from attorneys\u2026 Some services are identified by interacting with them, i.e. sending funds to centralized exchanges to identify their addresses. To reduce the errors, the data is often cross-checked with different sources. Once the addresses are identified to the best of one\u2019s ability, one can see a bit clearer in the maze of transaction hashes. Yet, the picture is still far from complete. If for account-based blockchains like Ethereum identifying an address allows tracking its funds in a rather straightforward manner, for UTXO blockchains like Bitcoin, the situation is much less obvious. Indeed, unlike Ethereum, which keeps track of addresses, Bitcoin blockchain keeps track of the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO). Each transaction always sends all the coins associated with an address. If a person wishes to spend only a part of their coins, the unspent part, also known as change, is assigned to a newly created address controlled by the sender. It is the job of on-chain analytics firms to make sense of these movements and determine clusters of UTXO associated with the same entity. Can on-chain analytics be trusted? On-chain analytics is not an exact science. Both the mapping and the clustering of UTXO rely on experience and a carefully calibrated set of heuristics each company has developed for itself. This issue was highlighted last July in the court hearing involving Chainalysis, which had provided its forensic expertise in the US v Sterlingov case. The firm\u2019s representative admitted that not only its methods were not peer-reviewed or otherwise scientifically validated, but also the firm did not keep track of its false positives. In Chainalysis defense, the first point is understandable: the methods that each firm uses to analyze the blockchain are closely guarded trade secrets. However, the issue of false positives must be tackled better, especially if it could end up sending someone to jail. Scorechain uses a different approach, erring on the side of caution and only choosing the methods that do not generate false positives in the clustering process, such as the multi-input heuristics (assumption that in a single transaction all input addresses come from one entity). Unlike Chainalysis, they do not use any change heuristics, which produce a lot of false positives. In some cases, their team can manually track UTXOs if a human operator has enough reasons to do so, but overall, this approach tolerates blind spots, counting on the additional information in the future that would fill them in. The very notion of heuristics \u2013 i.e. strategies that employ a practical but not necessarily scientifically proven approach to problem-solving \u2013 implies that it cannot guarantee 100% reliability. It is the outcome that measures its effectiveness. The FBI stating that Chainalysis\u2019 methods are \u201cgenerally reliable\u201d could serve as proof of quality, but it would be better if all on-chain analytics firms could start measuring and sharing their rates of false positives and false negatives. Seeing through the fog There are ways of obfuscating the trace of funds or making them more difficult to find. Crypto hackers and scammers are known to use all kinds of techniques: chain hopping, privacy blockchains, mixers\u2026 Some of them, like swapping or bridging assets, can be traced by on-chain analytics firms. Others, like the privacy chain Monero, or various mixers and tumblers, often can\u2019t. There were, however, instances when Chainalysis claimed to de-mix transactions passed through a mixer, and most recently Finnish authorities announced that they have tracked Monero transactions as part of an investigation. In any case, the very fact of having used these masking techniques is very much visible and can serve as a red flag for any AML purposes. The US Treasury adding last year the smart contract address of Tornado Cash mixer to the OFAC list is one such example. Now, when the coins\u2019 history is traced down to this mixer, the funds are suspected of belonging to illicit actors. This is not great news for privacy advocates, but rather reassuring for crypto AML. One might ask what\u2019s the point of flagging the mixed coins and tracing them across blockchains if we don\u2019t have a concrete person to pin them to, like in the banking system? Luckily, criminals have to interact with the non-criminal world, and the tainted money sooner or later ends up either at goods or service providers, or at a bank account, and this is where law enforcement can identify the actual persons. This is how the FBI got its biggest-ever seizure of $4.5 billion worth of Bitcoin (in 2022 prices) following the Bitfinex hack. This also works in reverse: if law enforcement gets access to a criminal\u2019s private keys, they can move up the blockchain history to identify the addresses that had interacted with it at some point. This is how the London Metropolitan Police uncovered a whole drug dealing network from one single arrest (source: Chainalysis\u2019 Crypto Crime 2023 report). Crime has existed since the dawn of humanity, and will probably accompany it till its end, using ever-evolving camouflaging techniques. Luckily, crime detection methods follow suit, and it happens that the blockchain is an ideal environment for deploying digital forensics tools. After all, it is transparent and accessible to everyone (which by the way cannot be said about the banking sector). One can argue that current on-chain analysis methods need to be improved \u2013 and that point holds true. However, it is clear that even in this imperfect form it is already an efficient tool for tracking bad guys on-chain. Perhaps, then, it\u2019s time to reconsider our approach to AML and let the criminals into the blockchain? A special thank you to the Scorechain team for sharing their knowledge.

Speaking at the 2024 Abundance360 Summit this week, Saylor revealed how he offered to buy out MicroStrategy shareholders in a Dutch action when they moved to first acquire $250 million worth of Bitcoin. The comments come after Saylor and his company announced earlier this week that they had purchased approximately 9,245 bitcoins for around $623 million. This latest acquisition brings MicroStrategy's total holdings to about 214,246 BTC. In a video clip from the conference, Saylor explained how he offered MicroStrategy shareholders the option to tender their shares back to the company as they were buying Bitcoin. \"We announced that we would do a Dutch auction and buy back $250 million of the stock at a premium. The stock was about $121-$122. We offered to buy our shareholders out at $140. We gave 20 days to think about it.\" Saylor explained. He said his philosophy was to \"buy Bitcoin\" and that he was willing to do whatever it took to accumulate more. At the time, the Bitcoin was price was roughly $11,000, down from all-time highs at $20,000 set in 2017. Saylor's aggressiveness in acquiring Bitcoin for MicroStrategy has made the enterprise software company one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. The company currently holds over $13.7 billion worth of BTC, making Bitcoin its primary corporate treasury asset.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. As we get closer and closer to the impending Bitcoin halving, the combined pressures of wildly increasing demand and shrinking supply have created an unusual market, turning a historically positive omen into an explosive opportunity for profit. The Bitcoin ETF approval has changed the face of Bitcoin as we know it. Since the SEC made its fateful decision in January, the resultant developments have caused worldwide upheaval; billions have flown into these new investment opportunities, and regulators in many countries are considering the role of Bitcoin in the financial establishment. Despite some initial setbacks, the market has comfortably hit new all-time highs, and the price has stayed in a very impressive range even despite fluctuations. Nevertheless, we are in a very unique situation that can impact the market in unpredictable ways. Bitcoin\u2019s next halving is set to arrive in April, and this will be the first time in its entire history that the halving will coincide with an all-time high for price. Although there have been a great deal of differences between each of the major halvings, a trend has been generally noticeable: even if there are huge steady gains, it is in the ballpark of a year to 18 months before Bitcoin breaks all records with a true price spike. One year out from the halving in June 2016, Bitcoin had more than doubled; yet a few months later, the growth was closer to 30x. Source There is plenty of optimism from substantial industry players, such as Standard Chartered\u2019s bold prediction that Bitcoin\u2019s value will more than double to $150k before the year is over. However, their analysis of the situation is not mostly based on halving trends but on the rampaging success of the Bitcoin ETF, and that success has also thrown us a curveball. As community discussion has been quick to point out, these major ETF issuers have been pouring billions into bitcoin, buying at astounding rates and amassing some of the world\u2019s largest Bitcoin supplies practically overnight. If they collectively purchase more than even the worldwide community, how will they react when the spigot of new coins shuts to a trickle? In other words, we are headed into a situation where demand is at an all-time high and there is insufficient supply to meet it. Business Insider called the upcoming halving a \u201cmomentous event\u201d, considering that the ETF had made \u201cpermanent changes to Bitcoin\u2019s underlying infrastructure.\" Coinshares echoed these sentiments with the warning of a positive demand shock, as Head of Research James Butterfill claimed that \u201cThe launch of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs on January 11 has led to an average daily demand of 4500 bitcoins (trading days only), while only an average of 921 new bitcoin were minted per day.\u201d And that\u2019s only considering the pre-halving mining rates. The ETF issuers are already relying on secondhand Bitcoin sales to fill up their coffers, and this trend seems certain to increase in the immediate future. Isn\u2019t this a good thing, though? Positive demand shocks, as a rule, are generally associated with jumps in price. Additionally, even though shocks like this in critical commodities like oil can lead to inflation, Bitcoin is not yet an essential component of the entire world economy. It\u2019s unlikely that the same drawbacks will apply just yet. In other words, the answer is generally yes, but the situation can still cause alarming trends. For example, the night of March 18 saw a truly bewildering development: coasting at highs around $70k, Bitcoin\u2019s value on BitMEX crashed below $9k in the blink of an eye. The price recovered quickly and was, in any event, isolated to this one exchange, but it\u2019s still an unprecedented development. Source BitMEX announced that the culprit of this negative price spike was a series of large sell orders in the middle of the night, and that they were investigating the activity. Several anonymous whales in particular have emerged as the likely candidates for these sales. We still have no idea who exactly they are or who was buying bitcoins at such a prodigious rate, but it\u2019s only an example of how major selloffs can torpedo market confidence. In any event, this one episode is only a particularly sharp example of a general trend; \u201cconstant\u201d spot selling as Bitcoin\u2019s price receives a bloody nose. The market hit lows of $62k Tuesday afternoon, while it was nearly at $72k on the morning of the previous Friday. Traders have nevertheless remained totally optimistic that these price dips are nothing more than the \u201cbear trap\u201d associated with the pre-halving environment, and they aren\u2019t the only ones. Prominent executives including Binance CEO Richard Teng and Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek have endorsed the viewpoint that these kinds of price dips are a perfectly natural and temporary component of a scheduled halving. There is a clearly observable trend of substantial price dips, from 20-40%, in the weeks immediately prior to the most recent halvings. And yet, the price bounced back quickly and completely, and went on to new all-time heights. Source In other words, some of the recent and sudden price dives are fully explainable using data from Bitcoin\u2019s history. The relevant questions for us, then, are whether Bitcoin\u2019s future will follow the same line. The fact of the matter is that all the available signs point to an optimistic long-term forecast. A positive demand shock caused by ETF acquisitions and the halving may very well make it more difficult for an average consumer to buy bitcoin, but how will that difficulty manifest? Higher prices. Besides, a selling point of the ETF is that plenty of average consumers will use it to seek exposure to bitcoin\u2019s profits, rather than direct custody. This alone will encourage ETF issuers to keep their buying pressure high. It\u2019s impossible to say how long this market situation will continue or what it will mean for bitcoin\u2019s use as an actual currency, but there\u2019s nothing in the current situation to suggest that bitcoin won\u2019t keep growing. Is it any wonder, then, that the community is gearing up to welcome the halving with such bated breath? Prominent industry figures are taking great care to prepare \u201cThe Biggest Celebration in Bitcoin\u201d with live coverage and meetup events in 7 countries (and counting), and the halving isn\u2019t even expected for another month. It\u2019s very possible that 2024 will be remembered as the year that Bitcoin truly became enmeshed in the global financial infrastructure, if stunning regulatory victories in January turn to unprecedented growth by December. Really, the major significant concern is whether or not Bitcoin will see diminished usage as a currency when its worth in fiat is so valuable. Nevertheless, the signs from right now seem quite clear: Bitcoin is set to blaze a trail into the future.","article_summary":"The Bitcoin halving is coming, and past trends all point to greater prosperity.

In the smartphone era, unless extreme precautions are taken, everywhere you go, everything you say, and everything you consume is quantifiable among the infinite spectrum of the information goods markets. Information goods, being inherently nonphysical bits of data, can be conceptualized, crafted, produced, or manufactured, disseminated, and consumed exclusively as digital entities. The internet, along with other digital technologies for computation and communication, serves as a comprehensive e-commerce infrastructure, facilitating the entire life cycle of designing, producing, distributing, and consuming a wide array of information goods. The seamless transition of existing information goods from traditional formats to digital formats is easily achievable, not to mention the collection of media formats completely infeasible in the analog world. A preliminary examination of products within the information goods industry reveals that, while they all exist as pure information products and are uniformly impacted by technological advancements, their respective markets undergo distinct economic transformation processes. These variations in market evolution are inherently tied to differences in product characteristics, production methods, distribution channels, and consumption patterns. Notably, the separation of value creation and revenue processes introduces opportunistic scenarios, potentially leaving established market players with unprofitable customer bases and costly yet diminishing value-creation processes. Simultaneously, novel organizational architectures may emerge in response to evolving technological conditions, effectively creating and destroying traditional information good markets overnight. The value chains, originally conceived under the assumptions of the traditional information goods economy, undergo radical redesigns as new strategies and tooling materialize in response to the transformative influence of digital production, distribution, and consumption on conventional value propositions for data. For example, mass surveillance was never practical when creating even a single photo meant hours of labor within a specialized photo development room with specific chemical and lightning conditions. Now that there is a camera on every corner, a microphone in every pocket, a ledger entry for every financial transaction, and the means to transmit said data essentially for free across the planet, the market conditions for mass surveillance have unsurprisingly given rise to mass surveillance as a service. An entirely new industry of \u201clocation firms\u201d has grown, with The Markup having demarcated nearly 50 companies selling location data as a service in a 2021 article titled \u201cThere\u2019s a Multibillion-Dollar Market for Your Phone\u2019s Location Data\u201d by Keegan and Ng. One such firm, Near, is self-described as curating \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest sources of intelligence on People and Places\u201d, having gathered data representing nearly two billion people across 44 countries. According to a Grand View Research report titled \u201cLocation Intelligence Market Size And Share Report, 2030\u201d, the global location intelligence data market cap was worth an estimated \u201c$16.09 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.6% from 2023 to 2030\u201d. The market cap of this new information goods industry is mainly \u201cdriven by the growing penetration of smart devices and increasing investments in IoT [internet of things] and network services as it facilitates smarter applications and better network connectivity\u201d, giving credence to the idea that technological advancement front-runs network growth which front-runs entirely new forms of e-commerce markets. This, of course, was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, in which government policies resulted in \u201cthe increased adoption of location intelligence solutions to manage the changing business scenario as it helps businesses to analyze, map, and share data in terms of the location of their customers\u201d, under the guise of user and societal health. Within any information goods market, there are only two possible outcomes for market participants: distributing the acquired data or keeping it for yourself. Click the image above to subscribe! The Modern Information Goods Market In the fall of 2021, China launched the Shanghai Data Exchange (SDE) in an attempt to create a state-owned monopoly on a novel speculative commodities market for data scraped from one of the most digitally surveilled populations on the planet. The SDE offered 20 data products at launch, including customer flight information from China Eastern Airlines, as well as data from telecommunications network operators such as China Unicom, China Telecom, and China Mobile. Notably, one of the first known trades made at the SDE was the Commercial Bank of China purchasing data from the state-owned Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company under the guise of improving their financial services and product offerings. Shortly before the founding of this data exchange, Huang Qifan, the former mayor of Chongqing, was quoted saying that \u201cthe state should monopolize the rights to regulate data and run data exchanges\u201d, while also suggesting that the CCP should be highly selective in setting up data exchanges. \u201cLike stock exchanges, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen can have one, but a general provincial capital city or a municipal city should not have it.\u201d While the current information goods market has led to such innovations such as speculation on the purchasing of troves of user data, the modern data market was started in earnest at the end of the 1970s, exemplified in the formation of Oracle Corporation in 1977, named after the CIA\u2019s \u201cProject Oracle\u201d, which featured eventual Oracle Corporation co-founders Larry Ellison, Robert Miner, and Ed Oates. The CIA was their first customer, and in 2002, nearly $2.5 billion worth of contracts came from selling software to federal, state, and local governments, accounting for nearly a quarter of their total revenue. Only a few months after September 11, 2001, Ellison penned an op-ed for The New York Times titled \u201cA Single National Security Database\u201d in which the opening paragraph reads \u201cThe single greatest step we Americans could take to make life tougher for terrorists would be to ensure that all the information in myriad government databases was copied into a single, comprehensive national security database\u201d. Ellison was quoted in Jeffrey Rosen\u2019s book The Naked Crowd as saying \u201cThe Oracle database is used to keep track of basically everything. The information about your banks, your checking balance, your savings balance, is stored in an Oracle database. Your airline reservation is stored in an Oracle database. What books you bought on Amazon is stored in an Oracle database. Your profile on Yahoo! is stored in an Oracle database\u201d. Rosen made note of a discussion with David Carney, a former top-three employee at the CIA, who, after 32 years of service at the agency, left to join Oracle just two months after 9/11 to lead its Information Assurance Center: \"How do you say this without sounding callous?\" [Carney] asked. \"In some ways, 9/11 made business a bit easier. Previous to 9/11 you pretty much had to hype the threat and the problem.\" Carney said that the summer before the attacks, leaders in the public and private sectors wouldn't sit still for a briefing. Then his face brightened. \"Now they clamor for it!\" This relationship has continued for 20 years, and in November 2022, the CIA awarded its Commercial Cloud Enterprise contract to five American companies \u2014 Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Oracle. While the CIA did not disclose the exact value of the contract, documents released in 2019 suggested it could be \u201ctens of billions\u201d of dollars over the next 15 years. Unfortunately, this is far from the only data market integration of the private sector, government agencies, and the intelligence community, perhaps best exemplified by data broker LexisNexis. LexisNexis was founded in 1970, and is, as of 2006, the world\u2019s largest electronic database for legal and public-records-related information. According to their own website, LexisNexis describes themselves as delivering \u201ca comprehensive suite of solutions to arm government agencies with superior data, technology and analytics to support mission success\u201d. LexisNexis consists of nine board members: CEO Haywood Talcove; Dr. Richard Tubb, the longest serving White House physician in U.S. history; Stacia Hylton, former Deputy Director of the U.S. Marshal Service; Brian Stafford, former Director of the U.S. Secret Service; Lee Rivas, CEO for the public sector and health care business units of LexisNexis Risk Solutions; Howard Safir, former NYPD Commissioner and Associate Director of Operations for the U.S. Marshals Service; Floyd Clarke, former Director of the FBI; Henry Udow, Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary for the RELX Group; and lastly Alan Wade, retired Chief Information Officer for the CIA. While Wade was still employed by the CIA, he founded Chiliad with Christine Maxwell, sister of Ghislaine Maxwell, and daughter of Robert Maxwell. Christine Maxwell is considered \u201can early internet pioneer\u201d, having founded Magellan in 1993, one of the premier search engines on the internet. After selling Magellan to Excite, she reinvested her substantial windfall into another big data search technology company: the aforementioned Chiliad. According to a 2020 report by OYE.NEWS, Chiliad made use of \u201con-demand, massively scalable, intelligent mining of structured and unstructured data through the use of natural language search technologies\u201d, with the firm\u2019s proprietary software being \u201cbehind the data search technology used by the FBI\u2019s counterterrorism data warehouse\u201d. As recently as November 2023, the Wade-connected LexisNexis was given a $16-million, five-year contract with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection \u201cfor access to a powerful suite of surveillance tools\u201d, according to available public records, providing access to \u201csocial media monitoring, web data such as email addresses and IP address locations, real-time jail booking data, facial recognition services, and cell phone geolocation data analysis tools\u201d. Unfortunately, this is far from the only government agency to utilize LexisNexis\u2019 data brokerage with the aims of circumnavigating constitutional law and civil liberties in regards to surveillance. In the fall of 2020, LexisNexis was forced to settle for over $5 million after a class action lawsuit alleged the broker sold Department of Motor Vehicle data to U.S. law firms, who were then free to use it for their own business purposes. \"Defendants websites allow the purchase of crash reports by report date, location, or driver name and payment by credit card, prepaid bulk accounts or monthly accounts\u201d, the complaint reads. \"Purchasers are not required to establish any permissible use provided in the DPPA to obtain access to Plaintiffs' and Class Members' MVRs\u201d. In the summer of 2022, a Freedom of Information Act request revealed a $22 million contract between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and LexisNexis. Sejal Zota, a director at Just Futures Law and a practicing attorney working on the lawsuit, made note that LexisNexis makes it possible for ICE to \"instantly access sensitive personal data \u2014 all without warrants, subpoenas, any privacy safeguards or any show of reasonableness\u201d. In the aforementioned complaint from 2022, the use of LexisNexis\u2019 Accurint product allows \"law enforcement officers [to] surveil and track people based on information these officers would not, in many cases, otherwise be able to obtain without a subpoena, court order, or other legal process\u2026enabling a massive surveillance state with files on almost every adult U.S. consumer\u201d. A Series Of Tubes In 2013, it came to the public\u2019s attention that the National Security Agency had covertly breached the primary communication links connecting Yahoo and Google data centers worldwide. This information was based on documents published by WikiLeaks, originally obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and corroborated by interviews of government officials. As per a classified report dated January 9, 2013, the NSA transmits millions of records daily from internal Yahoo and Google networks to data repositories at the agency's Fort Meade, Maryland headquarters. In the preceding month, field collectors processed and returned 181,280,466 new records, encompassing \"metadata\" revealing details about the senders and recipients of emails, along with time stamps, as well as the actual content, including text, audio, and video data. The primary tool employed by the NSA to exploit these data links is a project named MUSCULAR, carried out in collaboration with the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Operating from undisclosed interception points, the NSA and GCHQ copy entire data streams through fiber-optic cables connecting the data centers of major Silicon Valley corporations. This becomes particularly perplexing when considering that, as revealed by a classified document acquired by The Washington Post in 2013, both the NSA and the FBI were already actively tapping into the central servers of nine prominent U.S. internet companies. This covert operation involved extracting audio and video chats, photographs, emails, documents, and connection logs, providing analysts with the means to monitor foreign targets. The method of extraction, as outlined in the document, involves direct collection from the servers of major U.S. service providers: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple. During the same period, the newspaper The Guardian reported that GCHQ \u2014 the British counterpart to the NSA \u2014 was clandestinely gathering intelligence from these internet companies through a collaborative effort with the NSA. According to documents obtained by The Guardian, the PRISM program seemingly allows GCHQ to bypass the formal legal procedures required in Britain to request personal materials such as emails, photos, and videos, from internet companies based outside the country. PRISM emerged in 2007 as a successor to President George W. Bush's secret program of warrantless domestic surveillance, following revelations from the news media, lawsuits, and interventions by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Congress responded with the Protect America Act in 2007 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, providing legal immunity to private companies cooperating voluntarily with U.S. intelligence collection. Microsoft became PRISM's inaugural partner, marking the beginning of years of extensive data collection beneath the surface of a heated national discourse on surveillance and privacy. In a June 2013 statement, then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said \u201cinformation collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats. The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans\u201d. So why the need for collection directly from fiber optic cables if these private companies themselves are already providing data to the national intelligence community? Upon further inquiry into the aforementioned data brokers to the NSA and CIA, it would appear that a vast majority of the new submarine fiber optic cables \u2014 essential infrastructure to the actualization of the internet as a global data market \u2014 are being built out by these same private companies. These inconspicuous cables weave across the global ocean floor, transporting 95-99% of international data through bundles of fiber-optic strands scarcely thicker than a standard garden hose. In total, the active network comprises over 1,100,000 kilometers of submarine cables. Traditionally, these cables have been owned by a consortium of private companies, primarily telecom providers. However, a notable shift has emerged. In 2016, a significant surge in submarine cable development began, and notably, this time, the purchasers are content providers \u2014 particularly the data brokers Meta/Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Of note is Google, having acquired over 100,000 kilometers of submarine cables. With the completion of the Curie Cable in 2019, Google's ownership of submarine cables globally stands at 1.4%, as measured by length. When factoring in cables with shared ownership, Google's overall share increases to approximately 8.5%. Facebook is shortly behind with 92,000 kilometers, with Amazon at 30,000, and Microsoft with around 6,500 kilometers from the partially owned MAREA cable. There is a notable revival in the undersea cable sector, primarily fueled by investments from Facebook and Google, accounting for around 80% of 2018-2020 investments in transatlantic connections \u2014 a significant increase from the less than 20% they accounted for in the preceding three years through 2017, as reported by TeleGeography. This wave of digital giants has fundamentally transformed the dynamics of the industry. Unlike traditional practices where phone companies established dedicated ventures for cable construction, often connecting England to the U.S. for voice calls and limited data traffic, these internet companies now wield considerable influence. They can dictate the cable landing locations, strategically placing them near their data centers, and have the flexibility to modify the line structures \u2014 typically costing around $200 million for a transatlantic link \u2014 without waiting for partner approvals. These technology behemoths aim to capitalize on the increasing demand for rapid data transfers essential for various applications, including streaming movies, social messaging, and even telemedicine. The last time we saw such an explosion of activity in building out essential internet infrastructure was during the dot-com boom of the 1990s, in which phone companies spent over $20 billion to install fiber-optic lines beneath the oceans, immediately before the massive proliferation of personal computers, home internet modems, and peer-to-peer data networks. Data Laundering The birthing of new compression technologies in the form of digital media formats itself would not have given rise to the panopticon we currently operate under without the ability to obfuscate mass uploading and downloading of this newly created data via the ISP rails of both public and private sector infrastructure companies. There is likely no accident that the creation of these tools, networks, and algorithms were created under the influence of national intelligence agencies right before the turn of the millennium, the rise of broadband internet, and the sweeping unconstitutional spying on citizens made legal via the Patriot Act in the aftermath of the events on September 11, 2001. Only 15 years old, Sean Parker, the eventual founder of Napster and first president of Facebook \u2014 a former DARPA project titled LifeLog \u2014 caught the gaze of the FBI for his hacking exploits, ending in state-appointed community service. One year later, Parker was recruited by the CIA after winning a Virginia state computer science fair by developing an early internet crawling application. Instead of continuing his studies, he interned for a D.C. startup, FreeLoader, and eventually UUNet, an internet service provider. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to school,\u201d Parker told Forbes. \u201cI was technically in a co-op program but in truth was just going to work.\u201d Parker made nearly six figures his senior year of high school, eventually starting the peer-to-peer music-sharing site that became Napster in 1999. While working on Napster, Parker met investor Ron Conway, who has backed every Parker product since, having also previously backed PayPal, Google, and Twitter, among others. Napster has been credited as one of the fastest-growing businesses of all time, and its influence on information goods and data markets in the internet age cannot be overstated. In a study conducted between April 2000 and November 2001 by Sandvine titled \u201cPeer-to-peer File Sharing: The Impact of File Sharing on Service Provider Networks\u201d, network measurements revealed a notable shift in bandwidth consumption patterns due to the launch of new peer-to-peer tooling, as well as new compression algorithms such as .MP3. Specifically, the percentage of network bandwidth attributed to Napster traffic saw an increase from 23% to 30%, whereas web-related traffic experienced a slight decrease from 20% to 19%. By 2002, observations indicated that file-sharing traffic was consuming a substantial portion, up to 60%, of internet service providers' bandwidth. The creation of new information good markets comes downstream of new technological capabilities, with implications on the scope and scale of current data stream proliferation, clearly noticeable within the domination of internet user activity belonging to peer-to-peer network communications. Of course, peer-to-peer technology did not cease to advance after Napster, and the invention of \u201cswarms\u201d, a style of downloading and uploading essential to the development of Bram Cohen\u2019s BitTorrent, were invented for eDonkey2000 by Jed McCaleb \u2014 the eventual founder of Mt.Gox, Ripple Labs, and the Stellar Foundation. The proliferation of advanced packet exchange over the internet has led to entirely new types of information good markets, essentially boiling down to three main axioms; public and permanent data, selectively private data, and coveted but difficult-to-obtain data.

Bitcoin-native Data Markets Parent/Child Recursive Inscriptions While publishing directly to Bitcoin is hardly a new phenomenon, the popularization of Ord \u2014 released by Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor in 2022 \u2014 has led to a massive increase in interest and activity in Bitcoin-native publishing. While certainly some of this can be attributed to a newly formed artistic culture siphoning away activity and value from Ethereum \u2014 and other alternative businesses making erroneous claims of blockchain-native publishing \u2014 the majority of this volume comes downstream from the construction of these inscription transactions that use the SegWit discount via specially authored Taproot script, and the awareness of the immutability, durability, and availability of data offered solely by the Bitcoin blockchain. The SegWit discount was specifically created to incentivize the consolidation of unspent transaction outputs and limit the creation of excessive change in the UTXO set, but as for its implications on Bitcoin-native publishing, it has essentially created a substantial 75% markdown on the cost of bits within a block that are stuffed with arbitrary data within an inscription. This is far from a non-factor in the creation of a sustainable information goods market. Taking this one step further, the implementation of a self-referential inscription mechanism allows users to string data publishing across multiple Bitcoin blocks, limiting the costs from fitting a file into a single block auction. This implies both the ability to inscribe files beyond 4 MB, as well as the utility to reference previously inscribed material, such as executable software, code for generative art, or the image assets themselves. In the case of the recent Project Spartacus, recursive inscriptions that use what is known as a parent inscription were used in order to allow essentially a crowdfunding mechanism in order to publicly source the satoshis needed to publish the Afghan War logs onto the Bitcoin blockchain forever. This solves for the need of public and permanent publishing of known and available data by a pseudonymous set of users, but requires certain data availability during the minting process itself, which opens the door to centralized pressure points and potential censoring of inscription transactions within a public mint by nefarious mining pools. Precursive Inscriptions With the advent of Bitcoin-native inscriptions, the possibility of immutable, durable, and censorship-reduced publishing has come to fruition. The current iteration of inscription technology allows for users to post their data via a permanent but publicly propagated Bitcoin transaction. However, this reality has led to yet-to-be confirmed inscription transactions and their associated data being noticed while within the mempool itself. This issue can be mitigated by introducing encryption within the inscription process, leaving encrypted but otherwise innocuous data to be propagated by Bitcoin nodes and eventually published by Bitcoin miners, but with no ability to be censored due to content. This also removes the ability for inscriptions meant for speculation to be front-run by malicious collectors who pull inscription data from the mempool and rebroadcast it at an increased fee rate in order to be confirmed sooner. Precursive inscriptions aim to create the private, encrypted publishing of data spread out over multiple Bitcoin blocks that can be published at a whim via a recursive publishing transaction containing the private key to decrypt the previously inscribed data. For instance, a collective of whistleblowers could discreetly upload data to the Bitcoin blockchain, unbeknownst to miners or node runners, while deferring its publication until a preferred moment. Since the data will be encrypted during its initial inscribing phase, and since the data will be seemingly uncorrelated until it is recursively associated by the publishing transaction, a user can continually resign and propagate the time-locked parent inscription for extended durations of time. If the user cannot sign a further time-locked publishing transaction due to incarceration, the propagated publishing transaction will be confirmed after the time-lock period ends, thus giving the publisher a dead man\u2019s switch mechanism. The specially authored precursive inscription process presented in this article offers a novel approach to secure and censorship-resistant data publishing within the Bitcoin blockchain. By leveraging the inherent characteristics of the Bitcoin network, such as its decentralized and immutable nature, the method described here addresses several key challenges in the field of information goods, data inscription, and dissemination. The primary objective of precursive inscriptions is to enhance the security and privacy of data stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, while also mitigating the risk of premature disclosure. One of the most significant advantages of this approach is its ability to ensure that the content remains concealed until the user decides to reveal it. This process not only provides data security but also maintains data integrity and permanence within the Bitcoin blockchain. This leads us to the third and final fork of the information good data markets needed for the modern age; setting the price for wanted but currently unobtained bits. ReQuest ReQuest aims to create a novel data market allowing users to issue bounties for coveted data, seeking the secure and immutable storage of specific information on the Bitcoin blockchain. The primary bounty serves a dual role by covering publishing costs and rewarding those who successfully fulfill the request. Additionally, the protocol allows for the increase of bounties through contributions from other users, increasing the chances of successful fulfillment. Following an inscription submission, users who initiated the bounty can participate in a social validation process to verify the accuracy of the inscribed data. Implementing this concept involves a combination of social vetting to ensure data accuracy, evaluating contributions to the bounty, and adhering to specific contractual parameters measured in byte size. The bounty fulfillment process requires eligible fulfillers to submit their inscription transaction hash or a live magnet link for consideration. In cases where the desired data is available but not natively published on Bitcoin \u2014 or widely known but currently unavailable, such as a renowned .STL file or a software client update \u2014 the protocol offers an alternative method to social consensus for fulfillment, involving hashing the file and verifying the resulting SHA-256 output, which provides a foolproof means of meeting the bounty's requirements. The collaborative nature of these bounties, coupled with their ability to encompass various data types, ensures that ReQuest's model can effectively address a broad spectrum of information needs in the market. For ReQuest bounties involving large file sizes unsuitable for direct inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain, an alternative architecture known as Durabit has been proposed, in which a BitTorrent magnet link is inscribed and its seeding is maintained through a Bitcoin-native, time-locked incentive structure. Durabit Durabit aims to incentivize durable, large data distribution in the information age. Through time-locked Bitcoin transactions and the use of magnet links published directly within Bitcoin blocks, Durabit encourages active long-term seeding while even helping to offset initial operational costs. As the bounty escalates, it becomes increasingly attractive for users to participate, creating a self-sustaining incentive structure for content distribution. The Durabit protocol escalates the bounty payouts to provide a sustained incentive for data seeding. This is done not by increasing rewards in satoshi terms, but rather by increasing the epoch length between payouts exponentially, leveraging the assumed long-term price increase due to deflationary economic policy in order to keep initial distribution costs low. Durabit has the potential to architect a specific type of information goods market via monetized file sharing and further integrate Bitcoin into the decades-long, peer-to-peer revolution. These novel information good markets actualized by new Bitcon-native tooling can potentially reframe the fight for publishing, finding, and upholding data as the public square continues to erode. Increasing The Cost Of Conspiracy The information war is fought on two fronts; the architecture that incentivizes durable and immutable public data publishing, and the disincentivization of the large-scale gathering of personal data \u2014 often sold back to us in the form of specialized commercial content or surveilled by intelligence to aid in targeted propaganda, psychological operations, and the restriction of dissident narratives and publishers. The conveniences offered by walled garden apps and the private-sector-in-name-only networks are presented in order to access troves of metadata from real users. While user metrics can be inflated, the data gleaned from these bots are completely useless to data harvesting commercial applications such as Language Learning Models (LLMs) and current applicable AI interfaces. There are two axioms in which these algorithms necessitate verifiable data; the authenticity of the model\u2019s code itself, and the selected input it inevitably parses. As for the protocol itself, in order to ensure replicability of desired features and mitigate any harmful adversarial functionality, techniques such as hashing previously audited code upon publishing state updates could be utilized. Dealing with the input of these LLMs\u2019 learning fodder is seemingly also two-pronged; cryptographic sovereignty over that data which is actually valuable to the open market, and the active jamming of signal fidelity with data-chaff. It is perhaps not realistic to expect your everyday person to run noise-generating APIs that constantly feed the farmed, public datasets with heaps of lossy data, causing a data-driven feedback on these self-learning algorithms. But by creating alternative data structures and markets, built to the qualities of the specific \u201cinformation good\u201d, we can perhaps incentivize \u2014 at least subsidize \u2014 the perceived economic cost of everyday people giving up their convenience. The trend of deflation of publishing costs via digital and the interconnectivity of the internet has made it all the more essential for everyday people to at least take back control of their own metadata. It is not simply data that is the new commodity of the digital age, but your data: where you have been, what you have purchased, who you talk to, and the many manipulated whys that can be triangulated from the aforementioned wheres, whats, and whos. By mitigating the access to this data via obfuscation methods such as using VPNs, transacting with private payment tools, and choosing hardware powered by certain open source software, users can meaningfully increase the cost needed for data harvesting by the intelligence community and its private sector compatriots. The information age requires engaged participants, incentivized by the structures upholding and distributing the world\u2019s data \u2014 their data \u2014 on the last remaining alcoves of the public square, as well as encouraged and active retention of our own information. Most of the time, a random, large number represented in bits is of little value to a prospective buyer. And yet Bitcoin\u2019s store-of-value property is derived entirely from users being able to publicly and immutably publish a signature to the blockchain, possible only from the successful keeping of a private key secret. A baselayer Bitcoin transaction fee is priced not by the amount of value transferred, but by how many bytes of space is required in a specific block to articulate all its spend restrictions, represented in sat/vbyte. Bitcoin is a database that manages to incentivize users replicating its ledger, communicating its state updates, and utilizing large swaths of energy to randomize its consensus model.

To help law enforcement track illegal funds, an increasingly constraining set of anti-money-laundering measures is being implemented across the globe. For the past two decades, it has involved extensive know-your-customer obligations for financial institutions, forced to check their clients\u2019 identities, backgrounds, and the nature of their activities. This system, based on surveillance and the presumption of guilt, has helped the global financial system to efficiently fight criminals by cutting off their money flows. Or has it really? Real-life numbers tell a different story. Several independent studies have found that AML and KYC policies enable the authorities to recover less than 0.1% of criminal funds. AML efforts cost a hundred times these amounts, but more importantly, they start to threaten our basic right to privacy. The instances of absurd demands, like the one of a French man asked to justify the origin of \u20ac0.66 he wanted to deposit, are hardly raising any eyebrows anymore. Regulators face this ridicule without blinking, all while journalists and whistleblowers continue to expose billions of dollars laundered at the highest levels of the same institutions that put their regular clients through a bureaucratic nightmare. This suggests that sacrificing our right to privacy may not be justified by the results. The blockchain emerging as a free value-transferring system, as opposed to the KYC-gated fiat, has given hope to many personal freedom advocates. However, the regulators\u2019 response was to try and integrate both the acts of buying and transferring crypto into the current AML processes. Does it mean that the blockchain has been tamed, with both the entrance and the exit sealed by the AML regulation? Luckily, not yet. Or at least, not in every jurisdiction. For example, Switzerland, famous for its practical common sense, often allows companies to define their own risk exposure. This means that people can buy reasonable amounts of crypto without KYC. The Swiss example could prove valuable in stopping global AML practices from spiralling out of control and bringing a surveillance state upon the world that used to be known as \u201cfree\u201d. It is worth taking a closer look at, but first, let\u2019s see why the traditional AML approach is failing. KYC: the worst policy ever Few people dare to question the effectiveness of the current AML-KYC policies: no one wants to appear on the \u201ccriminal\u201d side of the debate. However, this debate is worth having, for our societies appear to be spending an indecent amount of money and effort on something that just does not work as intended. As noted by the director of Europol Rob Wainwright in 2018: \"The banks are spending $20 billion a year to run the compliance regime ... and we are seizing 1 percent of criminal assets every year in Europe.\" This thought was developed in one of the most comprehensive studies on the effectiveness of AML, published in 2020 by Ronald Pol from La Trobe University of Melbourne. It found that \u201cthe anti-money laundering policy intervention has less than 0.1 percent impact on criminal finances, compliance costs exceed recovered criminal funds more than a hundred times over, and banks, taxpayers and ordinary citizens are penalized more than criminal enterprises.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cblaming banks for not \u201cproperly\u201d implementing anti-money laundering laws is a convenient fiction. Fundamental problems may lie instead with the design of the core policy prescription itself.\u201d The study uses numerous sources from major countries and agencies, but its author admits it is nearly impossible to reconcile it all. Indeed, as strange as it may seem, despite billions of dollars and euros spent on AML, there is no generalized practice that could allow us to measure its effectiveness. The reality, however, is difficult to ignore. Despite the 20 years of modern KYC practices, organized crime and drug use continue to rise. What\u2019s more, a number of high-profile investigations have shown massive money laundering schemes happening at the very top of respected financial institutions. Crédit Suisse helping Bulgarian drug dealers, Wells Fargo (Wachovia) laundering money for the Mexican cartels, BNP Paribas facilitating operations of a Gabonese dictator\u2026 This is not to mention tax frauds initiated by the banks themselves: Danske Bank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and so many others have been proven guilty of scamming their countries. Yet, the regulators\u2019 response was to tighten the rules surrounding small retail-sized transfers and create extensive red tape for average law-abiding citizens. Why would they choose such cumbersome and inefficient measures? Perhaps the main reason here is that the organizations that define the rules are not responsible for either implementing them or for the end result. This lack of accountability could explain the increasingly absurd rules forcing financial institutions to maintain armies of compliance specialists, and regular people to jump through hoops to perform basic financial operations. This reality is not simply frustrating; in a broader historical and political context, it reveals worrisome trends. The increasingly intrusive regulations have set up a framework allowing to efficiently filter people. This means that under the pretext of fighting terrorism, different groups can be cut off from the financial system. This includes politically exposed people, dissenting voices, homeless, non-conformists\u2026 or those involved in the crypto space. Crypto AML The blockchain represents a major challenge for the fiat system because of its decentralized nature. Unlike centralized banks burdened with countless AML-related verifications, blockchain nodes simply run user-agnostic code. There\u2019s no way a blockchain like Bitcoin could be shaped into the AML mold, however, the intermediaries, also known as VASP (virtual asset service providers), can be. Their AML duties now include two major categories: buying crypto and transferring crypto. Transferring crypto falls under the prerogative of FATF, and most countries tend to implement this organization\u2019s recommendations sooner or later. These recommendations include the \u201ctravel rule\u201d, which implies that the data about the funds must \u201ctravel\u201d together with them. Currently, FATF recommends that any fiat transfer over $1000 must be accompanied by the information on the sender and the beneficiary. Different countries impose different thresholds for the travel rule, with $3,000 in the US, \u20ac1,000 in Germany, and \u20ac0 in France and Switzerland. The upcoming TFR regulation update will impose the mandatory KYC for every crypto transfer starting from \u20ac0 in all EU countries. The good thing about blockchain, though, is that it does not need intermediaries for transferring value. However, it needs them for buying crypto with fiat. The framework for buying crypto is determined by financial regulators and central banks, and this is where the countries\u2019 traditions play an important role. In France, a highly centralized country, an array of minute regulations, on-site inspections, and conferences define market practices in great detail. Switzerland, a decentralized country famous for its direct democracy based on consensus, typically grants financial intermediaries a certain autonomy in managing their own risk appetite. Switzerland is also the country where one of the most prominent liberal economists Friedrich Hayek founded the famous Mont Pelerin Society. Even back in 1947, its members were worried about dangers to individual liberty, noting that \u201cEven that most precious possession of Western Man, freedom of thought and expression, is threatened by the spread of creeds which, claiming the privilege of tolerance when in the position of a minority, seek only to establish a position of power in which they can suppress and obliterate all views but their own.\u201d Interestingly, a company called Mt Pelerin is operating today on the banks of the Geneva Lake, and this company is a crypto broker. Buying crypto in Switzerland Switzerland is far from the libertarian tax haven that many believe it is. It has succumbed to international pressure by de facto canceling its centuries-old banking secrecy tradition for foreign residents. Now, it is a member of the OECD treaty on the automatic exchange of information, and the zeal with which it applies FATF recommendations shows the willingness to shake off its previously sulfurous image. Indeed, FINMA decided to implement the travel rule for crypto starting from 0\u20ac, including for unhosted wallets, as early as 2017. In contrast, the \u201cconservative\u201d European Union will enforce this obligation only in 2024. However, when the funds don\u2019t explicitly leave the country, Switzerland still prefers to not micromanage its financial institutions and does not impose tons of paperwork for routine operations. It now stands as one of the rare countries on the old continent where people can buy crypto without being profiled. This means that companies like Mt Pelerin can process retail-size crypto transactions of CHF 1,000 per day without requiring the client to verify their identity. This does not mean an open bar, but rather a higher degree of autonomy. For example, Mt Pelerin implements its own fraud detection methods and reserves the right to refuse transactions that raise suspicion. In contrast to the heavily bureaucratic procedures that other countries impose, this approach actually boasts a high success rate at filtering out fraudulent transaction attempts. After all, the firms operating on the front lines often have a better understanding of the ever-evolving fraud tactics than government officials. For the sake of our societies, the Swiss approach to AML must be preserved and replicated. In a time when mass surveillance has become routine, and the CBDC development threatens to impose total control over our personal finances, we are closer than ever to the dystopia that Friedrich Hayek feared so much. By controlling our day-to-day transactions, any government, even the best-intentioned, could manipulate our lives and effectively \u201cobliterate any views but their own\u201d. That\u2019s why we buy Bitcoin, and that\u2019s why we want to do so without KYC. What about the criminals, you might ask? Shouldn\u2019t we cut off their access to money to curb their interest in underground entrepreneurship? Admittedly, after 20 years of modern AML, this thesis has proven itself wrong. So why not accept the fact that criminals enter our money flows and just follow that money to expose their operations? Continue reading Part 2 to learn more.

While wealth doesn\u2019t cause infallibility, these entities have the most to lose from making a mistake. They should be highly motivated to put substantial thought and research into the security of their bitcoin. Identifying the wealthiest bitcoin holders can be difficult, and asking them to reveal the full details of their security is unlikely to be successful. However, the bitcoin blockchain provides us with some valuable information. The transaction history and balances of all bitcoin addresses is publicly-available knowledge. What information can we gather? If an entity (person or group) owns a lot of bitcoin, it\u2019s possible that they keep their bitcoin spread across many different addresses, each with a smaller-sized balance. Those addresses wouldn\u2019t necessarily stand out from the crowd. In some cases, it\u2019s impossible to associate different addresses with the same wallet or owner. In other cases, association between addresses requires blockchain analysis, often relying on advanced techniques and assumptions which are not guaranteed to provide accurate information. Although it\u2019s challenging to definitively identify the wealthiest entities in terms of bitcoin, and precisely how much bitcoin they own, it\u2019s trivial to identify the wealthiest bitcoin addresses. There are a few websites that track these addresses in real time. The nature of these addresses can provide a lot of clues about how the bitcoin is secured. For example, if you are familiar with address types, you\u2019ll know that any address that begins with a \u201c1\u201d is a P2PKH address, and therefore must be a singlesig arrangement. Similarly, any address that begins with \u201cbc1q\u201d and has a length of 42 characters is a P2WPKH address, and must also be a singlesig address. Bitcoin held by one of these address types isn\u2019t utilizing multisig protection. Using SSS or MPC would be the only way to achieve institutional-grade security, as discussed in our article covering thresholds. Meanwhile, any address that begins with a \u201c3\u201d is a P2SH address. Any address that begins with \u201cbc1q\u201d and has a length of 62 characters is a P2WSH address. These address types have the possibility of utilizing multisig. However, only after bitcoin has been spent out of these addresses will the custody structure be revealed. Some P2SH addresses are actually singlesig, a structure that was temporarily popular while SegWit was being initially adopted. Therefore, if one of these address types has never been spent out of, the custody structure is unknown. Ready to upgrade your Bitcoin security?

These six addresses were created by their owners in 2010 or 2011, when bitcoin had a much smaller value and was not taken as seriously as it is today. Five of the six have never been spent from, and the other one made its last withdrawal in July of 2010. The remaining 75 addresses use a variety of custody structures. Let\u2019s break it down: Address Type Addresses (%) Total Bitcoin Balance (%) Singlesig 53 (70.7%) 1,745,905 (67.6%) Multisig 16 (21.3%) 608,773 (23.6%) Unknown 6 (8.0%) 226,205 (8.8%) As explained in our article discussing institutional-grade threshold security, it\u2019s likely that the 53 singlesig addresses are using either SSS or MPC. Two of the addresses, however, are unlikely to be using MPC, because they were created before 2018, when the first-ever MPC threshold protocols for ECDSA were invented. It\u2019s possible that these addresses are using SSS instead. The 16 addresses that we know are using multisig have all been spent out of, and in doing so they have revealed their specific quorum structure. There is a wide assortment of quorums: 4 instances of 3-of-5 3 instances of 2-of-3 2 instances of 2-of-2 1 instance of 3-of-9 1 instance of 4-of-8 1 instance of 3-of-8 1 instance of 4-of-6 1 instance of 3-of-6 1 instance of 2-of-6 1 instance of 3-of-4 The 2-of-2 quorums stand out as the only quorums in the list which don\u2019t offer inherent protection from single points of failure. While a distributed 2-of-2 multisig can protect against theft, it requires other methods to protect against loss (such as each key using distributed SSS or MPC shares). You can read more about how different quorums protect from theft and loss to varying degrees, in our broader multisig article.

Conclusions After looking at the data, at least one thing is clear. Among the owners of the wealthiest bitcoin addresses\u2014some of whom include the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges and even the U.S. Department of Justice\u2014there is no consensus on the best method to secure bitcoin. Some of these entities use multisig addresses, with typical quorums like 2-of-3 and 3-of-5, but there are several unusual quorums as well. Many entities use singlesig addresses, which could be utilizing SSS or MPC. The details surrounding SSS or MPC threshold quorums are never publicly recorded on the blockchain, limiting the extent of this investigation. It\u2019s possible that some of these singlesig addresses are not employing any threshold security at all, which would mean that certain stashes of bitcoin currently worth more than $400M are notably under-secured. As we covered in a recent article, multisig always has a higher security ceiling than singlesig. When a singlesig address is used (as is the case with at least 70% of the addresses holding more than 10,000 BTC) there is a missed opportunity for additional security. While singlesig does provide some benefits for spending convenience and transaction fees, one might expect these benefits to be less important than security, for an entity holding bitcoin worth millions or billions of dollars. The truth behind why singlesig addresses are so commonly found at the top levels is unclear. It may amount to a lack of education, or a historical lack of products and services leveraging the combination of SSS and MPC alongside multisig. Luckily, Unchained has pioneered a simple path to access these combinations, unlocking the highest levels of security obtainable. For private wealth and enterprise clients, we offer a vault product built with a foundation of multisig, and keys that can be spread amongst institutional key agents. Each of these key agents can deploy their own threshold security using SSS or MPC. Book a free consultation! Originally published on Unchained.com.

The main areas of focus for these grants center around Latin America, Asia, and Africa. This announcement comes only a few months after their last round of grants in December, also donating $500,000 to worldwide Bitcoin projects. While the HRF did not disclose exactly how much money each project is receiving, the following 14 projects are the recipients of today's round of grants worth $500,000 in total: USD E-Cash for Bitcoin by Calle, a USD-based Chaumian e-cash system built on the Cashu protocol. This system aims to enable private, affordable, and stable use of USD-denominated credits, all interoperable with the broader Bitcoin Lightning network. USD E-Cash is positioned as an alternative to major stablecoins, in that it does not have any connection to the traditional banking system. The core idea is that activists anywhere can exchange their bitcoin for privacy-protecting dollar-denominated E-Cash, with the trade-off of being custodial. Funding will support the full development of this project. BTCPay Server, a free, open-source, self-hosted payment solution that enables individuals and businesses to accept Bitcoin payments. BTCPay provides a platform for merchants in difficult political and economic climates to process global payments, manage crowdfunding campaigns, and offers developers opportunities to kickstart their projects on top of Bitcoin. Funding for BTCPay Server will support UI/UX improvements, feature enhancements, contributor rewards, and training programs. BOB Builders Residency Program, an in-person residency for Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) developers located in Thailand. The new cohort of developers will focus on \u201cToolings to Reinforce Bitcoin\u2019s Decentralization,\u201d to combat centralizing forces in the software ecosystem. The previous cohort, also supported by HRF, focused on privacy. Funds will be used to support the residents of this second cohort, covering living and travel expenses. Yibaochina.com 议报中文, a popular news platform led by Citizen Power Initiatives for China, serves Chinese scholars, intellects, and writers abroad. Dedicated to promoting democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in the global Chinese-speaking community, Yibao has gained a significant readership, particularly in pro-democracy communities within China. HRF\u2019s grant will support the wages of writers, editors, and translators of the site, as well as social media promotion efforts, as they translate Bitcoin educational materials and news items into Chinese for wide circulation into the world\u2019s biggest dictatorship. Bitcoin Innovation Hub, a physical space and community center promoting the socioeconomic transformation of refugees, asylum seekers, and other vulnerable communities led by Noble Nyangoma in Kampala, Uganda. The hub offers a range of vocational training and financial literacy to women and men in various fields, where they learn how to use and how to earn Bitcoin, regardless of what kind of ID they hold. Funding will support the addition of vocational classes (ie. digital skills, carpentry, and baking) for thousands of students in the East African region, enabling stateless communities to earn Bitcoin for their work. BITCOIN DADA, a non-profit initiative founded by Kenyan entrepreneur Lorraine Marcel, aims to empower African women through financial education. BITCOIN DADA provides a safe space for women to learn about Bitcoin as a tool for financial freedom and build up their skill set. Funds will support the expansion across Africa, the creation of multilingual educational resources, and promote women-led businesses adopting Bitcoin. The grants in this round to Bitcoin DADA and to the Bitcoin Innovation Hub are generously supported by Strike\u2019s nonprofit initiative. The Bitcoin Design Foundation, which supports the Bitcoin Design Community, is dedicated to providing design infrastructure and resources to bitcoin designers and developers, including those building for people living under authoritarian regimes and in developing economies. The funding will support the development of the Bitcoin UI Kit (a resource that help people learn, design, prototype, and build full bitcoin applications) as well as the addition of new and emerging techniques for privacy and self-sovereignty in the Bitcoin Design Guide. Improving the UX of Bitcoin wallets remains one of its top goals. Bitcoin Op-Tech, a technical Bitcoin newsletter renowned for its industry-leading resources, technologies, and techniques tailored for Bitcoin developers, businesses, and organizations. The newsletter regularly covers issues of privacy, censorship-resistance, and decentralization which are core to HRF\u2019s mission. Additionally, Bitcoin Op-Tech offers workshops, documentation, original research, and case studies. Funds will be allocated towards operational expenses and growth strategies. Damus Android, a communications application using the nostr protocol. Developed by Will Casarin, Damus ensures free speech online \u2014 critical for people living in difficult political environments without being censored \u2014 and enables users to receive Bitcoin through its \u201czapping\u201d functionality. Funding will be used to develop the Damus application for Android devices, helping to potentially onboard millions of new users in authoritarian countries and the developing world. Bitcoin Core Developer Pablo Martin, whose initial work addressed a vulnerability that caused a Bitcoin node to crash and shut down. Martin continues to contribute, review, and put forth proposals advancing Bitcoin, including the http-rest interface, bitcoin-cli, p2p, rpc, and the wallet within the Bitcoin repository, while also contributing to Bitcoin Core GUI repositories. Funds will support his ongoing contributions to Bitcoin development, the likes of which are crucial to keeping Bitcoin a secure tool for activists everywhere. LNbits, a multi-user and account system for the Lightning Network, enables users to create separate Lightning wallets for friends and family. Built by software developer Ben Arc, LNbits aims to decentralize custodianship and provides users with a robust suite of Bitcoin tools they can run for themselves, for others, or as part of a stack. Funding will support the core contributors\u2019 salaries, bounties, and educational outreach efforts through workshops and video tutorials. Bitcoin Policy Summit 2024, a one-day conference bringing together policymakers, academics, and industry leaders to explore the opportunities and challenges of Bitcoin. The event aims to reshape the narrative surrounding Bitcoin, advocate for its benefits in liberal democracies, and highlight its potential to undermine closed societies. Funding will support event logistics, speaker travel, and attendance by human rights advocates. Bitcoin for Billions, a series of informative videos created by Bitcoin educator, Paco de la India. The videos, initially available in four regional languages \u2014 Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, and Gujarati \u2014 aim to have a wide audience among the 750 million people in India who speak these languages. Topics include the concept of bitcoin as freedom money and practical guidance on purchasing and self-custodying bitcoin safely, items which are increasingly important under a regime that continues to trend more authoritarian. The grant will be used for research, content creation, translation, and promotion of the videos. Scalar School, founded by Luciana Ferreira, a Brazil-based Bitcoin and Lightning development program dedicated to training early-stage Bitcoin developers. The school equips students with a comprehensive understanding of Bitcoin development, philosophy, and community engagement, preparing them for future opportunities in esteemed programs such as Chaincode Labs. The grant will go towards teachers\u2019 salaries, training workshops, and university outreach and will give a boost towards developers living in South America.

One such solution is a hardware wallet, a physical device that allows you to securely hold the keys to your bitcoin. But hardware wallets aren\u2019t the only option for storing your bitcoin keys\u2014there are also software wallets, paper wallets, and even \u201cbrain wallets.\u201d So why specifically choose a hardware wallet? 1. Keep your keys offline, protected from remote attacks Hardware wallets enable you to generate and hold the keys to your bitcoin entirely offline, known as cold storage. This stands in contrast to hot wallets, which are more susceptible to remote attacks such as malware and SIM swap attacks (still more secure than a custodian or an exchange!). You can think of this as similar to building a ship in a bottle. Your wallet\u2019s seed, which is used to generate the keys to your bitcoin, is generated inside the device and cannot be digitally exported. At no point do the keys ever leave the device. Even if a hardware wallet is connected to a virus-infected computer (which is not recommended), the keys would still be protected, often in a secure element. When you want to move your bitcoin, you author a transaction using wallet software, send it to the hardware wallet, sign it on the hardware wallet itself using your private keys, and then send it back to the internet-connected wallet software for it to be broadcast to the bitcoin network. 2. Protect against physical attacks If someone were to gain physical access to your hardware wallet, there are unique features hardware wallets offer that help you defend against attacks. Some of these security features include a secure element, firmware verification, and PINs for first-layer defense. Secure elements A secure element is a microprocessor used to isolate, store, and protect sensitive data. In a hardware wallet, a secure element provides a higher level of protection against physical compromise compared to the standard environment on a mobile phone, desktop, or laptop. For example, this makes it more difficult to compromise your device via fault attacks, side-channel attacks, and cold boot attacks. Firmware verification Firmware verification is a way to verify the validity of a hardware wallet\u2019s onboard software. This protects against counterfeit versions and supply-chain attacks. Verifying the firmware ensures the use of a genuine, unaltered version of the hardware. Wallet software from manufacturers like Trezor, Ledger, and others verify the device firmware every time you connect them to your PC. Access PINs Access PINs in many hardware wallets help prevent anyone but the owner from getting immediate access to the ability to sign with the keys stored on the device. In most cases, the penalty for failing to properly enter the PIN over a certain number of tries is an increasing delay between incorrect guesses. With some hardware wallets, exceeding the number of allowable PIN guesses can result in a factory reset of the device or even render it permanently unusable. Duress PINs A duress PIN is a security feature that can help protect your bitcoin in the event of a $5 wrench attack. Duress PINs are particularly important for hardware wallets (due to them being used to secure larger amounts of bitcoin), and the available functionality is particularly robust in some cases. For example, the Coldcard hardware wallet offers three types of duress PINs: one that unlocks a decoy wallet, one that destroys the seed upon entry, and one that creates a countdown to customizable \u201cbrick modes\u201d. If you end up in a duress scenario, these tools offer you confidence that attackers won\u2019t be able to access your primary bitcoin keys\u2014if any at all. 3. Provides a smaller attack surface It\u2019s possible to store your keys offline with a laptop or desktop and secure them from physical attacks. However, the general-purpose architectures of these devices present a larger attack surface for skilled attackers. This means there are more ways for attackers to exploit software, firmware, and hardware to engineer ways to steal your private keys. In contrast, hardware wallets are built with specialized hardware that simplifies their functionality to very specific tasks and limits their connectivity to the internet and other devices. Even with a secure element to keep key data behind a firewall, some hardware wallets restrict the way they physically connect with external devices\u2014air-gapped hardware wallets primarily interface with other devices via microSD card. Many manufacturers also offer bitcoin-only firmware to further simplify functionality. Hardware wallets may be more limited in functionality and convenience than general purposes devices, but that limited functionality also means limited vulnerability. This also has the side benefit of creating less risk for new holes to be discovered that manufacturers must plug with firmware updates or hardware revisions.

Prepare for increasing values You may think you don\u2019t own enough bitcoin for it to be worth the effort to buy a hardware wallet and learn how to securely hold your keys offline. One reason to get a hardware wallet now is to prepare for bitcoin\u2019s upward price swings. It\u2019s common bitcoin wisdom to treat your holdings as if they\u2019re worth 10x what they are today\u2014historically, a move like this can come quickly and unexpectedly. Additionally, if your bitcoin holdings would be uncomfortably large for standard singlesig self-custody at a 10x value increase, it may be time to consider a more secure self-custody model such as multisig. 5. Confirm addresses on-device Because bitcoin transactions are irreversible, it\u2019s important to be certain when you send bitcoin that it goes to the correct address. This is important for both sending bitcoin to someone else and sending bitcoin to a wallet controlled by the keys on the hardware wallet(s) you own. With software wallets, malware could replace a real address with an attacker\u2019s address in the UI, making it difficult to verify its authenticity. There\u2019s also \u201cclipper\u201d malware, which switches the receiving address in your computer\u2019s clipboard, and other attack vectors. Hardware wallets help with this by including a physical screen that displays the address you want to send funds to, allowing you to verify it prior to spending. As long as your device hasn\u2019t been physically compromised, you can be confident that the address you\u2019re shown is controlled by the keys stored offline on the device. If you\u2019re sending funds to a remote recipient, it\u2019s best to confirm the address you\u2019re sending to through multiple channels. 6. An ideal environment to generate your own entropy All bitcoin wallets depend on entropy\u2014randomness\u2014to generate seeds, and seeds are the master secret that generates your bitcoin private keys. Entropy can be generated in many ways, from basic on-device random number generators, to long strings of random text entry, to dice rolls or playing cards. Dice rolls are widely considered one of the best ways to generate your own entropy, minimizing the involvement of third-parties in generating the randomness needed to initialize a bitcoin wallet. Some hardware wallets, such as Coldcard, allow you to enter dice rolls on-device to generate a seed phrase. You can press 1\u20136 for each roll and it will use the rolls to generate your seed. While you don\u2019t need a hardware wallet to generate your own entropy (you could do so on a permanently offline laptop, for example), hardware wallets uniquely allow you to do so in a way that\u2019s convenient and secure. Generating your own entropy in the physical world can be fun and a great learning exercise, but it\u2019s pointless without the right environment to help you preserve the marginal security you may obtain by doing so. 7. Travel more securely Traveling with small amounts of bitcoin can be easily done with a mobile phone or another less secure device, but larger amounts of bitcoin require more forethought. Traveling with keys on a laptop computer or mobile device is risky because these devices are usually hot (internet-connected), have more limited physical protections, and have larger attack surfaces. Hardware wallets offer convenience and security if you need to keep one or more bitcoin keys on your person while traveling. You don\u2019t have to worry about sketchy WiFi connections or USB ports, you can use duress features as described above if someone were to physically attack you, and you\u2019re more protected if your device becomes lost, stolen, or confiscated (attackers would have to do defeat the hardware wallet\u2019s purpose-built security). And they still offer convenient access if you need to spend. 8. Enhance the security of multisig setups Multisig wallets are built by combining multiple keys (versus singlesig wallets that use just one). Requiring more than one key to spend bitcoin adds security and redundancy to your wallet, making them useful for securing larger amounts of bitcoin. The more secure the individual keys involved in constructing a multisig wallet are, the more secure the multisig wallet is itself. Hardware wallets enable you to conveniently build a multisig wallet with clearly delineated keys securely held offline. Like with singlesig, hardware wallets also let you verify multisig addresses offline when sending bitcoin. Using multiple hardware wallets is a natural fit for multisig because multisig is often used for maximizing security and redundancy for large amounts of cold storage bitcoin, a goal which physical devices and seed phrase backups also help you to achieve. Start with self-custody The first step to upgrading your bitcoin security is always to take self-custody, whether hot or cold, to eliminate the risk involved with trusting custodians such as exchanges. From there, you can explore additional security tools, such as multisig, to find the right balance of security and accessibility for your circumstances. Ready to upgrade your Bitcoin security?

This strategic decision marks a pivotal juncture in El Salvador's Bitcoin journey since the introduction of the Bitcoin Law, which has drawn both admiration and skepticism worldwide. Amidst a cacophony of critiques ranging from allegations of human rights violations to inadequate modern infrastructure, El Salvador has stood committed, weathering storms of disapproval from traditional finance stalwarts and even fervent Bitcoin maximalists on Twitter (X) Spaces. The veil of ambiguity surrounding the size of El Salvador's Bitcoin reserves, a point of contention and criticism for many, has now been decisively lifted, ushering in a new era of transparency and confidence in the nation's commitment to fostering a thriving Bitcoin-friendly ecosystem. With this groundbreaking move, Salvadorans and Bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide have the ability to audit El Salvador's Bitcoin reserves and can see all inbound and outbound transactions. This audacious step wasn't mandated but was taken willingly, embodying El Salvador's commitment to its citizens' trust and the global Bitcoin community's ethos of openness. Unsurprisingly, shortly after Bukele announced El Salvador\u2019s Bitcoin address, Bitcoiners began to send donations to the wallet, with nearly 6 Million Sats in transactions as of this writing. To date, plebs can track El Salvador\u2019s daily 1 bitcoin DCA purchases. In this historic moment, El Salvador not only charts a new course in financial governance but also silences its critics by setting a precedent of leading by example in responsibly disclosing and managing its modest but modern sovereign Bitcoin wealth reserves. With 5,689 Bitcoins\u2014valued at $385,111,456 USD as of this writing\u2014El Salvador has secured its digital wealth and aptly navigated the treacherous waters of international politics. The decision to shift its Bitcoin holdings from Bitgo, an American custodian, to a vault within its sovereign borders wasn't just a public relations masterstroke; it was a strategic imperative. Given the strained relations between the American government and El Salvador over the Bitcoin Law, the mounting holdings under Bitgo's custody risked becoming entangled in potential sanctions and regulatory quagmires. This decisive action safeguards El Salvador's financial autonomy and showcases a shrewd understanding of the intricacies of the American regulatory landscape. While the disclosure of the reserves has garnered widespread approval, there may have been compelling and strategic reasons behind the nation's initial reluctance to divulge its complete holdings. Nayib Bukele's affirmation that only a \u201cbig chunk\u201d of the total Bitcoin reserves has been transferred to cold storage underscores a nuanced understanding of the country\u2019s strategic financial management. In the complex realm of nation-states navigating the uncharted waters of a Bitcoin Standard, maintaining a degree of opacity can be a prudent strategy. El Salvador, in its quest to carve a distinct path in the world, has tactically kept some cards close to its chest, waiting for the opportune moment to unveil its Bitcoin wealth in a calculated move. This wise approach reflects a careful balancing act between transparency and strategic advantage in the dynamic landscape of geopolitics. Bukele shed light on El Salvador's Bitcoin holdings in earlier tweets, surpassing their earlier acquisition strategies and dollar-cost averaging efforts. Contrary to speculations circulating on social media, Bukele revealed a multifaceted approach that had propelled the nation's Bitcoin reserves. Beyond mere purchases, El Salvador's innovative visa program, profits from Bitcoin-to-dollar exchanges held in escrow, revenue from government services, and mining endeavors have collectively contributed to a handsome Bitcoin treasury. This revelation further dispels misconceptions propagated by armchair quarterbacks and highlights El Salvador's innovative courage in leveraging diverse avenues to bolster its growing Bitcoin wealth. Disclosing El Salvador's Bitcoin reserves represents a significant stride toward transparency and accountability for its citizens. Yet, it's crucial to recognize that there will always be a segment of critics who demand more and complain about every detail in an attempt to find fault. However, it's essential to remember that these measures are not solely aimed at appeasing detractors. Instead, they serve as a foundational step in creating a positive business environment where Bitcoiners can confidently establish their ventures, knowing that the country is dedicated to their success. The ultimate goal for Bukele and El Salvador extends beyond merely silencing critics; it's about transforming the nation into a prosperous hub of opportunity for Salvadorans. In a stroke of genius, El Salvador has built its own digital Fort Knox, with the exceptional feature that citizens can verify the existence of the funds. The Salvadoran government aims to nurture a culture of trust and investment in the country's future by rewarding proof-of-work and low-time preference. This vision encompasses building a new El Salvador where citizens can thrive, seize opportunities at home, and contribute to the nation's growth, rather than seeking elusive promises abroad. As El Salvador continues its journey toward economic empowerment and progress, these strategic moves serve as foundational pillars for a brighter and more prosperous future.

The HSM server has introduced functionality to support atomically swapping two statechains, as well as enforcing an atomic exchange of a statechain for a Lightning payment. This is the first example of concretely defined and built interactions between statechains and the Lightning Network. Synergy between both protocols has been postulated since the concept of a statechain was originally proposed by Ruben Somsen, specifically as a way to solve the limitation of having to transfer a whole statechain UTXO at once. Basic Statechain Swaps In order to support the new swap protocols, the HSM server needs to add some new fields to its database entries tracking each statechain it is facilitating. To facilitate the statechain to statechain swap, the server needs to track: Batch_id: a value to associate statechains being swapped in a group. Batch-time: a time that starts a counter after which the statechains can be \u201creclaimed\u201d if the swap fails. Locked: a value indicating whether or not the statechain is locked and restricted from regular transfers. This allows the HSM server to track and enforce all the variables necessary to ensure a safe atomic swap. When initiating a swap, users have to communicate with each other directly in order to establish a shared batch_id between them. From this point they trade all the necessary information required to facilitate a normal statechain transfer, and send that information plus the batch_id and batch-time to the server. They essentially start the regular transfer process, but also attach the variables to connect the individual statechains as participating in a swap together and how long the timeout period is for that. The server at this point will apply a lock to every statechain using the same batch_id in the transfer process. Until the timeout expires, or all of the statechains in its database using the same batch_id have been unlocked by the current owners, the server will not approve any transfers. A neat thing about the way the HSM enforces the swap logic is that it doesn\u2019t matter who contacts the server first. When the server gets a message using a batch_id, it checks every statechain in its database and if there is a pre-existing batch-time for that batch_id it sets it as the same. This ensures that no matter who registers the swap first they all use the same time value for the timeout function. Each client involved in the swap at this point checks for and downloads the messages that initiated the transfer protocol, and upon verifying they\u2019re correct sends a message to the server to unlock their statechain, removing the transfer restrictions. Whenever anyone attempts to finalize a transfer on the receiver side of any of the statechains involved in the swap, the server checks to make sure all of the statechains with the same batch_id are unlocked. If even a single one with the related batch_id is still locked the server will finalize a transfer for none of them. If a swap doesn\u2019t succeed before the timeout, the server will continue restricting the finalization of the swap transfer, but will let the current owners initialize a new transfer to themselves to effectively cancel the swap. Lightning Latch The Lightning Latch functionality, swapping a statechain for a Lightning payment, works very similarly to the statechain to statechain swap. Here are the new fields the server must track for the Lightning swap: Batch_id: a value to associate statechains being swapped in a group. Batch-time: a time that starts a counter after which the statechains can be \u201creclaimed\u201d if the swap fails. Pre-image: the preimage of the Lightning payment, which is generated by the HSM server. Locked_1 and locked_2: there are two lock fields for the Lightning swap, one authorized by each user involved. Just like with the statechain to statechain swap, the users establish and share a random batch_id. The current statechain owner then messages the server with the batch_id and statechain involved and requests it generates a hashlock preimage for a Lightning payment. This user then generates a Lightning invoice using this preimage, and the second user contacts the server to confirm it generated the preimage. The current statechain owner then begins the statechain transfer process and uploads the transfer message to the server. After confirmation of that, the second user trying to swap for the statechain initiates the Lightning payment. At this time the server is the only one with the preimage, so the statechain owner cannot finalize the payment yet. The current owner after verifying the pending Lighting payment sends the server an unlock message to remove the first lock on the statechain. The receiver finally verifies the transfer message, and if valid messages the server to remove their lock as well. Now with both locks removed, the HSM server will release the preimage to the current statechain owner to finalize the Lightning payment, and will finalize the statechain transfer to the receiver. This scheme does require trusting the statechain operator to function honestly, but that is fundamentally not a change to the pre-existing trust model of using a statechain in general. At no time does the operator have control over users\u2019 funds, nor do they learn anything about the Lightning payment details. What Is This Good For? This scheme is a far cry from the originally posited interaction between statechains and Lightning channels, stacking one on top of the other, but even as a simple starting point this presents functional utility for existing Lightning users. Rebalancing channels is a necessary thing for many nodes, if the capacity is entirely pushed to one side or the other the utility of that channel is limited for routing payments. Many businesses and users have started experimenting with using Liquid as a mechanism for this due to on-chain fees rising and making swaps into and out of the Lightning Network more expensive. Statechains offer an alternative mechanism to a federated sidechain to alleviate some of the fee expenses associated with channel balance management. Instead of having to swap out to the mainchain directly, or use a sidechain, funds can be swapped to a statechain and held there until they are needed for swapping funds back into a channel. Similar savings in fees can be had while still maintaining the ability to unilaterally claim your funds on the mainchain. Another potential use case (TRIGGER WARNING) would be the possibility of more efficient marketplaces for trading ordinals. Since ordinals are simply an index scheme tracking paths backwards in the transaction history to specific satoshis, they can easily be lifted off-chain onto a statechain. That dynamic in combination with Lightning Latch could allow cheaper and faster off-chain purchases of ordinals. Someone could build a marketplace where they can be sold instantly off-chain over the Lightning Network. It\u2019s even possible one day if Lightning clients could become aware somehow of which statechain operators specific Lightning nodes trust that Latch could be used to help route payments by passing statechains around between different nodes instead of using conventional Lightning channels. On the front of pure statechain to statechain transfers, this offers the potential for a message passing layer to recreate coinjoin like system mixing coins off-chain, similar to the original mixing functionality in Commerceblock\u2019s first statechain implementation.

In a new report, Standard Chartered analysts cited strong inflows into recently launched spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. as a primary driver of their bullish outlook. The bank believes these \"sticky\" institutional flows will continue propelling Bitcoin's price. Standard Chartered has emerged as one of the more Bitcoin-friendly legacy banks, with an active research team covering Bitcoin. Previously, the bank's analysts had predicted Bitcoin would reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. But with Bitcoin's strong performance in early 2024, the team is now forecasting that it will hit $150,000 within the next nine months. Standard Chartered Bank analysts led by Geoffrey Kendrick wrote: \"For 2024, given the sharper-than-expected price gains year-to-date, we now see potential for the price to reach the $150,000 level by year-end, up from our previous estimate of $100,000.\" They expect the rally to continue into 2025, with Bitcoin potentially trading as high as $250,000 next year before settling around $200,000. The updated price prediction comes as spot bitcoin ETFs got approved in the US earlier this year. Standard Chartered believes these regulated investment vehicles are bringing significant institutional demand. Combined with Bitcoin's fixed supply and other positive fundamentals, the bank sees room for substantial additional upside. Based on increasing mainstream adoption, Standard Chartered expects new highs. Their bold call illustrates a growing willingness among major financial institutions to make ambitious bitcoin price forecasts. If achieved, a climb to $150,000 would mark a 120% gain from current levels near $68,000.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. After a lengthy legal dispute, London\u2019s High Court of Justice has formally determined that Australian computer scientist Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. One of the great mysteries of the Bitcoin community since its inception has been quite related to the inception itself: who is Satoshi Nakamoto? This pseudonym is all we have to go on for the identity of that developer or developers who created Bitcoin: writing its white paper, mining the Genesis Block, carrying out transactions, and correspondence with persons in the pre-Bitcoin cryptographic community. And yet, when Bitcoin began receiving the tiniest bits of recognition from the broader world, he formally relinquished any authority over Bitcoin as a project and vanished. In the years since, there have been many attempts to determine Satoshi\u2019s identity, but nothing has borne fruit. However, members of the community have not only tried to unmask Satoshi from an outsider\u2019s perspective. There have additionally been efforts from various people to publicly claim that they, in fact, are the true creators of Bitcoin. A particular standout in this respect has been the software developer Craig Wright, who made this bold statement in 2016 and has faced years of ridicule from prominent members of the Bitcoin community. Although Wright has fought back against his detractors through litigious action, he has faced repeated defeats on this front. Still, the threat of libel suits has been an ongoing specter over media coverage of Wright\u2019s 8-year claim, and many of his actions have gone underreported as a result. Eventually, this stifling atmosphere led the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) to take a bold step in 2021 when it sued him in British courts to obtain a ruling over whether Wright has copyright ownership of Bitcoin\u2019s white paper. This legal battle has not surfaced much in public discourse since this first filing, for understandable reasons, even as British courts ruled against Wright\u2019s Satoshi claims in suits unrelated to COPA. Although settlement options were pitched by Wright\u2019s legal team, ultimately COPA refused all of them, under the logic that such a settlement would require tacitly accepting his claim. If Craig Wright was only a fraud, after all, he would have no power to offer any concessions on the nature of Bitcoin\u2019s ownership. After years of an apparent holding pattern, the trial began in February 2024. A particularly noteworthy tactic used by Wright\u2019s team \u201crepeatedly\u201d was that, if Wright was not truly Satoshi Nakamoto, then the real Satoshi would have to unmask himself to disprove the claim definitively. More than anything else, this particular claim has unearthed a large volume of interest in Satoshi\u2019s true identity. For example, as the trial was approaching in January 2024, nearly $1 million worth of Bitcoin was transferred into Satoshi\u2019s wallet from an anonymous source, arousing coverage from major media sites that Bitcoin\u2019s creator might reveal himself. The hubbub from this event led to rampant speculation, as image macros began circulating claiming that characters from the two simplified Japanese scripts, katakana and hiragana, would be pronounced as \u201cSatoshi Nakamoto\u201d while resembling the English letters to the name of popular Satoshi candidate Hal Finney. Even if Bitcoin was created by enthusiasts in the codebreaking and cryptography scene, this claim is somewhat dubious, as it would require mixing and matching two different Japanese scripts in a haphazard manner. For example, the syllable \u201cto\u201d in Satoshi is a different alphabet than the same syllable in Nakamoto, and there seems to be no steady rule for when these two writing systems alternate. Still, Hal Finney has been dead since 2014, which would explain why Satoshi has remained silent as Bitcoin blossomed to the extreme extent it has in the last ten years. Source If nothing else, renewed speculation of this nature was a clear sign that the trial had captured Bitcoiners\u2019 collective imagination on the subject. It was a major point of interest then, when multiple early developers and Bitcoin collaborators began submitting private correspondence with Satoshi into the public record to be used as evidence. Adam Back, developer of the 90s \u201cHashcash\u201d protocol that directly inspired Bitcoin\u2019s mining algorithm, revealed a brief email correspondence initiated by Satoshi where the two discussed Hashcash\u2019s relevance to Bitcoin. Early collaborator Martii \u201cSirius\u201d Malmi, on the other hand, released a much larger tranche of emails on a broad range of looser topics, totaling 120 pages in all. These emails gave new insight into the personality of Bitcoin\u2019s creator and likely would never have surfaced without the criminal proceedings. In any event, as soon as the proceedings had concluded, Justice James Mallor cited the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d as he made an immediate ruling against Wright\u2019s claims. COPA released some of the evidence against Wright independently, including the particularly damning accusation that Wright has used ChatGPT to forge documents \u201con an industrial scale.\" Their legal team accused Wright of a \u201cmassive campaign of dishonesty and forgery\u201d that \u201cstray[ed] into farce,\" going so far as to claim that Wright was actively fabricating new documents during the course of the five-week trial. Mallor claimed he would give a more detailed account of his reasons at a later date, but the actual verdict is clear: Craig Wright is not Satoshi, is not the author of the white paper, and did not create Bitcoin or its software. The importance of this ruling is clear for two main reasons: not only does it prevent Wright from continuing his years-long practice of initiating defamation lawsuits against individuals and media outlets that deny his Satoshi claim, it also prevents him from suing developers on the basis of copyright infringement. This \u201cchilling effect\u201d on active Bitcoin developers is a major reason why COPA decided to take on this battle. If nothing else, a firm legal precedent will make it substantially easier to dismiss similar claims in the future. COPA has filed a purely civil suit against Wright, which is unlikely to lead to any sort of direct monetary reparation and certainly will not result in incarceration. Still, the full written judgment has yet to be released. Craig Wright\u2019s extended campaign to prove that he is the true Satoshi Nakamoto has turned into one of the long-running features of the Bitcoin space, even as he spent long periods of time under the radar. Around half of Bitcoin\u2019s entire lifespan has included Wright as a figure, resurfacing from time to time to aggressively defend his \u201creputation and intellectual property\u201d as the true genius behind Bitcoin. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to how the man, personally, will take this new defeat in his mission. Will he quietly retire from the scene? Will he continue seeking other legal battles on the subject in different jurisdictions? Will the British legal system somehow censure him over this behavior? It\u2019s unclear whether or not we can definitively close the book on Craig Wright after this defeat. Still, it\u2019s important to consider how the whole affair has sparked interest in Bitcoin\u2019s origins. Bitcoin has grown to an unimaginable degree since Satoshi Nakamoto first disappeared, and the question of his true identity may seem totally sidelined next to the billions of inflows for the new Bitcoin ETFs or other decidedly 2024 market factors. The early days of Bitcoin still clearly hold sway over our community, however, and this trial has created an opportunity for enthusiasts to scrutinize and debate a wealth of new material from Satoshi. The question, then, is less \u201cwho is Satoshi Nakamoto\u201d and more \u201cwhere did Bitcoin come from\u201d? Understanding Bitcoin\u2019s humble origins is very important for understanding its bright future, after all. Even if the world of Bitcoin has been irrevocably transformed by new acceptance from the financial establishment, there are still fundamentals to remember. Bitcoin will always be decentralized, and it will always be a currency. Our goals are not merely to make speculative investments and gain fiat currency, but to radically upset the world of fiat altogether. As long as we can keep our eye on the ball, there\u2019s no telling how far Bitcoin can progress.","article_summary":"UK Courts firmly reject Craig Wright\u2019s claim of being Satoshi.

Four case studies below will illustrate how by combining Roth IRAs with bitcoin, you can save for retirement, optimize for your personal tax situation during retirement, and leave your bitcoin for the next generation. These are hypothetical case studies based on our experiences, not real people. They\u2019re intended to help you better understand how bitcoin Roth IRAs can fit into many types of retirement plans. Hence, they\u2019re for educational purposes\u2014you should discuss all personal situations with a financial, tax, or legal expert. Sally the super stacker: Saving for retirement Rod is retirement ready: Entering retirement Larry wants to leave a legacy: Inheritance \u201cWhy Would I?\u201d Wayne: Reasons not to Roth 1. Sally the super stacker: Saving for retirement Sally is in her early 30s and has fallen down the bitcoin rabbit hole. Sally views bitcoin as the best savings technology given today\u2019s current macroeconomic backdrop and bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply of 21 million and is committed to a disciplined accumulation strategy. She\u2019s looking for a way to save her hard-earned money without suffering debasement over time. Ultimately, she would like to use her savings for major goals: a dream vacation, a house, starting a family, and maybe retiring someday. But retirement is a distant goal, and she thinks the United States could go through some significant changes before she\u2019s ready to settle down. Why would she even bother with the fiat-based American retirement system? The rules, limits, penalties, and potential changes aren\u2019t worth it. Just keep your head down and stack sats, right? Not so fast, Sally. Importance of tax-free growth Like most bitcoiners, Sally is stacking bitcoin with money that has already been taxed. Her payroll taxes are withheld on payday, and she is paid the remaining U.S. dollars into her bank account. She then sends money to an exchange and purchases bitcoin. This is the typical way most people stack sats\u2014post-tax. However, just because the bitcoin is purchased post-tax does not mean it won\u2019t be taxed again. Non-retirement bitcoin earnings are taxed as a capital gain when sold. Over her years of stacking, she will need to keep track of her cost basis and deduct that amount from the gross proceeds when selling. It\u2019s a simple formula: (final trade) minus (what you paid) equals (what you made). What you make is taxed as capital gains. Enter the Roth IRA This is where a Roth IRA savings vehicle adds value. If Sally were to contribute to a bitcoin Roth IRA, contributions would still be made post-tax\u2014same as before. But the key difference is that qualified Roth IRA distributions are tax-free. She only pays tax once, not twice. The potential implications of tax-free bitcoin are massive. If the dollar value of bitcoin exponentially increases as Sally expects, then reducing her potential tax burden becomes increasingly rewarding. Let\u2019s assume she starts saving $6,000 per year at age 30 until she reaches age 65, and bitcoin grows at 6% annualized (feel free to plug in your own assumptions). At age 65, she will have accumulated $822,330. And if she had to pay an estimated 20% capital gains tax, it would amount to a bill over $117,000. In this scenario, a Roth IRA saves her more than $117,000. The Roth becomes a vehicle to supercharge future purchasing power without changing her current taxation. Not having to pay tax on future gains has an exponential impact over time. Get $100 off Unchained IRA and receive 1-year free of Bitcoin Magazine Pro market research ($250 value).

Not just retirement: Withdrawing contributions Four years into maximizing her bitcoin Roth IRA contributions, Sally has contributed $24,000 (four years of $6,000 max) and experienced a rapid increase in bitcoin price\u2014a common experience for many bitcoiners. Let\u2019s assume a hypothetical balance of $100,000. To celebrate and reward herself, she has planned a Miami vacation. However, she can\u2019t decide if she should sell her non-retirement bitcoin and pay gains tax or take it from her retirement account and pay penalties. With penalty-free access to Roth contributions, Sally can take up to $24,000 (her total contributions) out of her Roth without incurring penalty or tax. In this imaginary scenario, let\u2019s say she ends up pulling $10,000 from the Roth for her Miami vacation. More ways to maximize a Roth If Sally meets someone in Miami, she could pull $10,000 more from the Roth for an elopement wedding. And the house with the picket fence? The Roth allows for some flexibility in that, too: Roth IRAs allow for up to $10,000 of earnings to be withdrawn penalty-free if used for a first-time home purchase. With $4,000 of contributions left and an additional $10,000 in earnings for the first-time home purchase, Sally could combine forces with her equally-wise new spouse\u2014who was also contributing to a Roth\u2014and compile $24,000 for a down payment. After the tax- and penalty-free spending spree has subsided, she and her spouse can continue to regularly contribute again, saving for the next big goal, and ultimately for retirement. Key takeaways The Roth account has more flexibility than just saving for the classic age 59 ½ retirement scenario. Tax-free growth is a powerful tool to grow wealth over time and should be strongly considered for any retirement plan. You can pull contributions tax- and penalty-free at any time, and earnings are tax-free at retirement age. Certain conditions even allow you to pull earnings from your Roth without a penalty. 2. Rod is retirement ready: Entering retirement Rod has been diligently preparing for retirement. He\u2019s mentally there, but financially not ready to take the leap. Still, bitcoin has become an increasingly important position in his portfolio. What started as a hedge (1-2%) has become a core component (+10%). He holds some bitcoin directly but has more exposure through bitcoin-adjacent assets (GBTC, MicroStrategy, mining stocks, etc.). He\u2019s not ready to go all-in on bitcoin because, although he believes in its importance, the volatility conflicts with his desire for financial stability during retirement. He has worked hard to earn his nest egg and would hate for it to disappear\u2014especially to taxes. Within the next 5-10 years, he will transition out of his career and live off his 401k, investment account, real estate equity/income, and bitcoin. Any social security or pension are just a bonus. Brackets and buckets Rod needs to dive into his financial situation and see how his tax brackets will look. What will they look like the Monday morning after he retires? What will they look like after the pension or social security start? What about when the 401k required minimum distributions start at age 72? Knowing where the money is coming from, when it occurs, and how it\u2019s taxed are critical components to retiring\u2014and staying retired. To make a plan, Rod needs to think about each account type as being in a different \u201ctax bucket\u201d. His taxable assets are taxed upon sale, and his tax-deferred accounts are taxed when he takes income from them. The Roth provides another bucket: tax-free income. If Rod were to add a Roth IRA, he could pull from different buckets depending on the plan and the need. For example, Rod can pull from the Roth in high tax years and keep his bracket from climbing too quickly. He can pull from taxable or Traditional IRAs in low tax years and accelerate that income at a lower marginal rate. More sophisticated strategies could include conversions, delaying income, gifting taxable assets, etc. The key point: Roth allows for diversification in \u201ctax buckets\u201d to optimize your tax bracket in retirement. When Rod adds this tax-free bucket to his picture, he decides to fill it with high risk/reward assets like bitcoin. If the growth is tax-free, then it makes sense for it to grow as much as possible. He decides to sell his mining stocks, GBTC, and MSTR and convert that cash into a bitcoin IRA (preferably one where he controls access to the keys). Key takeaways What did your bracket look like this year? No, not the March Madness one. The un-fun IRS one. All retirees must consider their expected tax bracket throughout retirement, and tax bracket management is a science and an art. Specifics vary from person to person, but the main concept applies: The more diversified your \u201ctax buckets,\u201d the more flexibility and optionality you will have in any tax environment. 3. Larry wants to leave a legacy: Inheritance Larry has been enjoying his time with his wife and grandchildren. He had a successful career and profitable investments that have sustained his lifestyle through retirement. Now, he thinks much more about the next generation and the challenges and struggles they will face. He wants to protect those he cares about and leave the world a better place. At first, bitcoin didn\u2019t make sense to him. He thought it was just another get-rich-quick scheme. But given the state of the world today and institutional financial foolishness taking place, he\u2019s now open to seeing its long-term potential. Larry\u2019s main goal is to leave bitcoin for the kids and grandkids. He thinks it could become meaningful for their future when he\u2019s no longer with them. Inheritance and estate considerations When Larry sets up a Roth IRA, he does not ever have to take Required Minimum Distributions from that account. He can leave the assets there to grow tax-free for the long term\u2014perfect for bitcoin. Larry can easily add or modify beneficiaries to that IRA at any time, and beneficiaries will receive the Roth income tax-free upon his passing. He can accomplish his goal of passing bitcoin to his loved ones. (Estate taxes may still apply, Roth IRAs only avoid income tax.) Converting to a Roth IRA Larry was already retired when the Roth IRA came out in 1997, so he doesn\u2019t have an existing Roth, and you need earned income to contribute. But even though he can\u2019t add money directly to one, he can consider a Roth conversion. He can take pre-tax 401k/IRA funds and convert them to Roth, allowing him to pay the tax now and turn it into a tax-free vehicle for future generations. As to whether this is a good idea for your beneficiaries, the math is fairly simple: if you expect your tax rate to be lower than your beneficiaries\u2019 tax rate, then the Roth would make more sense. Source: When A Roth IRA May Actually Be A Terrible Asset To Inherit (Kitces) Key takeaways Larry has optionality. If the math makes sense, he could turn a portion of his portfolio into a bitcoin Roth IRA and leave the asset for future generations. It\u2019s worth noting that holding your own keys in an Unchained IRA requires that you also do proper inheritance planning. 4. \u201cWhy Would I?\u201d Wayne: Reasons not to Roth Wayne is in his peak earning years and making really good money at his fiat job. He lives a simple life enjoying a lot of time outdoors, and expects not to need much income after he retires. He has many hobbies, one of which is mining bitcoin with a few machines from his home. It\u2019s not a large-scale operation, just a hobby, but he would consider mining bitcoin with his retirement account if that were an option. Ultimately, he plans to leave all assets he owns to charities that he cares about. Brackets and buckets pt. 2 Revisiting the brackets and buckets discussion from above, Wayne\u2019s current income (high bracket) is much greater than his expected future income needs (low bracket). If he were to convert any of his existing retirement assets to Roth, he would be paying a higher rate than if he had just waited to pull it in retirement. From this perspective, it may be wiser to keep the assets in a Traditional pre-tax account and not convert to Roth. Death and taxes\u2026 You know the saying: nothing is certain in life but death and taxes. If that\u2019s true, we can certainly add \u201cdeath taxes\u201d to the list. \u201cDeath tax\u201d probably wasn\u2019t too popular in opinion research studies, so \u201cestate tax\u201d is the politically correct term these days. In 2022, the estate tax kicks in around $12 million of net worth ($24 million for married couples). Over time, more and more bitcoiners will need to consider this threshold as it becomes relevant to their situation. As Wayne considers a Roth IRA, he should note Roth IRAs do not avoid the estate tax, only the income tax. Wayne plans to leave all assets to charity. Assets left to qualified non-profit entities would avoid both estate and income tax. In his case, there is no benefit to the Roth over his current structure from a taxation-at-death standpoint. If it goes to charity, it avoids the death tax\u2014a silver lining to say the least. Mining in a Roth? Now, let\u2019s re-introduce Wayne\u2019s bitcoin mining hobby. Mining bitcoin within an IRA is technically possible but highly advised against for the average investor. He should be aware of the tax nightmare often involved and consult a tax advisor regarding UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax) within IRA accounts. Additionally, if Wayne wants to hold his mined bitcoin without revealing personal information to a financial institution, Roth IRAs simply aren\u2019t an option. Key takeaways When considering a financial strategy, no single tool works for every individual\u2019s situation. Factors such as tax bracket, net worth, and charitable intent are all relevant considerations when evaluating a Roth IRA. Mining doesn\u2019t tend to be well-suited for bitcoin IRAs because of UBIT. Due to these factors, a Roth IRA may not be the right route for Wayne. Upgrade your Bitcoin security and get access to exclusive discounts on Unchained financial services.

If a wallet has a single component that\u2014when lost or stolen\u2014can lead to a permanent loss of funds, then it\u2019s simply too dangerous to consider. Nobody wants to keep significant wealth teetering on the edge of catastrophe. Individual bitcoin holders have numerous tools available that can help reduce the risk of loss or theft. In a previous article, we covered some of these tools, highlighting modifications commonly applied to singlesig wallets. However, we also explained why these approaches fall short of removing single points of failure entirely. For a business, government, or other institution that wants to secure a bitcoin treasury, eliminating single points of failure is not just a nice-to-have, but a prerequisite. The only custody models worth considering for these entities are ones that include a threshold requirement in order to access funds. A threshold requirement describes a structure that involves multiple, separately secured components, where a subset of those components are needed to approve any withdrawal. This is the only way of achieving institutional-grade security, with single points of failure eliminated completely. In this article, we\u2019ll cover how to apply threshold security using three different methods: script multisig, Shamir\u2019s secret sharing (SSS), and multi-party computation (MPC). We\u2019ll also dive into the tradeoffs associated with each approach, and how an institution can choose the best setup to meet their needs.

If you aren\u2019t sure what script multisig is, we recommend checking out our earlier article dedicated to explaining how multisig wallets work and what they\u2019re used for. As a quick review, a multisignature wallet involves multiple private keys, and can be configured so that a specific number (threshold) of those private keys are required to sign any transaction. The signatures can be produced at different times and locations, allowing each key to remain physically separated. Once a threshold number of signatures have been produced, they can be combined into a single bitcoin transaction capable of spending the funds. A 2-of-3 script multisig quorum, where a threshold of two unique signatures from two keys are required for withdrawals. This relatively simple way of creating a threshold requirement is highly effective at removing all single points of failure. As long as the spending threshold is greater than one but less than the total number of keys, then any single key can become lost, stolen or destroyed without bitcoin becoming unrecoverable. The remaining keys could sign a recovery transaction moving funds to a fresh multisig setup. Satoshi Nakamoto laid the groundwork for multisig when bitcoin was first released, anticipating that it could be a popular mechanism for securing funds. However, it wasn\u2019t until the P2SH softfork in 2012 that multisig started to become a widely used tool. Multisig has since proven itself as a battle-tested security model for more than a decade, across several different address types. What is Shamir\u2019s secret sharing? Shamir\u2019s secret sharing (SSS) is a secret sharing algorithm that was developed by renowned cryptographer Adi Shamir in 1979. It can be used as another way of introducing a threshold requirement for protecting bitcoin. SSS allows users to split a key into several distributed \u201cshares,\u201d with only a certain threshold of the shares needed to reassemble the key. This can be used to design quorums like 2-of-3 or 3-of-5, similar to multisig. A 2-of-3 SSS arrangement, where any two shares, represented by the colored shapes, can reassemble the key to a singlesig wallet. The key can produce the single signature needed to withdraw funds. However, this approach still leads to single points of failure at certain instances during its lifecycle. One example is when the key is initially split up into SSS shares. This operation is usually done on a single device at a single time and place. If an attacker compromises that device, the key generation process or the share creation process, they\u2019ve compromised the key. Another example is whenever the user needs to reassemble the key to sign a transaction. A threshold number of shares must be brought together, once again on a single device at a single time and place, which an attacker could exploit. A fairly simple and widely used method of implementing SSS technology for cryptocurrency custody is through the Shamir backup, developed by Satoshi Labs in 2017. It can be found as an option in certain Trezor hardware wallet models.

MPC, or multi-party computation, is a subfield of cryptography that traces back to the 1970s. The goal of MPC is to allow multiple participants to jointly perform a computation, while each participant\u2019s contribution to the computation is not revealed to the rest of the group and therefore can remain private. This allows for multiple parties to collaborate in various contexts without needing to trust each other. When applied to bitcoin custody, MPC involves distributed \u201cshares,\u201d similar to SSS. However, unlike SSS, the shares are not split from a private key nor used to rebuild a private key. Instead, multiple parties compute a single signature directly from a threshold of their shares. A 2-of-3 MPC arrangement, where any two shares, represented by the colored shapes, can produce a signature directly without assembling a key first. Unlike SSS, MPC does not necessitate a single point of failure. MPC shares can be generated separately from one another, and they never need to be brought together to operate the wallet. Information produced from a share can be communicated to the other participants, without the share itself being revealed. Since bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have primarily used a signature system based on ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), MPC had to be adapted for this context. The first practical threshold protocols for ECDSA were published in 2018. [GG18, LNR18] What are the trade-offs between threshold models? With three different threshold security models to choose from, the next step is understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each option. Tradeoffs with multisig Script multisig is a standardized way of achieving threshold security, native to the bitcoin protocol. The structure is considered relatively simple and robust. The barrier to entry is also small\u2014if a bitcoin user knows how to operate a singlesig wallet, then it\u2019s not a large leap to learn how to set up and use a multisig wallet. When a multisig wallet is initialized, the addresses produced for receiving bitcoin into the wallet have the threshold requirement built into them. Once a multisig address has been funded, the bitcoin is protected by an immutable contract that has essentially been written into the blockchain itself. The only way to alter the contract (such as changing the access control policy, adjusting which keys are protecting the bitcoin) is to move the bitcoin to a new address that was built with a different contract. For multiple parties who are collaborating to secure bitcoin, this ground-level immutable contract mechanism can provide the highest degree of reassurance that the money is secured according to how all parties have intended. If anything were to be fundamentally changed, it would become obvious to everyone by the occurrence of a public transaction, and the keys that approved the change would be known. This is why collaborative custody providers such as Unchained rely on script multisig for our products. However, deploying contracts publicly on the blockchain comes with tradeoffs. As bitcoin is spent out of a multisig address, the access control policy for that address must be permanently published on the blockchain. Observers can then see the details of the multisig quorum that was being used. Although the remaining funds can be easily migrated to a new address going forward, the fact that past security arrangements are exposed isn\u2019t ideal. Additionally, needing to move bitcoin from one address to another in order to adjust the access control policy means that transaction fees are always involved with the process (and the larger the quorum, the more expensive it will be). For entities that value custodying altcoins, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, script multisig can pose more of a challenge than the other two methods of threshold security. This is because a multisig threshold quorum is imposed on the blockchain level, and different cryptocurrencies use different blockchains. Many cryptocurrencies don\u2019t even support a native, robust multisig implementation at all. Meanwhile, SSS and MPC enforce threshold quorums at the key level, and look like singlesig transactions publicly. Since almost all cryptocurrencies support a similar standard for singlesig custody (the same key can be used across most cryptocurrencies), this allows SSS and MPC to be more cross-chain compatible. Tradeoffs with Shamir\u2019s secret sharing SSS offers another way of designing a threshold requirement based on relatively simple and battle-tested cryptography. For the purposes of cryptocurrency custody, SSS also has a widely deployed method with a low barrier to entry (Shamir backup). Once someone has experience using a conventional singlesig wallet, it isn\u2019t a huge leap to use a Trezor to set up a wallet with a Shamir backup. Unlike multisig, SSS operates completely outside of public-facing addresses and transactions on the blockchain. Instead, the threshold requirement is decided by how the private key is split into shares. This means that splitting a key into shares and later reassembling them can be done in private, so that only the people participating in the bitcoin custody arrangement are aware that SSS is being used. In addition to privacy advantages, keeping the threshold structure outside of the blockchain also means that SSS transactions won\u2019t lead to increased fees, and it can be used to secure many different cryptocurrencies. Although most cryptocurrencies have their own unique blockchains, they can all share the same private key as an access point, and that key can in turn be split up using SSS. The biggest disadvantage to SSS has already been mentioned above\u2014the private key must exist in one place at one time, before it is first split into shares, and also when the shares are recombined for the purposes of approving a withdrawal. These vulnerabilities create temporary single points of failure, meaning that SSS by itself doesn\u2019t offer truly institutional-grade security, unlike multisig or MPC. Additionally, SSS doesn\u2019t natively offer a method for adjusting the access control policy. Once a private key is split into a quorum of shares, those shares will always maintain the ability to reproduce that key. If a group is securing a treasury together using SSS and a member of the group leaves, revoking permissions for that individual in a secure manner can pose a challenge. Remaining members of the group could reassemble the key and then split it into new shares, but the old shares would need to be verifiably destroyed. Otherwise, the funds would need to be sent to an entirely new wallet protected by a different key. Tradeoffs with MPC Much like SSS, MPC enforces the threshold requirement at the key-level instead of the blockchain-level. This unlocks similar advantages, such as granting a higher capacity for privacy, avoiding increased transaction fees, and allowing for one MPC custody structure to be used across many different cryptocurrencies. Importantly, MPC manages to avoid the temporary single points of failure that come with using SSS. By using a different cryptographic method, the key shares can exist separately from the moment the wallet is first created, and even remain separate while signing withdrawal transactions. Most MPC implementations also include a native method of adjusting the access control policy (creating a new quorum of shares) without having to send funds to a new wallet address. However, MPC for threshold ECDSA is considered very complex cryptography, and there is not an agreed-upon standard for using it. There are many different protocols, with the first two being developed independently in 2018 by Gennaro and Goldfeder [GG18] and Lindell et al. [LNR18]. Since then, we\u2019ve also seen protocols from Doerner et al. [DKLs19], Castagnos et al. [CCL+20], Damgård et al. [DJM+20], Canetti et al. [CMP20], Gągol et al. [GKSS20], Gennaro and Goldfeder [GG20], Canetti et al. [CGG+21], Abram et al. [ANO+21], Doerner et al. [DKLs23], and perhaps others. While the newer protocols tend to make certain improvements upon the older ones, they may have had less opportunity for peer-review, audit, and other testing. The higher level of complexity involved with MPC creates a widened attack surface. With additional components and procedures, there is more room for error and potential security vulnerabilities. Evidence of serious security flaws, including full private key extraction attacks, has already presented itself more than once, affecting some of the threshold ECDSA protocols listed above. Examples include: AS20 vulnerabilities, September 2020, affecting GG18 implementations Alpha-Rays vulnerabilities, December 2021, affecting GG18 and GG20 TSSHOCK vulnerabilities, August 2023, affecting GG18, GG20, and CGG+21 BitForge vulnerabilities, August 2023, affecting GG18 and GG20 \u201cCryptography needs to pass the test of time to attain longevity, and these new protocols clearly didn\u2019t pass the test of time[\u2026] this research was not ready for implementation or widespread adoption. From my perspective, implementing and productizing such recent research is quite dangerous.\u201d \u2014 Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet, December 2021 response to Alpha-Rays \u200d\u201c[MPC is] more complicated, more to get wrong. Advanced crypto protocols are fragile in the detail and in the implementation. I'd feel more confident in multisig, which is super simple and rock solid.\u201d \u2014 Post by renowned cryptographer Adam Back, January 2023 MPC is also limited by who can realistically use it in the first place. As previously mentioned, threshold ECDSA is very complicated. For the average individual, there are no tools available to safely or easily set up MPC independently. While some businesses offer collaborative custody MPC wallets that are fairly easy to use, those businesses offer no easy way for users to recover funds if the business disappears (or no way at all, in which case they are a single point of failure). Because script multisig is a simple and open standard, businesses who provide collaborative custody solutions using multisig can offer open-source and easy-to-use recovery tools. This creates a straightforward avenue for clients to recover their funds even if the collaborative multisig business were no longer available to assist. Which model is best? As we just covered, there are numerous tradeoffs between using multisig, SSS, and MPC. They can be arranged in a chart for a visual comparison: This chart demonstrates the strengths (blue) and weaknesses (red) for each method of implementing threshold security. Gray could be a strength or weakness depending on one\u2019s perspective. If a business specializes in the custody of many different cryptocurrencies, they might be motivated to hire a team of professionals to carefully set up an MPC custody model. However, if a business or individual were looking for a simple and reliable way to secure bitcoin for the long term, using script multisig and accepting the privacy tradeoffs might be preferable. SSS is rarely used by itself due to its inability to enforce institutional-grade threshold requirements at all times. Combining models for collaborative custody While multisig, SSS, and MPC are often thought of as competing security models, it\u2019s possible to incorporate more than one of them into an overall custody structure. As previously described, SSS and MPC allow a threshold of key shares to produce a signature for a transaction. If the signature was for spending funds out of a singlesig wallet, then nothing else would be required to complete the transaction. However, if instead the signature was for spending funds out of a multisig wallet, additional signatures from other keys could also be needed. A 2-of-3 multisig structure, where one possible signature could be produced from a normal key, another possible signature could be produced from a key that is reassembled from 2-of-3 SSS shares, and another possible signature could be produced directly from 2-of-3 MPC shares. While this combination of techniques may sound unnecessary and cumbersome, there are indeed some contexts where it makes practical sense. With the rise in popularity of key agents and multi-institution custody, there is a growing number of specialty businesses that are commissioned by individuals and institutions to secure one of the keys to a multisig wallet. These distributed key agents can help reduce custodial risk. But how should a key agent secure that single key which they are responsible for? SSS or MPC can be a strategy to minimize or remove single points of failure from this duty. A corporate key agent can design a system where several different officers within the business each hold key shares, and therefore a signature can only be produced upon agreement from a threshold of those officers. Additionally, if an attack were to occur during an SSS reassembly, or an MPC implementation ends up suffering from a new key extraction vulnerability like the ones listed earlier, then no customer funds are immediately at risk. The key agent would have time to react and address the issue, while the bitcoin remains protected by the broader multisig wallet. Using script multisig to create a threshold requirement as a foundational immutable contract, and then commissioning professional key agents to each protect a multisig key using their own SSS or MPC threshold, is far and away the safest method for an institution to keep bitcoin secured for the long-term. New capabilities with Taproot In November of 2021, the Taproot soft-fork occurred, adding new tools into the bitcoin ecosystem. Some of these tools impact the future of institutional-grade bitcoin custody, by allowing for certain improvements and optionalities. Schnorr signatures: The Schnorr signature algorithm is now available in bitcoin as an alternative to ECDSA. Using MPC on top of Schnorr leads to threshold security schemes that are far less complicated, and therefore also provide higher confidence in their security, compared to the ECDSA protocols mentioned earlier. FROST is the leading Schnorr threshold signature protocol, while MuSig2 is also available specifically for N-of-N quorums. Both of these signature schemes are on the path to becoming standardized tools across the bitcoin industry, and they are expected to make MPC available for regular individuals, with a user experience similar to script multisig. Script type privacy: Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) addresses are a new address type that allow script multisig bitcoin addresses to appear identical to the addresses being used for singlesig wallets. This provides a significant privacy improvement, because it means that the bitcoin address itself doesn\u2019t provide any clues about its owner\u2019s security model, such as whether or not they might be using script multisig. Multiple spending paths: P2TR addresses also have the ability to contain multiple spending paths built into them. This can create new ways of structuring threshold security for institutional-grade custody, as described in BIP 342 (rationale, section 5). For example, a user could create an N-of-N script multisig spending path for every combination of keys that can spend funds. Rather than build a 2-of-3 quorum with keys A, B, and C, a similar outcome can be achieved with three separate 2-of-2 quorums as possible spending paths\u2014one with keys A and B, one with keys A and C, and one with keys B and C. This strategy can increase privacy, because only the spending path that ends up getting used will be revealed. A similar concept can be applied to MPC key share quorums, allowing MuSig2 to be utilized for thresholds. These Taproot tools are relatively new, and their adoption is still in the early stages. Many bitcoin softwares and services don\u2019t yet offer full support for what Taproot has to offer. It\u2019s also worth noting that most altcoins don\u2019t have these tools natively available. Final thoughts A growing number of institutions are becoming interested in securing a bitcoin treasury, and they require effective solutions. Avoiding single points of failure and minimizing counterparty risk are paramount considerations. The best way to meet these criteria is by leveraging a multisig structure, where keys can be distributed among various enterprise key agents, none of whom will have unilateral control over the bitcoin. Each key agent can use SSS or MPC to add extra threshold protection for their particular key. Unchained has pioneered an enterprise custody network, built for institutional clients who want to set up an arrangement like this. It\u2019s easy to use and customizable, so that each client gets to choose whether they\u2019d like to hold a controlling number of keys themselves, or just a single key, or leave the responsibility of securing keys entirely up to the several, independent enterprise key agents.

Ordinals have been a polarizing phenomenon for most every subcommunity in Bitcoin \u2014 except for miners. The meteoric rise of the new Bitcoin-native NFT standard dominated discourse for months as Ordinals flooded blockspace and buoyed transaction fees to multiyear highs. According to critics, these transactions are, at worst, an attack on Bitcoin that tainted the sanctity of scarce blockspace; at best, they are shitcoins, the play-things of gamblers that belong on casino chains like Ethereum. Well, miners don\u2019t give a shit if they\u2019re shitcoins. They give a shit about making money, and Ordinals gave them a revenue boost at a time when mining income was at one of its lowest points ever. So many miners have embraced \u2014 or at the least, are ambivalent about \u2014 Ordinals/inscriptions, since they received a much-needed boost to Bitcoin mining profitability when many miners were nearly breakeven or unprofitable. Hashprice is a measure of the USD (or BTC) amount miners can expect to earn from a unit of hashrate (for example, at $80/PH/day, a miner with 1 petahash of mining rigs \u2014 roughly 10 new-gen ASICs like the S19j Pro, for example \u2014 can earn $80 per day). Given their positive impact on hashprice, Ordinals, a darkhorse technical advancement that few could have predicted last year, have found themselves at the center of discussions regarding Bitcoin mining economics, discussions that are more germane with each block that pulls us closer to Bitcoin\u2019s fourth block subsidy halving. Click the image above to subscribe! I\u2019m not writing this to proselytize anyone into becoming an Ordinals enjoooyer. I, for one, don\u2019t really understand the appeal. But I do think that they\u2019re important in the context of Bitcoin\u2019s ever-dwindling block subsidy, so they\u2019re worth studying to understand how they affect blockspace and mining economics \u2014 and what developments like them might mean in a future where miners subsist solely on transaction fees. WTF is an Ordinal, Anyway? In NFT parlance, folks use Ordinal and inscription interchangeably, but the individual terms refer to two different aspects of the NFT standard. An inscription is a piece of art or digital media, while an Ordinal is technically the number prescribed to an inscription to mark its place in the grand scheme of all other inscriptions. Another way to view it is that the inscription itself is the NFT, while the Ordinal is the number used to identify an individual inscription. The data for each inscription lives in the Segregated Witness section of a transaction. As such, unlike other NFT standards, the actual art, digital media, or data is uploaded directly to Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain. Since the inscriptions are fully on-chain, you could argue that they are the purest form of NFT available as they benefit from the blockchain\u2019s immutability. Not All Inscriptions Are Created Equal When you understand that inscriptions are actual on-chain data, you can appreciate some of the critiques and concerns from detractors; if a bunch of NFT degens are inscribing monkey JPEGs and dickbutts and God-knows-what-else on-chain, then this crowds out economic (and potentially necessary) transactions. This concern was aggravated by the fact that the arbitrary data for each inscription benefits from a transaction fee discount. As a scalability measure, Bitcoin\u2019s Segregated Witness upgrade modified the transaction structure so that the witness data for a private key signature and public key was moved from the transaction hash field to another part of the block. Bitcoin discounts SegWit data, so it requires fewer satoshis per byte in transaction fees to transact. The arbitrary data for an inscription lives in the SegWit field of a transaction, so it\u2019s entitled to the SegWit discount. Cue the pitchforks. This discount is why, despite the first wave of image-based inscriptions clogging block space in February/March/April, transaction fees did not meaningfully increase; block sizes swelled when trendsetting inscribers flushed the blockchain with thousands of JPEGs for the first inscriptions collections, but these all benefited from SegWit\u2019s 4-to-1 data discount versus normal transactions. Perhaps intuitively, it wasn\u2019t until less data-heavy, text-based inscriptions from BRC-20 tokens became the most popular inscription type that transaction fees soared. So-called BRC-20s (a nod to Ethereum\u2019s own ERC-20 token standard) are a loose form of token. I say loose because they are really just Ordinals in a series defined by Bitcoin\u2019s OP_CODE function, where each \u201ctoken\u201d is itself an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token\u2019s place in the specific BRC-20 series. It goes like this: Someone (God only knows who) publishes an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token series\u2019 max supply, ticker, and the minting limit per transaction. Once publicized, anyone with the technical know-how can mint tokens in the series. These OP_CODE transactions do not benefit from SegWit\u2019s data discount, so they cost a pretty penny more than image-based inscriptions. But they also have a feature that image inscriptions don\u2019t: the minting function, which brings Ethereum NFT-esque incentives to collecting these inscriptions. Ethereum NFT series typically have minting contracts where anyone can create new NFTs in the series by interacting with the contract. This is part of \u2014 if not the entire \u2014 appeal. Minting an NFT is like opening up a digital pack of Pokémon/baseball/Magic: The Gathering cards \u2014 maybe there\u2019s a rare card in this next one! And while there isn\u2019t necessarily the opportunity to mint a rare BRC-20 (because they are all the same), there\u2019s the chance to mint a bunch of NFTs in a hot new series. Why anyone cares about having ORDI/CUMY/RATS #1 or #100 or whatever, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps it\u2019s the greatest expression of the greater fool theory yet in Bitcoin. But the fact is, they do, and the minting incentives for BRC-20s precipitated the largest wave of Bitcoin transaction activity ever. Through a combination of fee wars and the fact that these NFTs don\u2019t benefit from the SegWit discount, BRC-20s have catered a veritable fee feast for Bitcoin miners, but not exactly in the way you might think. Quantifying Transaction Fee Collateral Damage The bulk of transaction fee increases in 2023 has not come directly from fees associated with Ordinals; it has come from indirect fee pressure on other transactions. Per data from independent analyst Data Always\u2019 Dune dashboard, as of November 12, 2023, miners have raked in $70.3 million fees from Ordinals. Seems bigly, but it\u2019s only 19.4% of the $368.2 million in transaction fees that miners have earned in total since inscriptions debuted on December 14, 2022. To put this into further perspective, there have been 40.2 million inscription transactions, which equates to 30% of all transaction volume since December 14. So inscriptions have accounted for one-third of transaction volume over the last year but only one-fifth of all fees. As for the other fees, many of them are the result of indirect fee pressure from inscriptions \u2014 that is, fees that do not come directly from inscriptions themselves, but from the pressure that inscriptions exert on the average transaction fee needed to clear a Bitcoin transaction in a reasonable time frame. Galaxy Digital Research examines this dynamic in a report titled \u201cBitcoin Inscriptions & Ordinals: A Maturing Ecosystem\u201d. Rampant inscription activity congests the mempool. This is particularly true during BRC-20 minting events, as the first-come-first-mint incentivizes bidding wars as inscribers gun to be the first to mint a series. This raises the floor for average transaction fees and, as Galaxy Digital Research points out, precipitates transaction fee \u201coverpayment\u201d from various transactors. They define overpayment as any fee in a block that is greater than that block\u2019s median transaction fee. For normal transactions, this overpayment could come from transaction fee estimators in wallets or on exchanges or from general user ignorance regarding transaction fee structure and dynamics. Some users may also need to expedite transactions for any number of reasons, leading to overpayment. For inscription transactions, Galaxy Digital Research says that \u201cvoluntary overpayment\u201d was commonplace during times of high activity and popular inscription mints. This chart quantifies overpayment for inscription transactions and all other transactions to demonstrate the dynamics Galaxy Digital Research outlines in their report. When Bitcoin\u2019s mempool became backlogged in April and May \u2014 the hottest time frame for inscription activity so far \u2014 a majority of the transaction fees during this time actually came from user overpayment for financial transactions, not inscriptions themselves. These users could probably make it easier on themselves by not using built-in transaction fee estimators with their wallets and exchanges. Blessing and a Curse Inscriptions are a blessing and a curse. They\u2019re a godsend for miners, but they can be a pain in the ass for other Bitcoiners, particularly those who have to send transactions on the network every day. That said, blockspace is an open market. So I don\u2019t have to like Ordinals to recognize that it\u2019s not my place to police someone else\u2019s spending. Nor is it my place to censor a transaction that pays for blockspace on the f(r)ee market. That\u2019s part of the point of a permissionless blockchain, after all: to make transactions other people don\u2019t want you to make.

The translated points would go something like this: If you own bitcoin early and it becomes a globally valuable money, you gain immensely. 😀 If you own bitcoin and it fails, you\u2019ve lost that value. 😢 If you don\u2019t own bitcoin and it goes to zero, no pain and no gain. 😐 If you don\u2019t own bitcoin and it succeeds, you will have missed out on the significant financial revolution of our lifetimes and fall comparatively behind. 😡 If bitcoin is successful, it will be worth far more than it is today and have a massive impact on your financial future. If it fails, the losses are only limited to your exposure. The most that you could lose is the money that you invested. It is hypothetically possible that bitcoin could be worth 100x more than it is today, but it can only possibly lose 1x its value as it goes to zero. The concept we\u2019re discussing here is asymmetric upside - significant gains with relatively limited downside. In other words, the potential rewards of the investment outweigh the potential risks. Bitcoin offers an asymmetric upside that makes it a wise investment for most portfolios. Even a small allocation provides potential protection against extreme currency debasement. Salt, gasoline, and insurance \u201cDon\u2019t over salt your steak, pour too much gas on the fire, or buy too much insurance.\u201d A little bit goes a long way, and you can easily overdo it. The same applies when looking at bitcoin in the context of a financial plan. Bitcoin\u2019s asymmetric upside gives it \u201cinsurance-like\u201d qualities, and that insurance pays off very well in times of money printing. This was exemplified in 2020 when bitcoin's value increased over 300% in response to pandemic money printing, far outpacing stocks, gold, and bonds. Bitcoin offers a similar asymmetric upside today. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it resistant to inflationary debasement. In contrast, the dollar's purchasing power consistently declines through unrestrained money printing. History has shown that societies prefer money that is hard to inflate. If recent rampant inflation is uncontainable and the dollar system falters, bitcoin is well-positioned as a successor. This global monetary A/B test is still early, but given their respective sizes, a little bitcoin can go a long way. If it succeeds, early adopters will benefit enormously compared to latecomers. Of course, there are no guarantees, but the potential reward justifies reasonable exposure despite the risks. Let\u2019s imagine Nervous Nancy, an extremely conservative investor. She wants to invest but also take the least risk possible. She invests 100% of her money in short-term cash equivalents (short-term treasuries, money markets, CDs, maybe some cash in the coffee can). With this investment allocation, she\u2019s nearly certain to get her initial investment back and receive a modest amount of interest as a gain. However, she has no guarantees that the investment returned to her will purchase the same amount as it used to. Inflation and money printing cause each dollar to be able to purchase less and less over time. Depending on the severity of the inflation, it might not buy anything at all. In other words, she didn\u2019t lose any dollars, but the dollar lost purchasing power. Now, let\u2019s salt her portfolio with bitcoin. 99% short-term treasuries. 1% bitcoin. With a 1% allocation, if bitcoin goes to zero overnight, she\u2019ll have only lost a penny on the dollar, and her treasury interest will quickly fill the gap. Not at all catastrophic to her financial future. However, if the hypothetical hyperinflationary scenario from above plays out and bitcoin grows 100x in purchasing power, she\u2019s saved everything. Metaphorically, her entire dollar house burned down, and \u201cbitcoin insurance\u201d made her whole. Powerful. A little bitcoin salt goes a long way. (When protecting against the existing system, it\u2019s important to remember that you need to get your bitcoin out of the system. Keeping bitcoin on an exchange or with a counterparty will do you no good if that entity fails. If you view bitcoin as insurance, it\u2019s essential to keep your bitcoin in cold storage and hold your keys. Otherwise, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s insurance.) When all you have a hammer, everything looks like a\u2026 A construction joke: There are only three rules to construction: 1.) Always use the right tool for the job! 2.) A hammer is always the right tool! 3.) Anything can be a hammer! Yeah. That\u2019s what I thought, too. Slightly funny and mostly useless. But if you spend enough time swinging a hammer, you\u2019ll eventually realize it can be more than it first appears. Not everything is a nail. A hammer can tear down walls, break concrete, tap objects into place, and wiggle other things out. A hammer can create and destroy; it builds tall towers and humbles novice fingers. The use cases expand with the skill of the carpenter. Like hammers, bitcoin is a monetary tool. And a 1-5% allocator to the asset typically sees a \u201cspeculative insurance\u201d use case - valid. Bitcoin is speculative insurance, but it is not only speculative insurance. People invest and save in bitcoin for many different reasons. I\u2019ve seen people use bitcoin to pursue all of the following use cases: Hedging against a financial collapse (speculative insurance) Saving for family and future (long-term general savings and safety net) Growing a downpayment for a house (medium-term specific savings) Shooting for the moon in a manner equivalent to winning the lottery (gambling) Opting out of government-run, bank-controlled financial systems (financial optionality) Making a quick buck (short-term trading) Escaping a hostile country (wealth evacuation) Locking away wealth that can\u2019t be confiscated (wealth preservation) As a means to influence opinions and gain followers (social status) Fix the money and fix the world (mission and purpose) Keep this in mind when taking other people\u2019s financial advice. They are often playing a different game than you. They have different goals, upbringings, worldviews, family dynamics, and circumstances. Even though they might use the same hammer as you, it could be for a completely different job. Wrapping Up A massive allocation to bitcoin may seem crazy to some people, yet perfectly reasonable to others. The same goes for having a 1% allocation. But, given today\u2019s macroeconomic environment and bitcoin\u2019s trajectory, I find very few use cases where 0% bitcoin makes sense. By not owning bitcoin, you implicitly say that you are 100% certain it will fail and go to zero. Given its 14-year history so far, I\u2019d recommend reducing your confidence. Nobody is 100% right forever. A little salt goes a long way. Your financial plan may be riskier without bitcoin. Diversify accordingly. \u201cWe must learn our limits. We are all something, but none of us are everything.\u201d - Blaise Pascal. Contact Office: (208)-254-0142 408 South Eagle Rd.

By receiving an official blessing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an institutional investing barrier has been lifted. With this barrier gone, financial advisors, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies and retail investors can now receive Bitcoin exposure without hassling with direct custodianship. More importantly, a taint has been scrubbed off from Bitcoin, previously likened to \u201ctulip mania\u201d, \u201crat poison\u201d, or \u201cindex of money laundering\u201d. Following the unprecedented domino of crypto bankruptcies throughout 2022, Bitcoin price reverted to November 2020 level of $15.7k by the end of that year. After that great FUD reservoir was drained, Bitcoin slowly recovered during 2023 and entered 2024 at $45k level, first visited in February 2021. With the 4th Bitcoin halving ahead in April, and with ETFs setting new market dynamics, what should Bitcoin investors expect next? To determine that, one must understand how Bitcoin ETFs elevated BTC trading volume, effectively stabilizing Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility. Understanding Bitcoin ETFs and Market Dynamics Bitcoin itself represents the democratization of money. Not beholden to central authority like the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized network of miners and algorithmically determined monetary policy ensures that its limited 21 million coin supply can\u2019t be tampered with. For BTC investors, this means they can be exposed to an asset that is not on an inherent trajectory of devaluation, which is in stark contrast to all existing fiat currencies in the world. This is the foundation for Bitcoin\u2019s perception of value. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) present another democratization pathway. The purpose of ETFs is to track an asset\u2019s price, represented by shares, and enable trading throughout the day unlike actively managed mutual funds. The ETFs\u2019 passive price tracking ensures lower fees, making it an accessible investment vehicle. Of course, it would be up to Bitcoin custodians like Coinbase to enact sufficient cloud security to instill investor confidence. In the ETF universe, Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated high demand for a decentralized asset that is resistant to centralized dilution. Altogether in the last 15 days, they have resulted in $29.3 billion trading volume against $14.9 billion pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC (GBTC). Image credit: Bloomberg Intelligence via James Seyffart This is not surprising. As Bitcoin price moved up due to Bitcoin ETF hype, 88% of all Bitcoin holders entered the profit zone in December 2023, eventually reaching 90% in February. In turn, GBTC investors were cashing out, placing a downward pressure worth $5.6 billion on Bitcoin price. Moreover, GBTC investors took advantage of lower fees from the newly approved Bitcoin ETFs, shifting funds from GBTC\u2019s relatively high 1.50% fee. At the end of the day, BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the volume winner at 0.12% fee, which will go up to 0.25% after a 12-month waiver period. To place this in the context of the wider ETF universe, IBIT and FBTC managed to outpace iShares Climate Conscious & Transition MSCI USA ETF (USCL), launched in June 2023, within a month of trading. Image credit: Bloomberg Intelligence via Eric Balchunas This is particularly indicative given that Bitcoin\u2019s history is one of attacks coming from the sustainability direction. It bears reminding that Bitcoin price fell 12%, in May 2021, shortly after Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla no longer accepts BTC payments precisely due to eco concerns. During January, IBIT and FBTC found themselves at 8th and 10th place respectively as ETFs with the largest net asset inflows, headed by iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to Morning Star report. With daily ~10,000 BTC streaming into ETFs, this represents a greatly lopsided demand over ~900 BTC mined per day. Moving forward, as the GBTC outflow pressure wanes and inflow trend increases, the steady stream of funds into Bitcoin ETFs is poised to stabilize BTC price. The Mechanism of Stabilization With 90% of Bitcoin holders entering the profit zone, highest since October 2021, selloff pressures can come from many sources, institutional, miner and retail. The higher inflow trend in Bitcoin ETFs is the bulwark against it, especially heading into another hype event - 4th Bitcoin halving. Higher trading volumes generate higher liquidity, smoothing out price movements. That\u2019s because larger volumes between both buyers and sellers absorb temporary imbalances. During January, CoinShares\u2019 report showed $1.4 billion of Bitcoin inflows, together with $7.2 billion from newly issued US-based funds, against the GBTC outflows of $5.6 billion. At $1.4 billion, Bitcoin represents 96% of total flows in the US. Image credit: CoinShares In the meantime, large financial institutions are setting new liquidity baselines. As of February 6th, Fidelity Canada set up 1% Bitcoin allocation within its All-in-One Conservative ETF Fund. Given its \u201cconservative\u201d moniker, this signals even greater percentage allocations in future non-conservative funds. Ultimately, if Bitcoin taps into 1% of the $749.2 trillion market pool of various asset classes, Bitcoin\u2019s market cap could grow to $7.4 trillion, bringing Bitcoin price to $400k. Bitcoin\u2019s current market cap is within $0.85 - $0.9 billion range. Image credit: Blockware Solutions Given that Bitcoin ETFs provide a consistent and transparent market price reference point, large aggregated trades reduce market impact on potential selloffs coming from miners. This is visible from FalconX Research, showing a great uptick in daily aggregate volumes, previously from average 5% heading into the 10 - 13% range. In other words, the new Bitcoin ETF-induced market regime is reducing overall market volatility. So far, Bitcoin miners have been the main price-suppressing driver on the other side of the liquidity equation. In Bitfinex\u2019s latest weekly on-chain report, miner wallets were responsible for 10,200 BTC in outflows. This matches the aforementioned ~10,000 BTC inflows in Bitcoin ETFs, resulting in relatively stable price levels. As miners reinvest and upgrade mining rigs ahead of the 4th halving, another stabilizing mechanism could come into play - options. Although the SEC is yet to approve options on spot-traded BTC ETFs, this development will further expand ETF liquidity. After all, the greater spectrum of investing strategies revolving around hedging increases liquidity on both sides of the trade. As a forward-looking metric, implied volatility in options trading gauges market sentiment. But the greater market maturity that we will inevitably see following the introduction of BTC ETFs, we\u2019re more likely to see a more stabilized pricing of options and derivative contracts in general. Analyzing Inflows and Market Sentiment As of February 9th, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) holds 468,786 BTC. Over the last week, the BTC price went up 8.6% to $46.2k. Concurrent with the previous forecast, this means that BTC dumping is likely to spread out over multiple rallies ahead of the 4th halving and beyond. By latest numbers provided by Farside Investors, as of February 8th, Bitcoin ETFs have racked up $403 million inflows, totaling to $2.1 billion. GBTC outflows totaled $6.3 billion. Image credit: Farside Investors From January 11th to February 8th, GBTC outflows have steadily decreased. Within the first week, they averaged $492 million. In the second week, GBTC outflows averaged $313 million, ending in $115 million on average during the third week. Source: Farside Investors, image credit: Bitcoin Magazine On a weekly basis, this represents a 36% reduction on sell pressure from week one to two, and 63% reduction from week two to three. As GBTC FUD unfolded up to February 9th, crypto fear & greed index elevated to \u201cgreed\u201d at 72 points. This represents a revisit to January 12th, at 71 points, just a few days after Bitcoin ETF approvals. Looking ahead, it bears noticing that Bitcoin price is reliant on global liquidity. After all, it was the Fed\u2019s interest rate hiking cycle in March 2022 that caused the avalanche of crypto bankruptcies, culminating in the FTX collapse. Current fed fund futures project the end of that cycle either in May or in June. Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that the Federal Reserve will veer off the money printing course. And at such occasions, Bitcoin price followed suit. M2 money supply measures how much money is available in an economy. Image credit: LookIntoBitcoin.com Considering the insurmountable national debt of $34 trillion, while the federal spending keeps outpacing revenue, Bitcoin is positioning itself as a safe haven asset. One that waits for capital inflows into its limited 21 million coin supply. Historical Context and Future Implications As a similar safe haven asset, Gold Bullion Securities (GBS) launched as the first gold ETF in March 2003 on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Next year, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) launched on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Within a week from November 18th, 2004, GLD\u2019s total net assets rose up from $114,920,000 to $1,456,602,906. By the end of December, this decreased to $1,327,960,347. To reach BlackRock\u2019s IBIT market value of $3.5 billion, it took GLD up to November 22nd 2005. Although not inflation-adjusted, this indicates Bitcoin\u2019s superior market sentiment compared to gold. Bitcoin is digital, yet it is grounded in a proof-of-work mining network spanning the globe. Its digital nature translates to portability which can not be said of gold. The USG showcased this point when President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102 in 1933 for citizens to sell their gold bullions. Likewise, new gold veins are frequently discovered which dampens its limited supply status in contrast to Bitcoin. In addition to these fundamentals, Bitcoin ETF options are yet to materialize. Nonetheless, Standard Chartered analysts project $50 to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Moreover, large companies are yet to follow MicroStrategy\u2019s lead by effectively converting shares sales into a depreciating asset. Even 1% BTC allocations across mutual funds are poised to skyrocket BTC price. Case in point, Advisors Preferred Trust set up a 15% range allocation into indirect Bitcoin exposure via futures contracts and BTC ETFs. Conclusion After 15 years of doubt and aspersions, Bitcoin has reached the apex of credibility. The first wave of believers in sound money ensured that the blockchain version of it is not lost in the bin of coding history. On the back of their confidence, up until now, Bitcoin investors constituted the second wave. The Bitcoin ETF milestone represents the third wave exposure milestone. Central banks around the world continue to erode confidence in money, as governments cannot help themselves but to indulge in spending. With so much noise introduced into the exchange of value, Bitcoin represents a return to the sound money root. Its saving grace is digital, but also physical proof-of-work as energy. Barring extreme USG action to sabotage institutional exposure, Bitcoin could even overtake gold as a traditional safe haven asset. This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.

However, COPA rejected the offer, emphasizing that it would imply acceptance of Wright's self-proclaimed identity as Satoshi Nakamoto.

In a recent interview, Back explained his bullish perspective on Bitcoin's potential. \"I think it's kind of overdue already,\" he said about Bitcoin reaching a six-figure valuation. \"Bitcoin has been performing quite well, and many new applications like Strike have come online, providing easy user interfaces. The fundamentals and price have diverged somewhat, so I think the price will catch up.\" Back doubled down on his $100,000 prediction in a post on X saying, \"I think the reason things are muted is that $100k seems way overdue, for a few years now. There's not much bull market euphoria as the $1-5k green candles scroll by. Just tick tock $100k.\" Back's comments come after Bitcoin rallied in 2023 following a brutal bitcoin winter in 2022. The approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January has since reignited interest in the asset class. The British cryptographer is one of the most respected veterans in the space, making his bullish price prediction noteworthy.

When talking about fiat currencies, debasement traditionally refers to the practice of reducing the precious metal content in coins while keeping their nominal value the same, thereby diluting the coin\u2019s intrinsic worth. In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency \u2014 such as when central banks increase the supply of money, in the process lowering the nominal value of each unit. UNDERSTANDING DEBASEMENT Before paper money and coins made of cheap metals like nickel, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver. These were the most sought after metals of the time, giving them value beyond government decree. Debasement was a common practice to save on precious metals and use them in a mix of lower-value metals instead. This practice of mixing the precious metals with a lower-quality metal means authorities could create additional coins with the same face value, expanding the money supply for a fraction of the cost compared to coins with more gold and silver content. Today, coins and notes don't have inherent worth, they are simply tokens that represent value. This means debasement relies on supply: i.e. how many coins or notes the issuing body allows to circulate. Debasement went through different processes and methods over time; therefore, we can define old and new methods. TRADITIONAL METHOD Coin clipping, sweating, and plugging were the most common debasement processes used until the introduction of paper money. Such methods were employed both by malicious actors that counterfeited coins and by authorities that increased the number of coins in circulation. Clipping involves \u201cshaving\u201d the coins\u2019 edges to remove some of the metal. As with sweating, the resulting clipped bits would be collected and used to make new counterfeit coins. Sweating involves shaking coins vigorously in a bag until the edges of the coins come off and lay at the bottom. The pieces are then collected and used to create new coins. Plugging was a way of punching a hole out of the coin\u2019s middle area with the rest of the coin hammered together to close the gap. It could also be sawn in half with a plug of metal extracted from the interior. After filling the hole with a cheaper metal, the two halves would be fused again. MODERN-DAY METHODS Money supply increase is the modern method used by governments to debase the currency. By printing more money, governments get more funds to spend but it results in inflation for its citizens. Currency can be debased by increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, or implementing other measures that encourage inflation; they\u2019re all \u201cgood\u201d ways of reducing the value of a currency. WHY IS MONEY DEBASED? Governments debase their currency so that they can spend without raising further taxes. Debasing money to fund wars was an effective way of increasing the money supply to engage in expensive conflicts without affecting people\u2019s finances \u2014 or so it is believed. Whether by traditional debasement or modern money printing, money supply increases have short-sighted benefits in boosting the economy. But in the long term, it leads to inflation and financial crises. The effects of this are felt most acutely by those in society who do not own hard assets that might counter the loss in the currency\u2019s value. Currency debasement could also occur by malicious actors who introduce counterfeit coins to an economy, but the consequence of being caught can in some countries lead to a death sentence. \u201cInflation is legal counterfeiting, Counterfeiting is illegal inflation.\u201d - Robert Breedlove Governments can take some measures to mitigate risks associated with money debasement and prevent unstable and weak economies, for example by controlling the money supply and interest rates within a specific range, managing spending, and avoiding excessive borrowing. Any economic reform that promotes productivity and attracts foreign investments helps maintain confidence in the currency and prevent money debasement. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES The Roman Empire The first example of currency debasement dates back to the Roman Empire under emperor Nero around 60 A.D. Nero reduced the silver content in the denarius coins from 100% to 90% during his tenure. Emperor Vespasian and his son Titus had enormous expenditures via post-civil war reconstruction projects like the building of the Colosseum, compensation to the victims of the Vesuvius eruption, and the Great Fire of Rome in 64 A.D. The chosen means to survive the financial crisis was to reduce the silver content of the \u201cdenarius\u201d from 94% to 90%. Titus\u2019 brother and successor, Domitian, saw enough value in \u201chard money\u201d and the stability of a credible money supply that he increased the silver content of the denarius back to 98% \u2014 a decision he had to revert when another war broke out, and inflation was looming again across the empire. This process gradually continued until the silver content measured just 5% in the following centuries. The Empire began to experience severe financial crises and inflation as the money continued to be devalued \u2014 particularly during the 3rd century A.D., sometimes referred to as the \u201cCrisis of the Third Century.\u201d During this period, spanning from about A.D. 235 to A.D. 284, Romans demanded higher wages and an increase in the price of the goods they were selling to face currency depreciation. The era was marked by political instability, external pressures from barbarian invasions, and internal issues such as economic decline and plague. It was only when Emperor Diocletian and later Constantine took various measures, including introducing new coinage and implementing price controls, that the Roman economy began to stabilize. However, these events highlighted the vulnerabilities of the once-mighty Roman economic system. Read More >> Hard To Soft Money: The Hyperinflation Of The Roman Empire OTTOMAN EMPIRE During the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman official monetary unit, the akçe, was a silver coin that went through consistent debasement from 0.85 grams contained in a coin in the 15th century down to 0.048 grams in the 19th century. The measure to lower the intrinsic value of the coinage was taken to make more coins and increase the money supply. New currencies, the kuruş in 1688 and then the lira in 1844, gradually replaced the original official akçe due to its continuous debasement. HENRY VIII Under Henry VIII, England needed more money, so his chancellor started to debase the coins using cheaper metals like copper in the mix to make more coins for a more affordable cost. At the end of his reign, the silver content of the coins went down from 92.5% to only 25% as a way to make more money and fund the heavy military expenses the current European war was demanding. WEIMAR REPUBLIC During the Weimar Republic of the 1920s, the German government met its war and post-war financial obligations by printing more money. The measure reduced the mark\u2019s value from around eight marks per dollar to 184. By 1922, the mark had depreciated to 7,350, eventually collapsing in a painful hyperinflation when it reached 4.2 trillion marks per USD. History offers us poignant reminders of the perils of monetary expansion. These once-powerful empires all serve as cautionary tales for the modern fiat system. As these empires expanded their money supply, devaluing their currencies, they were, in many ways, like the proverbial lobster in boiling water. The temperature \u2014 or in this case, the rate of monetary debasement \u2014 increased so gradually that they failed to recognize the impending danger until it was too late. Just as a lobster doesn't appear to realize it\u2019s being boiled alive if the water\u2019s temperature rises slowly, these empires didn\u2019t grasp the full extent of their economic vulnerabilities until their systems became untenable. The gradual erosion of their monetary value was not just an economic issue; it was a symptom of deeper systemic problems, signaling the waning strength of once-mighty empires. DEBASEMENT IN THE MODERN ERA The dissolution of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s marked a pivotal moment in global economic history. Established in the mid-20th century, the Bretton Woods system had loosely tethered major world currencies to the U.S. dollar, which itself was backed by gold, ensuring a degree of economic stability and predictability. However, its dissolution effectively untethered money from its golden roots. This shift granted central bankers and politicians greater flexibility and discretion in monetary policy, allowing for more aggressive interventions in economies. While this newfound freedom offered tools to address short-term economic challenges, it also opened the door to misuse and a gradual weakening of the economy. In the wake of this monumental change, the US has experienced significant alterations in its monetary policy and money supply. By 2023, the monetary base had surged to 5.6 trillion dollars, representing an approximate 69-fold growth from its level of 81.2 billion dollars in 1971. As we reflect on the modern era and the significant changes in U.S. monetary policy, it\u2019s crucial to heed these historical lessons. Continuous debasement and unchecked monetary expansion can only go on for so long before the system reaches a breaking point. EFFECTS OF DEBASEMENT Currency debasement can have several significant effects on an economy, varying in magnitude depending on the extent of debasement and the underlying economic conditions. Here are some of the most impactful consequences that currency debasement can generate over the long term. Higher inflation rates Higher inflation rates are the most immediate and impactful effects of currency debasement. As the currency\u2019s value decreases, it takes more units to purchase the same goods and services, eroding the purchasing power of money. Increasing Interest Rates Central banks may respond to currency debasement and rising inflation by increasing interest rates, which can impact borrowing costs, business investments, and consumer spending patterns. Deteriorating the Value of Savings Currency debasement can deteriorate the value of savings held in the domestic currency. This is particularly detrimental to individuals with fixed-income assets, such as retirees who rely on pensions or interest income. More Expensive Imports A debased currency can make imports more expensive, potentially leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers reliant on foreign goods. However, it may also make exports more competitive internationally, as foreign buyers can purchase domestic goods at a lower price. Undermining Public Confidence in the Economy Continuous currency debasement can undermine public confidence in the domestic currency and the government\u2019s ability to manage the economy effectively. This loss of trust may further exacerbate economic instability and even hyperinflation. SOLUTION TO DEBASEMENT The solution to debasement lies in the reintroduction of sound money \u2014 money whose supply cannot be easily manipulated. While many nostalgically yearn for a return to the gold standard, which was arguably superior to contemporary systems, it is not the ultimate solution. The reason lies in the centralization of gold by central banks. Should we revert to a gold standard, history would likely repeat itself, leading to confiscation and the debasement of currencies once again. Put simply, if a currency can be debased, it will be. How Bitcoin Avoids Debasement Bitcoin offers a permanent solution to this issue. Its supply is capped at 21 million, a number that is hard-coded and safeguarded by proof-of-work mining and a decentralized network of nodes. Thanks to its decentralized nature, no single entity or government can control Bitcoin\u2019s issuance or governance. Furthermore, its inherent scarcity makes it resilient to the inflationary pressures that are typically seen with traditional fiat currencies. As a distributed system, Bitcoin users can ensure that the supply never deviates from the predetermined supply cap by running the software that downloads and validates the entire transactional ledger. By verifying every transaction in Bitcoin\u2019s history, where every coin came from and where it went, users can be absolutely sure that the supply has not been debased and no coins were created that should not have been. Full node software like this for Bitcoin is essentially a counterfeiting detection machine that anyone can run. It guarantees the supply is intact, that coins being spent were properly authorized, and no funny business is happening. Any Bitcoin wallet software can also ensure that no one can restrict your access to your own money. In times of economic uncertainty, or when central banks engage in extensive money printing, investors often turn to assets like gold and bitcoin for their store-of-value properties. As time progresses, there\u2019s potential for people to recognize Bitcoin not just as a store of value, but as the next evolution of money.","article_summary":"Bitcoin has been touted as the solution to monetary debasement, but what is debasement really, and where does it come from?

Using only the first four letters of the BIP39 seed words, a 12-word seed phrase can be stored in a mere 48 nucleotides of DNA. (For comparison, the average gene is several thousand nucleotides long, and the complete human genome contains over 3 billion nucleotides). Any genetics graduate student could, in just a few days, turn my seed word sequence into an actual strand of DNA and insert that DNA into E. coli or some other suitable host for storage (and propagation) inside a living organism. DNA is just one modality for storing and transmitting information. There are numerous other ways to do so and once information is widely distributed it is nearly impossible to extinguish, which is why it will be impossible to stop Bitcoin on a global scale with regulation, legislation, or even violence. The mere fact that you can store a bitcoin private key in DNA demonstrates the futility of attempting to ban Bitcoin. Once unleashed, information is hard to contain. But why is information so hard to contain? Perhaps because information is a fundamental entity of the universe. For centuries scientists thought the universe was made only of matter and energy. Today, we know it is made of matter, energy, and information. Information can be stored in matter and transmitted using energy, but information itself is neither. Einstein showed us that matter and energy are interchangeable (E=mc2) but in toto cannot be created nor destroyed. By contrast, information can be created and destroyed, but neither is easy. And once information is created and widely distributed, it is increasingly difficult to destroy. The Parts of Information Information is meant to be sent and received between two or more parties. It is done with a purpose by the sender and is meant to spur action in the receiver. There are five hierarchical components to information: Fidelity Syntax (code or grammar) Semantics (meaning) Pragmatics (action) Apobetics (purpose) Fidelity Fidelity is the lowest element of information, but it is absolutely necessary for successful transmission. It was once a major issue for cell phone and internet communication. Remember the \u201cCan you hear me now?\u201d commercial? With technical advancements, low fidelity eventually became high fidelity (which weirdly became wireless fidelity, or Wi-Fi). Generally, we are not concerned with fidelity unless it is lacking. (Can you hear me now?) The Code and Language Syntax refers to the code or grammar used for transmitting information. A code is a set of symbols that represent temporally or spatially interconnectable bits of information. That is, symbols can be strung together in time or space to achieve the next level of information (semantics). The symbols used can vary tremendously. They include, among other things, the letters that make up an alphabet, hand gestures (e.g., American Sign Language), musical notes (e.g., those old modem connections and touch tone phones), or the nucleotides in DNA and RNA. The number of symbols used can vary, as well. Most alphabets use 20-35 letters, the nucleotide code uses four chemicals (abbreviated A, U, C, and G), and the binary code employed by computers has just two symbols (0 and 1) representing the on and off states. The number and type of symbols employed are not selected randomly. For instance, they may be determined by the mode of transmission or to meet a specific need (Table 1). Table 1: Symbols may be chosen for mode of transmission or to meet a specific need. A common code is essential for information to be successfully communicated. That is, the code must be known to both the sender and the receiver. Also, because the code is not itself the information but merely the purveyor of information, any particular code can be translated to any other code. For example, written human languages can be translated from one to another: Go tell it on the mountain\u2026 Va le dire sur la montagne\u2026 Ve a contario en la montaña\u2026 The above phrase can also be translated, using human eyes, brain, and mouth, from symbols on a page into sound waves (acoustic symbols) in the air, which can be picked up by a microphone and converted to electrical signals in wires and then to radio waves transmitted through space to be picked up by an antenna on the space station, turned back into electrical signals, and then converted by a speaker back into sound waves to be heard by the ears of another human. In the ears of our human astronaut, the signal is converted from waves of air to waves of fluid in the cochlea and then to electrical nerve impulses carried to the brain to be interpreted by neurons. In the brain, those neurons somehow make sense of the original string of symbols, which brings us to the next level of information: semantics or meaning. Semantics, Pragmatics, and Apobetics Semantics is the meaning or intent of a message (a string of symbols). The allocation of meaning to symbols is a mental process. This doesn\u2019t happen at the machine level but at the human level. When you read a book, you are not interested in fidelity (unless it is lacking) or syntax (unless the grammar is horrible or it\u2019s a language you do not understand). Instead, you are interested in the meaning conveyed by the message, i.e., the semantics. Although computers can store and transmit information with ease, and can even perform logic operations via transistors, they cannot meaningfully interpret information the way a human can. Do raspberry pi nodes, hardware wallets, or ASICs understand Bitcoin the way a human does? I think not. The aim of meaningful communication is to prompt some action in the recipient. This aim for action represents the pragmatic level of information. The reason the sender wishes to prompt this response is the purpose of the information, which is the apobetic level of information. These highest levels of information require genuine intelligence on both parties, even a will. Whether or not computers can ever possess a will remains to be seen. \u201cGo tell it on the mountain\u2026\u201d is a string of symbols (code) that create a meaningful message (semantics) with the sender expecting (apobetics) some response from the receiver (pragmatics). The message can only be received if transmitted adequately (good fidelity). Bitcoin as Information Bitcoin (the program) is computer code written in a particular coding language. From the software to the blockchain to the key pairs of wallets, bitcoin is information. This information can be stored, transmitted, and replicated in flash drives, printed books, or DNA molecules. Because it is now so widely dispersed, it is virtually impossible at this point to destroy. Politicians and bankers may not like it, but the genie is out of the bottle and cannot be stopped now. As they say, you cannot ban Bitcoin, you can only ban yourself from using Bitcoin. Fidelity and syntax are the operational parts of information. Semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics are the higher levels of information concerned with the purpose and response of intelligent beings based on the meaning of the message. In Bitcoin, fidelity \u2013 or clarity of transmission \u2013 is achieved by the internet (and has even been accomplished by HAM radio) connecting a network of nodes, miners, and wallets. The syntax of Bitcoin consists of the coding languages used to write and execute Bitcoin Core and related software on those devices. The meaning, or semantics, of Bitcoin is a perfectly scarce, immutable, digital token. The highest purposes of Bitcoin \u2013 the pragmatics and apobetics \u2013 are demonstrated in the users that run miners, nodes, and wallets who are motivated and seeking to secure their wealth from theft, either by robbery or debasement. The internet is now a mature and high-fidelity communication system. It cannot be destroyed without simultaneously destroying humanity as we know it. The computer codes and languages utilized by Bitcoin are sufficiently distributed such that eliminating them is essentially impossible. But even if you could somehow destroy the fidelity and syntax of the network, the idea of Bitcoin \u2013 the semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics \u2013 is too widely distributed to defeat. At this point, it has found its way into the minds of millions of people around the globe. Perhaps you could destroy the internet and every last hard drive holding the blockchain and every last computer running Bitcoin, but you would have to hunt down every last Bitcoiner to eradicate the idea of Bitcoin. And who knows, due to the ungovernable actions of some mad scientist, you might have to hunt down all the E. coli, too. This is a guest post by Daniel Howell.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Bitcoin has had another period of intense and record-breaking success, spurred on both by positive developments in international business and by increasingly large commitments from the spheres of traditional finance. It\u2019s truly stunning how well Bitcoin has been performing throughout the first quarter of 2024. The year began with Bitcoin\u2019s valuation crossing the $40k mark, and March 1 saw a persistent hover around $60k. Now, however, Bitcoin has gone up to $72k, the highest valuation in its entire history. Although we still are not quite at the level where \u201cdigital gold\u201d is more valuable than gold itself, we have even reached a new milestone: by market cap, Bitcoin is currently a more valuable commodity than silver. Considering the immense role that silver has played in global currency for thousands of years, this is certainly a milestone to remember. This period of success has been especially noteworthy for the continued confidence it\u2019s been enjoying from some of the largest financial institutions in the world. On March 10, for example, it was reported that BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager and prominent issuer of the Bitcoin spot ETF, had finally acquired enough bitcoin that it surpassed even the holdings of MicroStrategy. Considering that its board chairman, Michael Saylor, is such a Bitcoin evangelist, this development seemed especially huge. It was an even bigger surprise, however, when Saylor announced that he was buying enough to reclaim its leading position the very next day. Less than 24 hours passed between this original announcement and MicroStrategy\u2019s purchase of 12k bitcoin, and this purchase took place when Bitcoin was already enjoying a price point over $70k. This purchase put MicroStrategy at the head of nearly every other private bitcoin stockpile, from all publicly traded miners to several major exchanges and ETF issuers. It\u2019s a stunning display of confidence in Bitcoin that anyone is prepared to make such major investments at a time when it\u2019s never been more expensive. It seems that the mood in these companies is that the all-time highs of today will seem like a paltry sum in just a few years. Analysts from ETF issuer Bitwise, for example, were confident enough in their prediction that corporate entities representing trillions of dollars would begin ramping up investments that Bitwise\u2019s Chief Investment Officer released an official memo on the subject. Claiming \u201cserious due diligence\u201d conversations with everyone from hedge funds to massive corporations, the memo predicts that Q2 will see even more massive inflows than the first three months of the year. This just leaves us with one question: Where does this kind of confidence come from? The center of the issue seems to be the runaway success of the Bitcoin ETF and, in particular, BlackRock\u2019s dominating position over the main issuers. Initially, it struggled with Grayscale, which had several natural advantages: it was a Bitcoin-native company with a massive stockpile, it was a real leader in the legal battle to actually get SEC approval, its GBTC was a previously-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, and it had other tricks up its sleeve. Nevertheless, BlackRock is the ETF that reached $10 billion faster than any other in history, shooting ahead of all other Bitcoin competitors and indeed all ETFs in general. Much of this revenue came from users fleeing GBTC\u2019s high fees, and it seems like a confident industry leader today. Its success has even matured to the international stage, as Mudrex, a crypto investment platform based in India, is opening up BlackRock ETF sales to institutional and private investors in a country with more than 1 billion people. This kind of success from BlackRock in particular has also led some of its competitors to change up their tactical approach. VanEck, for example, made an announcement on March 11 that they were waiving all fees on their Bitcoin ETF for an entire year. This will only continue so long as their VanEck Bitcoin Trust is under $1.5 billion, but the fees after this window will still be some of the lowest available. Grayscale, for its part, is also seeking to address the problem of high fees by spinning off a \u201cmini-version\u201d of its ETF, offering fractions of Bitcoin for a fraction of GBTC\u2019s fees. It seems that BlackRock\u2019s competitors are not yet willing to concede a market with such tremendous growth potential. However, although the ETF market has been especially hot lately, that is not the only reason to believe that Bitcoin\u2019s doing so well. ABC News, for example, credits some positive developments from the United Kingdom as a major factor in Bitcoin\u2019s price jump. Britain has previously been considered a particularly hostile regulatory environment for Bitcoin, especially the ETF, trailing behind both Western Europe and most of the Anglosphere in official Bitcoin approval. It was quite a surprise, then, when the London Stock Exchange (LSE) released a new factsheet on exchange-traded notes (ETNs), deciding that this type of financial instrument would be offered on their platform. ETNs do differ substantially from ETFs, even those like the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has no direct link to Bitcoin itself. ETNs are a type of debt security and do not even include the proviso that the issuer actually holds the bitcoin in question. Still, they are directly tied to the value of Bitcoin and offer investors a way to gain exposure to the world\u2019s leading digital asset. Considering that these ETNs are subject to the stringent rules that govern securities, it\u2019s particularly interesting that the LSE has suddenly changed its tune on Bitcoin-related financial products. In other words, it seems that the sea change in legal Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States has undeniably changed the calculus for businesses worldwide. With all these billions flowing into the Bitcoin ETF, even an unfriendly regulator like Great Britain must join in the bonanza if it wishes to maintain relevance as a leading hub of global finance. These are just a few of the developments that have occurred in the world of Bitcoin, as the intersection between decentralized currency and traditional finance has become both broader and deeper. Looking forward, there are still plenty of upcoming events, like the halving predicted in April, to keep propelling the hype forward. It may be difficult to predict exactly where the next major development and price jump will come from, but right now it looks as if there is a growing faith coming from some true financial giants. Bitcoin has come an incredibly long way since the days of its total pariah status, and now there\u2019s well over a trillion dollars in the market. With growth like that, it\u2019s an easy win to keep betting on Bitcoin.","article_summary":"Bitcoin tops out price records again between major ETF inflows and new offerings in the UK.

Spearheaded by Nexo, this global initiative is dedicated to securing an official Bitcoin emoji for digital keyboards everywhere, signaling a monumental step toward recognizing Bitcoin's multifaceted role in society as a revolutionary technology, a form of money, and a cultural phenomenon. \u201cBitcoin's journey reflects a remarkable blend of innovation and community,\u201d stated Kosta Kantchev, Co-founder & Executive Chairman of Nexo. \u201cIt's time its significance is recognized universally, starting with a symbol we all understand - an emoji. Join us in making history.\u201d The coalition comprises a diverse group of participants including prominent entities such as Bitcoin Magazine parent company BTC Inc, Bitget, Brink, Chainalysis, Hacken, Nansen, and Unstoppable Domains. Together, they aim to celebrate and advocate for Bitcoin's integration into the digital lexicon through the universal language of emojis. \u201cBitcoin is universal money for the world, it needs a universal emoji for every person, young and old to use,\u201d said BTC Inc CEO David Bailey. The campaign kicks off with a 50-day petition hosted on Change.org, culminating in an official submission to the Unicode Consortium within the 2024 submission window. This concerted effort marks a renewed push for recognition, building on previous attempts and highlighting the growing importance of Bitcoin in our daily lives. Emojis have evolved from their origins in Japan in the 1990s to become foundational elements of digital communication, transcending linguistic and geographical barriers. According to Unicode, 92% of internet users worldwide use emojis in their digital communications. The campaign for a Bitcoin emoji is more than symbolic\u2014it's a movement to cement Bitcoin's status as an essential component of modern digital and financial ecosystems worldwide. \u201cSupporting Bitcoin's development has always been about paving the way for future innovation. An official emoji is more than a symbol; it's a nod to Bitcoin's technological impact on the world,\u201d said Mike Schmidt, Executive Director of Brink.

This one: Ariel Aguilar and La Bitcoineta European Edition at BTC Prague. That car is the Bitcoineta European Edition, and the cheerful guy is Ariel Aguilar. Ariel is part of the European Bitcoineta team, and has previously driven another similar car in Argentina. In fact, there are currently five cars around the world that carry the name Bitcoineta (in some cases preceded with the Spanish definite article \u201cLa\u201d). Argentina: the original La Bitcoineta The story of Bitcoinetas begins with the birth of 'La Bitcoineta' in Argentina, back in 2017. Inspired by the vibrancy of the South American Bitcoin community, the original Bitcoineta was conceived after an annual Latin American Conference (Labitconf), where the visionaries behind it recognized a unique opportunity to promote Bitcoin education in remote areas. Armed with a bright orange Bitcoin-themed exterior and a mission to bridge the gap in financial literacy, La Bitcoineta embarked on a journey to bring awareness of Bitcoin's potential benefits to villages and towns that often remained untouched by mainstream financial education initiatives. Operated by a team of dedicated volunteers, it was more than just a car; it was a symbol of hope and empowerment for those living on the fringes of financial inclusion. The concept drawing for La Bitcoineta from December 2017. Ariel was part of that initial Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and spent weeks on the road when the car became a reality. The original dream to bring bitcoin education even to remote areas within Argentina and other South American countries came true, and the La Bitcoineta team took part in dozens of local bitcoin meetups in the subsequent years. The original La Bitcoineta from Argentina. One major hiccup came in late 2018, when the car was crashed into while parked in Puerto Madryn. The car was pretty much destroyed, but since the team was possessed by a honey badger spirit, nothing could stop them from keeping true to their mission. It is a testament to the determination and resilience of the Argentinian team that the car was quickly restored and returned on its orange-pilling quest soon after. Argentinian Bitcoineta after a major accident (no-one got hurt); the car was restored shortly after. Over the more than 5 years that the Argentinian Bitcoineta has been running, it has traveled more than 80,000 kilometers - and as we\u2019ll see further, it inspired multiple similar initiatives around the world. Follow La Bitcoineta\u2019s journey: Twitter: https://twitter.com/labitcoineta Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bitcoineta/ El Salvador: Bitcoin Beach In early 2021, the president of El Salvador passed the Bitcoin Law, making bitcoin legal tender in the country. The Labitconf team decided to celebrate this major step forward in bitcoin adoption by hosting the annual conference in San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador. And correspondingly, the Argentinian Bitcoineta team made plans for a bold 7000-kilometer road trip to visit the Bitcoin country with the iconic Bitcoin car. However, it proved to be impossible to cross so many borders separating Argentina and Salvador, since many governments were still imposing travel restrictions due to a Covid pandemic. So two weeks before the November event, the Labitconf team decided to fund a second Bitcoineta directly in El Salvador, as part of the Bitcoin Beach circular economy. Thus the second Bitcoineta was born. Salvadoran\u2019s Bitcoineta operates in the El Zonte region, where the Bitcoin Beach circular economy is located. The eye-catching Volkswagen minibus has been donated to the Bitcoin Beach team, which uses the car for the needs of its circular economy based in El Zonte. Follow Bitcoin Beach: Twitter: https://twitter.com/Bitcoinbeach South Africa: Bitcoin Ekasi Late 2021 saw one other major development in terms of grassroots bitcoin adoption. On the other side of the planet, in South Africa, Hermann Vivier initiated the Bitcoin Ekasi project. \u201cEkasi\u201d is a colloquial term for a township, and a township in the South African context is an underdeveloped urban area with a predominantly black population, a remnant of the segregationist apartheid regime. Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as an attempt to introduce bitcoin into the economy of the JCC Camp township located in Mossel Bay, and has gained a lot of success on that front. Bitcoin Ekasi was in large part inspired by the success of the Bitcoin Beach circular economy back in El Salvador, and the respect was mutual. The Bitcoin Beach team thus decided to pass on the favor they received from the Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and provided funds to Bitcoin Ekasi for them to build a Bitcoineta of their own.

Hermann Vivier is seen in the background. South African Bitcoineta serves the needs of Bitcoin Ekasi, a local bitcoin circular economy in the JCC Camp township. Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as a sister organization of Surfer Kids, a non-profit organization with a mission to empower marginalized youths through surfing. The Ekasi Bitcoineta thus partially serves as a means to get the kids to visit various surfer competitions in South Africa. A major highlight in this regard was when the kids got to meet Jordy Smith, one of the most successful South African surfers worldwide. Coincidentally, South African surfers present an intriguing demographic for understanding Bitcoin due to their unique circumstances and needs. To make it as a professional surfer, the athletes need to attend competitions abroad; but since South Africa has tight currency controls in place, it is often a headache to send money abroad for travel and competition expenses. The borderless nature of Bitcoin offers a solution to these constraints, providing surfers with an alternative means of moving funds across borders without any obstacles.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, subscribe now. Digital Currency Group, a venture capital firm, has filed a motion to dismiss a criminal suit filed against them by the New York Attorney General\u2019s office. The legal battle between DCG and the NYAG has been ongoing for several months, and is directly entangled with a dispute between two other prominent crypto firms: Genesis, a now-defunct brokerage firm, and Gemini, exchange and bank. These groups have been entangled in a series of disputes that trace back years, involving dramatic relationship changes and serious fraud accusations. A particularly relevant twist in the whole situation is the fact that the bankrupt Genesis is and has been a subsidiary of the substantially powerful DCG, which holds billions\u2019 worth of assets under management and counts ETF issuer Grayscale as another subsidiary. In other words, untangling the background for all the different players involved here is a fairly significant undertaking, especially considering the fraught environment that currently exists. Not only is the attorney general\u2019s suit directed against DCG, Genesis and Gemini in equal measure, but Genesis and Gemini have also faced off in civil suits independent of this. The NYAG accused these firms in October 2023 of collectively defrauding investors out of more than $1 billion, and the mutual recriminations involved have created a messy atmosphere. To begin, as good a place as any is a recent revelation found in court filings surrounding this dismissal. Specifically, court documents this March have made it public knowledge that Genesis and Gemini considered a merger in 2022. In 2022, DCG CEO Barry Silbert conducted a meeting with Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss over lunch, to discuss some of the motivations and logistical issues with merging the two corporate entities together. At the time, Genesis was in serious danger of bankruptcy, and its substantial partnerships with Gemini meant that the fallout would likely damage the other company\u2019s business. Gemini had lent substantial funds to Genesis as part of the Gemini Earn program, which Genesis had proceeded to lose. The hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was in charge of this money when it went belly-up in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, and Genesis was faced with a $1 billion dilemma. As for the original source of these lost funds, the NYAG has accused the firms of defrauding this money from investors. At the meeting, Silbert made the sales pitch that the two firms should combine, and that they \u201cwould be a juggernaut and would be competitive with Coinbase and FTX\u201d. He added that, even if Genesis and Gemini couldn\u2019t reach an agreement on these terms, \u201cthere is a ton more Gemini and Genesis can do together and the two companies should be leaning in together, not pulling apart\u201d. Although Winklevoss was allegedly \u201cintrigued\u201d by the proposed deal, it did not happen. Frictions, alongside Genesis\u2019 declaration of bankruptcy, arose in the immediate aftermath. A particular point of friction is found in the aforementioned Gemini Earn partnership, which made headlines this February when Genesis won a court ruling against Gemini. Essentially, Genesis owned a tranche of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares that were promised to Gemini as collateral for an exchange of money between the two companies, but Genesis declared bankruptcy before the shares could actually change hands. Since GBTC is unique among the Bitcoin spot ETFs as a pre-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, this tranche of shares had ballooned by early 2024 to be worth more than $1.2B. DCG\u2019s ownership of both Grayscale and Genesis put an extra complication over the issue. Gemini objected to Genesis\u2019 legal right to sell the shares it was promised years prior, and this began a lengthy civil suit. Although the issue was resolved through a series of settlements that allowed Genesis to make the sale and kept both it and Gemini from admitting culpability, the NYAG still filed a complaint alleging that the parties involved were all jointly guilty of substantial fraud. There were more than a billion dollars missing, and the attorney general\u2019s office was growing tired of the mutual recriminations between the relevant parties. Even if Genesis could make enough money from their sale to recoup their investors, that still doesn\u2019t address the issue of criminal activity. A particular illustration of the hostile environment came up when DCG, Genesis\u2019 parent company, disputed Genesis\u2019 own settlement with the NYAG. So, this brings us to the present day. On March 7, Silbert and DCG filed a motion to dismiss the attorney general\u2019s suit, claiming that the allegations against these companies were entirely baseless. In the motion, DCG\u2019s legal team claimed that \u201cThe allegations against DCG in this case are a thin web of baseless innuendo, blatant mischaracterizations and unsupported conclusory statements. In search of a headline-worthy scapegoat for losses caused by others, the OAG [Office of the Attorney General] wrongfully seeks to portray DCG\u2019s good-faith support of a subsidiary as participating in fraud\u201d. They specifically claim that DCG acted in good faith by funneling money towards Genesis after the Three Arrows collapse, investing \u201chundreds of millions of dollars of additional capital into its subsidiary during the months leading up to its bankruptcy, even though DCG had no obligation to do so\u201d. The attorney general took a different view, that DCG\u2019s net contributions conceal a large drain of Genesis\u2019 money at one crucial moment: DCG took their money back, Genesis declared a \u201cliquidity crunch\u201d and did not allow users to withdraw their crypto, Genesis went bankrupt immediately. The burden of proof is on them, however, to demonstrate that this was a deliberate fraud tactic. As of yet, there is no way of knowing what a judge will think of DCG\u2019s proposed defense or motion to dismiss, or if a settlement is feasible in the event that the motion to dismiss is denied. However, one unambiguously good sign has come out of the morass: Gemini announced its plans to fully reimburse the allegedly defrauded users of the Gemini Earn partnership with assets in kind. In other words, these users had Bitcoin stolen from them in 2022, and Gemini has made commitments to pay them back, accounting for Bitcoin\u2019s price jump since then. This has tacked on another $700M to the price tag of reimbursing over $1B in assets, and is a clear sign of confidence from the company. Source If nothing else, this decision to reimburse users like this is an impressive display of sincerity and good intentions from Gemini. Gemini is named as a co-defendant on all the legal documents submitted by Silbert\u2019s legal team about the NYAG suit, and would also benefit greatly from seeing the suit dismissed. This gesture of good faith might not be enough to clear the air for DCG and Genesis, but it certainly couldn\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s chances of escaping the whole fiasco without a criminal conviction. Although Gemini failed to halt Genesis\u2019 attempt at getting the money from GBTC sales, Gemini is still a successful and prominent exchange. Apparently, it was able to float a compensation of this size without relying on the GBTC tranche. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to how the suit will proceed in the coming months. When the NYAG first filed a complaint after the first round of settlements, it seemed clear that the prosecutors were quite fed up with the acerbic attitude of these former business partners. Nevertheless, Gemini\u2019s restitution plan will surely go a long way in proving their intention to do right by their users. If nothing else, it shows that they\u2019re proactive in taking the issue seriously. We\u2019ll have to observe the situation carefully as it develops, but it does seem clear that the mutual loathing and underhandedness displayed so far has not been rewarded. The broader digital asset space has periodically been filled with shaky businesses and outright scams, but eventually they all fall apart. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has come by its success legitimately.

In true Web3 tradition, the collection was launched by a seven-member $KARMA Council, bringing together 10 leading Ordinals communities behind $KARMA\u2019s mission. The $KARMA Council\u2019s airdrop aims to foster a sense of community amongst early Ordinals participants and bolster the burgeoning ecosystem. Strength in Numbers: Growing the Ordinals Ecosystem $KARMA is a token launched by a seven-member council, including four representatives from the OnChainMonkey (OCM) community: Soldman Gachs (@DrSoldmanGachs), Fitzy (@fitzyOG), Rabbi (@RabbiGains), and Drheref (@DrHeref). They are joined by BennyTheDev (@rarity_garden) and Alex Philippine (@Skrylabs) from Tap Protocol, bringing their technical expertise. Jason Fang (@JasonSoraVC) from Sora Ventures, a lead investor in Metagood, creators of OnChainMonkey, and the Tap Protocol is the final member of the Council. Fostering strong relationships with other communities is something that the $KARMA Council believes will be an essential step in achieving the $KARMA community\u2019s goals. Accordingly, a significant number of tokens have been earmarked for future \u2018Karmunity\u2019 Incentives. The $KARMA community incentive pot will continue to activate future partnerships or activations that will help to further expand the $KARMA and Ordinals community. This could include rewarding valuable community members, partnering with additional projects, or general growth initiatives. The Ordinals Community Airdrop With this in mind, the $KARMA Council decided to airdrop 49,968,900 $KARMA tokens to communities within the Ordinals ecosystem. This was designed to push towards $Karma Council\u2019s goal of expanding both the OCM & Ordinals ecosystems. The Council sought to take an objective selection process. For this initial airdrop, they selected the top 9 collections by market capitalization at the time of the snapshot at Block Height 828,888 (4 February 2024). The 9 communities eligible to receive $KARMA tokens in the Community Airdrop are: Bitmap (https://ordinalswallet.com/collection/bitmap) Bitcoin Punks (https://bitcoinpunks.com/) Bitcoin Puppets (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/bitcoin-puppets) Bitcoin Frogs (https://bitcoinfrogs.com/) Nodemonkes (https://nodemonkes.com/) OMB (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/omb) RSIC (https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/rsic) PIPE (https://trac.network/Pipe/) TRAC (https://trac.network/) Rewarding the OCM Community A total of 560 million $KARMA tokens are being allocated to holders of OnChainMonkey NFTs. Eligibility for the OnChainMonkey community was based on assets being migrated from Ethereum to Bitcoin. Except for the OCM Karma collection (https://opensea.io/collection/karma-monkey), which has had their allocation of $KARMA reserved until that collection is upgraded to Bitcoin. Since the snapshot has not been completed for OCM Karma, people can still purchase the assets on ETH and when they migrate to Bitcoin, they will be eligible for the $KARMA airdrop. \"Trac is the governance token for Tap Protocol, the first decentralized indexer economy on the Ordinals protocol enabling similar features of ERC20 but on Bitcoin L1. The TAP standard that created $KARMA was conducted by members of the OCM community but has now expanded towards 9 other Ordinals communities,\u201d Jason Fang, founder of Sora Ventures said. \u201cTap protocol contains many more features compared to BRC20 that enables developers and projects to stake, send cost effective airdrops, and enable token distributions that make building on Bitcoin most cost effective, safer, and scalable.\u201d \"$Karma embodies the spirit of innovation and community, serving as a beacon for the next generation of decentralized ecosystems. We're thrilled to champion this groundbreaking initiative led by our OnChainMonkey community members and investors,\" remarked Amanda Terry, co-founder and COO of Metagood. \"At OnChainMonkey, we\u2019re a community of builders and innovation and impact are woven into our DNA. Just as Bitcoin revolutionized finance, $Karma is poised to redefine collaboration, economic empowerment, and impact, with strong communities early to Ordinals at its core.\u201d Technical Milestones for Airdrops The airdrop of the $KARMA tokens was performed in an efficient manner utilizing \u201cTapping,\u201d a core feature of the TAP Protocol. \u201cTapping\u201d is a process of transacting that makes it considerably cheaper and faster to distribute tokens to a large amount of addresses. Using the existing BRC-20 standard, conducting an airdrop for 61,000 wallets would have required over 122,000 transactions. The KarmaCouncil was able to complete the entire airdrop using under 55 transactions, therefore setting a precedent for the future of community inclusions for future airdrops on Bitcoin. BRC20 requires 2 transactions for a single transfer of tokens between 2 parties. The TAP Protocol allows for many transfers within 2 transactions. 1 transaction with many receivers at once and a 2nd transaction to approve the transfers (called \"tapping\"). This reduces the costs for airdrops significantly in comparison to BRC20 as there is almost half of the transactions needed. It also helps to put the Bitcoin network under less stress due to lesser amounts of transactions required. TAP Protocol's token authority feature allows it even to reduce it further using only 1 transaction, which makes it also attractive for simple individual transfers. Token authorities require additional setup configurations however, while airdrops work out of the box. A Note on Tap Protocol and the Technology Trac Core is an indexing solution (created by Trac Systems) designed to enable decentralized tracking of Ordinals metaprotocols on Bitcoin. Trac Systems is also the creator of the Tap Protocol. Creating the $KARMA tokens on the Tap Protocol was conducted by the community. Tap Protocol is a similar to BRC-20 and allows for features and hooks into DeFi that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be possible natively. In layman-terms, Tap Protocol can be seen as BRC-20 \u201con steroids\u201d. Taps airdrop feature is cheap because it combines receivers of different token types and amounts into 1 inscription. About $KARMA (https://karmacoin.xyz/) $KARMA is more than a token; it's a commitment to growth, community, and innovation. Designed as a catalyst to expand the OCM and Ordinals ecosystems, $KARMA is set to redefine engagement and opportunity for the entire Ordinals community and beyond. $KARMA is a network of founders, builders, industry leaders and seasoned collectors in the Ordinals ecosystem.

Interviewer: Hua, freelance writer, independent researcher. X: @AmelieHua Interviewee: Poly, a Controls Specialist, maintains multiple Distributed Control Systems (DCS's) and has worked with other five nine systems (99.999% uptime availability). X: @Polyd_ Covenants are an old yet fresh topic. As early as 2013, developers began discussing this topic, and in recent years, multiple BIPs aimed at implementing covenants have been proposed, sparking intense debates and making it one of the hottest topics. Covenants warrant serious discussion due to their powerful capabilities. They are considered to bring new possibilities to the programmability of Bitcoin and are believed to enable smart contracts. For Bitcoin, this is undoubtedly a double-edged sword. In this article, we will explore what covenants are, how they work, their robust functionality, and their significance for Bitcoin. While discussing details, this article often uses CTV as an example, but CTV is not the only method of implementing covenants. This article delves into the exploration of covenants but also magnifies a slice of Bitcoin under a microscope for observation. Through this observation, we can understand how Bitcoin operates at a granular level, comprehending both its capabilities and limitations. Understanding what it cannot do is as crucial as understanding what it can do because only then can we choose the right path for building on Bitcoin. 1. Hua: Before discussing covenants, clarifying two issues related to Bitcoin may be necessary, which can help us better understand covenants. We know that Bitcoin uses a scripting language, and it is known that scripting languages support the implementation of smart contracts. However, in reality, smart contracts have not been implemented on the Bitcoin main chain. This inevitably creates a sense that implementing smart contracts on Bitcoin faces some insurmountable obstacles, and it seems impossible on the Bitcoin network. However, many people may not be aware that although Bitcoin can be programmed using a scripting language, the set of opcodes is extremely limited. This limited set of opcodes restricts the programmability scope of Bitcoin, meaning that, although the scripting language can implement smart contracts, programmers do not have sufficient \"tools\" to implement smart contracts. Poly: Definitely, Bitcoin Script can be considered limiting as it can only perform the basic operations such as making simple payments. Some of the reasons that people may find it \u201climiting\u201d is that it doesn\u2019t have a global state, it\u2019s not considered turing complete, it uses a UTXO-based system (which has \u201cvalue blindness\u201d) instead of an account-based system. The last big reason is that very little data from the blockchain itself can be integrated into contracts causing blockchain-blindness. This has created a lot of challenges over the years as people have worked around these limitations. We\u2019ve also had a semantic shift with the term \u201csmart contract\u201d to mean one specific thing when you should consider the lightning network a production of many smart contracts formed by many individuals. Those multi-sigs with hashlocks and timelocks are not only smart contracts, but also have time-based covenants. The problem is, just as you mentioned before, because Bitcoin only has simple opcodes to perform just the basics, if you attempt to scale beyond two people in a smart contract, you can get either a lot of bloat for an on-chain footprint or the things you want to do just might not be possible. This strict limitation comes from a few places, I think the biggest being that when the inflation bug occurred back in 2010, Satoshi had disabled a whole list of higher order opcodes including OP_CAT which would\u2019ve allowed us to create more dynamic smart contracts via transaction introspection. BCH has since overcome this limitation within their own script, showing that Script isn\u2019t as weak as everyone assumes, just that Bitcoin has always been slower due to its decentralization and coordination is near impossible except over long periods of time. We\u2019ve also barely touched on Taproot and Tapscript which will alleviate a lot of the footprint concerns and allows for new behaviors such as BitVM by rolling up the contract into the signature and you only reveal as necessary. Hua: Why are there strict limitations on opcodes? Can you use OP_CAT as an example to help us understand this point? Poly: So OP_CAT is deceptively simple, it will take two strings and add them together. It was originally disabled because it had resource issues and could be used to cause nodes to crash, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the full story as Satoshi set the 520 byte stack limit and disabled OP_CAT in the same commit so there could be more to it than just simple resource exhaustion. But just to give a short list of what OP_CAT can perform: CTV/TXHASH covenants, verify SPV proofs, double-spend protection for 0-conf TXs, 64-bit arithmetic, vaults, quantum-resistant signatures. The list goes on, with OP_CAT alone, it can emulate both CTV[CheckTemplateVerify] and TXHASH style transactions. The only issue is it\u2019s highly inefficient in the manner that it performs these actions that might be possible, but that could just preclude these transactions from being desirable except by users of scale such as custodians. 2. Hua: Let's talk about another \"limitation\" of Bitcoin. Bitcoin only supports \"verification\" as a form of computation and can't do general-purpose computation. We also know that, for example, smart contracts on Ethereum contain rules for state transitions. It completes the state transition through computation, enabling the functionality of smart contracts. In comparison, Bitcoin can't do general-purpose computation, meaning it cannot achieve state transitions through computation on its own. Is my understanding correct? Poly: Yeah, I\u2019d agree that\u2019s a simple summary of the current state of things. Bitcoin could be made to support computational transactions and the line can become quite thin when covenants and state transitions are involved, but those proposals aren\u2019t as well researched and might not be something that\u2019s considered desirable. I\u2019m actually not that much of a fan of the way Ethereum does things. Due to it being computational in nature with the verification built on-top, if I attempt to perform a trade, my window could shift and I could \u201cfail to trade\u201d but the transaction for the attempt to trade was still valid so i still paid for fees which wasted my money on what i\u2019d want to consider a failed transaction and wasted blockspace for someone else. Another weird aspect are the Oracles in Ethereum. Oracles must pay gas to update their oracle prices whereas in Bitcoin DLC\u2019s, the Oracle are blinded and are just providing a signature and can\u2019t be \u201cpinned\u201d due to a change in fees nor can Oracles target specific contracts. Earlier I discussed all the downsides to the UTXO model compared to the account model and global state model, but what allows the UTXO model to shine is parallelism. The only concern you have is the child transactions to the same UTXO, nothing else matters, this allows the system to scale much better. 3. Hua: Let's start discussing covenants now. What are covenants? Poly: Covenants usually refer to restrictions on how coins can be transferred. The word covenant seems to carry some sort of connotation with it so it helps to demystify it and explain it as simple locking mechanisms you can place only on your *own* coin. We have two covenants already inside Bitcoin and they power the Lightning Network, CSV [CheckSequenceVerify] and CLTV [CheckLockTimeVerify]. Some just call these opcodes \u201csmart contract primitives\u201d as they\u2019re simple time locks, but they can also be classified as time covenants. CTV [CheckTemplateVerify] is a proposed Bitcoin upgrade and is included in BIP 119. It is different from CSV and CLTV, you can think of CTV as a \u201cTXID [Transaction ID] lock\u201d or \u201cUTXO lock\u201d, only these TXID\u2019s can be made from this lock. For CTV, we refer to this TXID lock as \u201cEquality Covenants\u201d as the resulting transactions must equal to the original transactions that were committed. It\u2019s also called a deferred commitment covenant, as you can see that your UTXO has been committed to, but it isn\u2019t yet placed on-chain. The most known alternative is SH_APO [Any Previous Out or AnyPrevOut] which focuses on the payout commitment being ensured while allowing the pay-in method to be flexible. A few others discussed are OP_CCV [also known as MATT], OP_EXPIRE, TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY. Hua: When you mention \"covenants usually refer to restrictions on how coins can be transferred,\" can I understand it like this: Covenants are a method of specifying how funds can be used, or in other words, it's a way of restricting where funds can be spent. Poly: Yep, it effectively earmarks the UTXO to be distributed in a specific manner, once you commit to it, you can't take it back, it's now consensus bound, and only its new owner can decide how to spend their funds. When a UTXO is created on-chain, our instinct is to assume that a single private key is holding that UTXO in place. But if it was a CTV bound UTXO, when the UTXO is spent, you'll see an extra 32 byte hash paired with the new transaction that represents the hidden state that was inside the original UTXO. Hua: You've mentioned \"TXID lock/UTXO lock\" multiple times. Can I understand it like this: To understand how CTV achieves their functionality, we need to understand what TXID lock is and how it works. TXID lock is a key mechanism. Poly: Yes, It creates a strong foundation to build further schemes. The TXID is determined by the contents of a tx. And if you can add inputs to a tx, you can manipulate the TXID. CTV makes you lock the number of inputs and outputs. This is how we ensure that CTV commitments are trustless, if the TXID could be malleable, you could potentially be able to steal someone\u2019s funds. Once you have a TXID locking mechanism, you combine it with other locking mechanisms such as the time locks to build even greater smart contracts. 4. Hua: Why do you think covenants are a rabbit hole? Poly: I call covenants a rabbit hole because there\u2019s so much you can do with simple restrictions on transactions such as a time lock or a TXID lock. We\u2019ve managed to build the entire Lightning network with simple time locks and while it isn\u2019t perfect, it is the only truly decentralized L2 in existence. I don\u2019t like how it\u2019s slowly shifting towards being custodial focused, but that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019ve started down this rabbit hole to begin with: To make our smart contracts more powerful. We refer to the TXID lock as a Template. With Taproot, we gained the ability to have signature aggregation. With Templates and CTV, we gain the ability to have transaction aggregation. CTV serves as a replacement for a pre-signed transaction oracle, which eliminates the trust and interactivity requirements needed to create more sophisticated smart contracts that are needed for things like vaults and payment pools. The vaults and payment pools that you can make with CTV are technically possible today, but currently they\u2019re precluded by the trust or interactivity needed to make it work. Moreover, with CTV, we can build channel factories, additional layer 2 solutions such as Ark, Timeout-Trees, Stakechains or Surfchains, and JIT fidelity bond solutions such as PathCoin. Probably my favorite feature is Non-Interactive Channels [NIC\u2019s] that we\u2019ve also been referring to as Cold Channels. The basic idea is to take a normal lightning channel and simply place it in a CTV template. What makes this different from a normal lightning channel is that neither party actually needed to be online to create this channel. So if I need a channel with another person, I don\u2019t need them to be online to create it, I don\u2019t even need to tell them I made it until I\u2019m ready to spend from it! This allows for cold storage capability on lightning because I don\u2019t need a watchtower nor a node to safeguard my funds in any channels that aren\u2019t yet active. Third-party coordinators can also establish NIC\u2019s for two individuals so there\u2019s a lot of flexibility in what\u2019s possible. As it stands, CTV won\u2019t allow you to build a DEX on-chain, but I\u2019m not sure if that is such a bad thing as people are currently trying to build DEX\u2019s off-chain using the Lightning Network as it is today. I think this ties back into the \u201cVerification vs Computation\u201d discussion, how much do you really want on-chain versus how much do you need to verify on-chain. One concern I have about on-chain DEX\u2019s, besides the excessive on-chain updates driving higher fees, is MEV. We\u2019ve already spotted some MEV from BCH\u2019s DEX\u2019s transactions and as the market matures, this is bound to get worse. Hua: Can you give an example to help us understand how CTV works? Poly: Let\u2019s say I am expecting to receive 5 BTC, as of right now, the only thing I can do is receive the payment and verify it on-chain. With CTV, I can commit to future addresses or to people and reduce it down to a simple pubkey that I give to my payer to pay me. They don\u2019t know the details of it so it remains private to everyone but me. Once I can confirm that they\u2019ve paid me, all of the actions I took using the CTV template have now also taken effect. So if I had elected to create a channel with Bob, once Alice pays me, the channel with Bob is now committed, even though the channel with Bob is nowhere to be seen on-chain, it is only accessible by my template and the transaction that Alice had created. It\u2019s only known to me until I share the channel details with Bob. Once I do share the details with Bob, we can use the channel as normal. When we cooperatively close the channel, instead of needing to place an open channel details on-chain, we just place the closing channel on-chain. This allows us to perform transaction cut-through, reducing the total number of transactions that need to be on-chain by at least half for layer 2 solutions. The opening portion only needs a commitment, what we really care about are the closing details. If this was a shared UTXO with multiple people, we could collaborate to close our transactions together as well, reducing the number of on-chain transactions even further. 5. Hua: As you mentioned before, we can introduce different opcodes to implement covenants. Poly: So if we re-introduced OP_CAT, I think it would allow for nearly every type of covenant possible as you can emulate any form of introspection for TXHASH. The more limited method would be to introduce opcodes representing the explicit behavior desired like with CTV, CSFS or CheckSeperateSignature. CTV is the ability to do deferred outputs. CSFS is the ability to do deferred signatures so you can defer the payment itself. They sound similar and in fact they work well together as building blocks to enable LN-Symmetry, but the commitments are happening at different levels. TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY both enable introspection and serve the same purpose, but TEMPLATE KEY uses a single-byte mode while TXHASH uses multi-byte flags. This allows for much more powerful capabilities inside script and smart contracts, but many are concerned about the side effects it could have. TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY are more of a CTVv2, something that would make CTV more powerful and expressive. Hua: I've noticed that there doesn't seem to be a significant disagreement about whether to support the implementation of covenants. However, in comparison, there seems to be more significant divergence among people regarding which method or set of opcodes to add to implement covenants. Poly: I think a large part is there\u2019s different camps of thought. There\u2019s a lot of the lack of understanding the intent behind each proposal as they have different goals in mind and are designed in completely different ways. A lot of developers have only had their eye on Lightning and how it\u2019s to evolve, they tend to favor opcodes like SH_APO since it enables LN-Symmetry. For a lot of developers that don\u2019t particularly like Lightning due to its limitations such as Inbound Liquidity constraints or the requirement to be online, they tend to favor opcodes like OP_CAT, TXHASH as more expressive scaling solutions. The developers that prefer CTV are more neutral and are looking at it from a systems point of view, it doesn\u2019t necessarily do any one thing perfectly but it greatly enhances everyone\u2019s ability to do their preferred thing, whatever it may be without introducing risks that can\u2019t be measured since it doesn\u2019t introduce introspection. 6. Hua: Before discussing covenants, we talked about issues related to opcodes in scripting language and the problem of limited computation leading to state transition. We already know the relationship between covenants and opcodes. Now, let's delve into the issue of state transition. I'm not sure if looking at covenants from the perspective of \"state transition\" is correct, but this perspective truly fascinates me. Without covenants, the scripting language's main function is to retrieve transactions' signatures and verify them. The transaction can only be completed when the private key is correct, and there is no intermediate state. With covenants, a transaction can be completed when certain conditions are met. Moreover, a transaction can only be completed when specific conditions are satisfied (not just the correctness of the private key). Can we understand it this way: Covenants indirectly provide conditions for state transition. Poly: The covenant is the template shell or the \"state\". Inside of it, you're going to need to make time locks and other functions to enable the desired functionality that you\u2019re wanting, be that a vault, lightning channel or some other layer 2 solution. So CTV allows for the state creation to occur, but you have to dynamically rebuild the state at each transition to keep it in homeostasis, we call this meta-recursive. Whereas something like SH_APO allows you to create a state and then periodically update that state, making it recursive. CTV can also create a chain of transactions that would allow you to \u201cstep-through\u201d that state. A good example to think about is Ark, it\u2019s a giant smart contract, almost like a giant coinjoin and the one running the protocol creates a new state [or rounds as it\u2019s called] every few seconds to facilitate participants to pay others as needed. Once the Ark operator is ready, they will send a transaction to the mempool to commit the current state to on-chain. These on-chain placeholders can be thought of as the \u201ctransition states.\u201d The operator has to constantly recompute new states to present to the Ark participants and what\u2019s sent to on-chain is the verification of that state. Hua: Can we understand it this way: Covenants implement a form of smart contract based on verification rather than computation? Poly: Yes. Definitely. This smart contract is just comparing a transaction to an associated sha256 hash. Block speed verification would actually increase since there\u2019s no signature operations. Hua: One direction of development for blockchains is modularity, including off-chain computation. However, Bitcoin seems naturally designed for off-chain computation, appearing behind but actually leading the way. What do you think? Poly: Time is a flat circle. It\u2019s crazy how it seems like we\u2019ve come full circle to what\u2019s wanted in a blockchain. Bitcoin still seems to have some modularity issues and footprint issues. I wish we had better side-chains that weren\u2019t simply multi-sig solutions and used actual cryptographic means to secure one\u2019s funds and allowed for Unilateral Exits. I think that would help push the boundaries on Bitcoin\u2019s modularity. Taproot has allowed for even more off-chain computation with things such as BitVM, which would allow us to compute almost anything off-chain. But unfortunately, it can\u2019t emulate things inside Bitcoin such as CTV so it seems we still have progress to make. 7. Hua: What possibilities can be achieved by combining covenants with other opcodes like DLC? Poly: So DLC\u2019s have a few problems that would be fixed with covenants such as increasing the flexibility of the parameters of the DLC by making many price points [if we\u2019re wagering on the price of something such as Bitcoin]. Another one is that hardware wallets [HWW] can\u2019t interact with a lot of DLC\u2019s, the signing rounds for DLCs and attempting to do it with HWWs causes DLCs to take several minutes to open. With CTV, this delay to enter a DLC can be reduced down to seconds. 8. Hua: Are there any other points you'd like to introduce to the readers? Poly: We went over a lot of concepts. We touched on how it can be used to mitigate excessive blockspace demand and potential ddos attacks. We discussed how people could save space by making Non-Interactive Channels. I think another good one to discuss is the \"L2 exit problem\". If we managed to get everyone off of the L1 layer and get them onto a large L2, there's currently no good way to get people off that L2 in an expedited manner. We could think of that L2 as Lightning [we call the potential mass exodus on Lightning, the \"Thundering Herd problem\u201d], or we could think of Coinbase, Binance or Liquid as the L2. There are people who hold claims to Bitcoin, but their only way to actually acquire that claim is by submitting a transaction to get it placed on-chain. There's millions of people on Coinbase, I have no idea how to get them off of there and onto Bitcoin in any orderly fashion in today's environment. There would be a mempool backlog of 6 months attempting to get people off the exchange. CTV can fix this. Make an Ark or a Timeout-Tree with CTV. The exchange could even offer the service directly. Everyone could be offloaded from the original \"shared UTXO\" that was under Coinbase's consensus and pushed into a \"shared UTXO\" with a consensus of their choice, be it a simple pool or a large Timeout-Tree. This is where it really wrinkles the brain, this was a pure L2 <> L2 conversion. There was no intermediary step requiring me to go down to L1 first. And I can continue repeating this process indefinitely, using any layer of my choice. There isn\u2019t a need to return to the base layer unless I was forced there such as from an uncooperative closeout from my channel or perhaps an unvaulting from my vault. The Ark and Timeout-Tree pitfall is that they have rollover requirements, you have to move your funds every few weeks or months or you forfeit your funds. This isn\u2019t an ideal solution for long-term funds but works great for any short term holdings and larger markets. I'd like to provide a full list of every concept that\u2019s been developed using CTV and its ability to simply aggregate pre-signed transactions: Non-Interactive Channels, Timeout-Trees, Ark, Darkpools, Payment Pools, Payment Channels, Ball Lightning, Congestion Control, Dpool's, Compaction, Tree Swaps, PathCoin, Stakechains, Surfchains. But don\u2019t think of these as all independent Templates, if there\u2019s a feature of one that you wish to include in another, you can create your own custom Template to try and find your desired behavior.

Without this, in one way or another, you are relinquishing control of your money to someone else. \u201cNot your keys, not your coins\u201d as the saying goes. A counter-intuitive aspect of Bitcoin for people who aren\u2019t familiar with the technical underpinnings of it is \u201cwhere\u201d your Bitcoin actually is. When people think of a wallet, they think \u201cthe place where I keep my money.\u201d Your bitcoin wallet doesn\u2019t actually \u201chold\u201d your Bitcoin, it just stores your private keys. Your Bitcoin is just entries of data on the blockchain hosted by everyone participating in the network. When you go to spend your bitcoin, what you are actually doing is proposing an update to the data stored on the blockchain. A private key is how the protocol ensures that you, and you alone, can authorize an update to the blockchain that spends your Bitcoin. So what are your private keys? Just very large numbers. Extremely large. This is a private key in binary: 1110001011011001011110111100000101000100000010001001111010111011010101110111001111111111101010111010010111010011101001110010100110111101000110000111110101111001101001011110011011101000001101101101110001101000110001111010001001001111011010101011001101101010 256 random 1s and 0s. This random number is what ultimately secures your Bitcoin. It might not look like much, but its randomness is what ensures your wallet\u2019s security. There are almost as many possible Bitcoin private keys as there are atoms in the visible universe. That is how many numbers a computer would have to count through to generate and catalog all the private keys potentially possible. As long as the process used to generate the keys is truly random, your keys are safe. This is what a private key looks like in hexadecimal (binary uses two digits to encode a number, 1 and 0, hexadecimal uses 16 digits, 0-9 and A-F): E2D97BC144089EBB5773FFABA5D3A729BD187D79A5E6E836DC68C7A24F6AB36A This is what a private key looks like in uncompressed Wallet Import Format (WIF): 5KYC9aMMSDWGJciYRtwY3mNpeTn91BLagdjzJ4k4RQmdhQvE98G WIF format is how everyone used to interact with their private keys in the early days of Bitcoin. In this era, you could generate one private key at a time, and then you\u2019d generate the public key from that. The process of generating a public key is essentially just the multiplication of very large numbers but there is a bit more to it than that.. All public keys are an x and y point on a graph showing a very, very large curve that loops back on itself. On the graph curve, in Bitcoin\u2019s case Secp256k1, there is a point called the \u201cgenerator point.\u201d This generator point can be thought of as the \u201cbase point\u201d on the Secp256k1 curve. It is integral to the process of generating keys and signing with them. This is what the generator point is for Bitcoin\u2019s curve: G = 02 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798 To generate the public key from your private key, you take the private key you generated and multiply it by the generator point. That\u2019s it. This now establishes a point on the graph with a mathematical relationship to the private key you generated that only you know. This is an uncompressed public key showing both x and y points: 04C0E410A572C880D1A2106AFE1C6EA2F67830ABCC8BBDF24729F7BF3AFEA06158F0C04D7335D051A92442330A50B8C37CE0EC5AFC4FFEAB41732DA5108261FFED It is very common to \u201ccompress\u201d public keys in the rare chance you interact with them to just store the x coordinate with a byte to tell you whether the y coordinate is negative or positive. That shortens it considerably: 04C0E410A572C880D1A2106AFE1C6EA2F67830ABCC8BBDF24729F7BF3AFEA06158F0C04D7335D051A92442330A50B8C37CE0EC5AFC4FFEAB41732DA5108261FFED When you go to sign a transaction with your private key, it once again boils down to essentially just multiplication. By generating a random number (the nonce), and using that and your private key to essentially multiply the hash of the transaction you are signing, you produce the signature (which is made up of two values, r, and S). This allows someone to run an algorithm to verify the message was signed by the appropriate private key without revealing that key. The thing guaranteeing only you can authorize spending your Bitcoin is essentially just the multiplication of very, very large numbers. If you aren\u2019t all that familiar with these concepts before reading this, all of this probably seems somewhat intimidating. Binary? Hexadecimal? Graph points? How do you back up a WIF? Since the development of more intuitive ways of handling this data, most users are unfamiliar with these complicated formats. Most likely, you have more experience with word seeds, also known as seed phrases. BIP 39 Mnemonic Seeds Mnemonic seeds, or seed phrases, were created to address the problem of the experience of interacting with your private keys. As we discussed earlier, private keys are ultimately just a long series of 1s and 0s that are randomly generated. Imagine trying to create copies of this and ensure you didn\u2019t make an error transcribing it: 1110001011011001011110111100000101000100000010001001111010111011010101110111001111111111101010111010010111010011101001110010100110111101000110000111110101111001101001011110011011101000001101101101110001101000110001111010001001001111011010101011001101101010 All it would take is a single error copying one digit to render a backup of your keys useless. This is where mnemonic seeds come in handy. 256 consecutive 1s and 0s in a row is not a human-friendly way to interact with sensitive information. Recording this number incorrectly means losing access to your account. truck renew fury donkey remind laptop reform detail split grief because fat That is much easier to deal with, isn\u2019t it? Just 12 words. So how does that work, going from a bunch of random 1s and 0s to a string of words that actually make sense to you? An encoding scheme, just like binary or hexadecimal! Each of those 12 words in that mnemonic seed above is a binary number in an encoding scheme mapping specific strings of 1s and 0s to words. If we look back at the WIF private key example earlier, that was simply a number encoded in a specific encoding scheme, in that case, base 58, which uses every number and letter of the alphabet except 0 and 1, and O and l (case sensitive). The exclusion of those characters was done specifically to make transcription errors unlikely by confusing a 1 for an l, or a 0 for an O. bech32 and bech32m used by Segwit and Taproot take this to the next level by using only this set of characters (qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l). Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 (BIP 39), introduced a standardized encoding scheme where each word in a specially crafted dictionary is alphabetically mapped to a binary number from 00000000001 to 11111111111. The demonstration seed above maps to this: truck: 11101001001 renew: 10110110001 fury: 01011110011 donkey: 01000001001 remind: 10110101110 laptop: 01111101000 reform: 10110100010 detail: 00111100010 split: 11010010001 grief: 01100110100 because: 00010011110 fat: 01010011011 In just binary it looks like this: 11101001001 10110110001 01011110011 01000001001 10110101110 01111101000 10110100010 00111100010 11010010001 01100110100 00010011110 0101001 1011 There are 2048 words, each mapped to a specific 11 digit string of 1s and 0s, specifically to make it easier for people to interact with their private keys. When you generate a random number for your private key, your wallet cuts that number up into chunks of 11 digit binary numbers and maps them to the BIP 39 Mnemonic dictionary. It\u2019s still the same large number, but now you can read it as English words. Since your brain is much more accustomed to this format than long strings of 1s and 0s, this drastically reduces the odds of you writing down something wrong and losing your Bitcoin in the process. You may have noticed that in the raw binary encoding of the word seed above, there are four digits (1011) sitting off on their own, and the last \u201cword\u201d is only actually 8 digits. That is a checksum to ensure that a seed phrase is valid. When you generate your random number, there aren\u2019t enough digits to map it exactly to 12 (or 24) words. The wallet hashes those existing digits you generated and takes the first few digits of the hash to add on to the end of your random number. This gives you enough digits to map to the last word. This last word allows you to perform a safety check on copies of your seed. If you enter your mnemonic seed into a wallet incorrectly, the checksum will not match. Each 12 or 24 word seed has multiple potential valid checksum words, but if the last word doesn\u2019t match the checksum of a correct seed your wallet will warn you it is invalid. This gives people an intuitive yet still mathematical way to guarantee their backups are correct, unlike the messy process of transcribing and backing up the raw binary numbers. The selection of the specific words on the list even went so far as to guarantee that none of the 2048 words have the same first four letters. This was done to reduce the likelihood of people making transcription errors by confusing similar words and winding up with an incorrect backup of their private keys. Translating these words into a set of multiple private/public keys is quite simple. Your mnemonic seed is taken and hashed using SHA512, which outputs a hash of 512 individual 1s and 0s. Half of that output is used as an actual private key, and the other half is used as input to SHA512 with an index number and the existing private or public key to generate a new key pair. You can do this as many times as you want to generate new private/public keys that can all be recovered from your single mnemonic phrase. This ensures that you can manage your private keys as easily, and safely, as possible with the lowest odds of making a mistake that loses your money. And all of it was done using math! Hopefully, now you have a good understanding of why people say that Bitcoin is money \u2018secured by math.\u2019","article_summary":"How large numbers and randomness secure your bitcoin, and what your seed phrase has to do with it.

The country will address more pressing concerns related to food security and energy sustainability. Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir voiced her apprehensions about the nation\u2019s energy consumption patterns. Especially in light of the increasing demands from the cryptocurrency mining industry. Bitcoin Mining Threatens Iceland\u2019s Sustainability, PM Warns Iceland, nestled atop the Mid-Atlantic ridge, is a haven for Bitcoin miners, thanks to its abundant renewable energy resources. The country\u2019s vast reserves of hydro and geothermal energy have made it an attractive destination for data centers dedicated to the energy-intensive process of Bitcoin mining. However, this has led to an unprecedented surge in energy consumption. Currently, the country consumes about 120 MW of power, making it the most Bitcoin-mining-dense region globally. The Prime Minister expressed concerns over the sustainability of this energy consumption, especially considering the adverse impacts on other vital sectors like agriculture. \u201cData centers in Iceland use a significant share of our green energy,\u201d Jakobsdóttir remarked, This revelation comes at a time when the global balance of Bitcoin mining is experiencing a shift. New players are continuously entering the mining scene. Thanks to its cheap electricity and entrepreneurial spirit, Iceland, once a pioneer in industrial-scale Bitcoin mining, is now reevaluating its stance in light of broader economic and environmental considerations.

Jakobsdóttir\u2019s proposed pivot towards bolstering food production signifies a strategic redirection of Iceland\u2019s renewable energy resources to support more sustainable and essential sectors. This will ensure energy security for households and industries beyond crypto mining. Crypto Mining Industry Prepares for Post-Halving Shake-Up This strategic shift is reflective of a broader trend within the crypto-mining industry. Which is bracing for significant changes after the anticipated Bitcoin halving event in April. Industry experts, including Marathon Digital Holdings CEO Fred Thiel, have warned of the impending financial pressures on smaller miners. Which could lead to a consolidation in favor of larger players with more robust financial backing. \u201cPost halving I think you\u2019ll see the smaller miners come under financial stress, which will enable the bigger miners to consolidate the industry,\u201d Thiel stated.

This innovation introduces direct beneficial ownership in US Treasury Bills to the blockchain. The significance of this launch lies in its approach to solving a longstanding issue within Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization\u2014the challenge of legally and accurately representing ownership and interest. US Treasury Bill Tokens Now on Real-World Assets Exchange The concept of depositary receipts has a rich history in facilitating international investment, dating back to their inception in the 1920s. Traditionally, these instruments enabled investors to access foreign markets with relative ease. Adapting this established structure, DigiFT aims to address the legal representation of token holders\u2019 interests in Real-World Assets. Currently, the market is saturated with wrapped tokens, which often come entangled in legal frameworks that obscure direct ownership. This can pose significant hurdles for investors seeking to navigate the implications of their investments. By contrast, DigiFT\u2019s deployment of depository receipt tokens offers a clear, legally coherent framework. This model simplifies investment comprehension and ensures investors have a direct claim on the returns of the underlying assets. Read more: What is The Impact of Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization?

Even marker observers have been impressed with the record performance of these financial products. However, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), one of the prominent products, has experienced consistent outflows, sparking concerns about its future trajectory. Grayscale\u2019s GBTC Bitcoin Reserve Depletes Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics firm, has forecasted that GBTC could deplete its Bitcoin reserves within the next 96 days if the current rate of redemptions persists. Since its conversion into a spot Bitcoin ETF in January, Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin balance has plummeted by 266,470 BTC. This marks a significant decline from its initial holding of approximately 620,000 BTC. The downward trend is attributed to consistent outflows from GBTC averaging 25,900 BTC per week. \u201cGrayscale started the year holding 618,280 BTC for their Bitcoin Trust GBTC. They now hold only 356,440 BTC. If they carry on like this, there\u2019s only 14 weeks until they run out for good,\u201d analysts at Arkham Intelligence remarked.

On the other hand, market observers have attributed the GBTC outflows to its high fee structure. At the same time, Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, noted that the past week\u2019s outflows were predominantly from the defunct crypto lender Genesis. Grayscale is exploring various initiatives to counteract this outflow trend. Some of these include introducing a mini fund providing a cost-effective alternative to GBTC. Sonnenshein also mentioned the firm\u2019s plan to reduce its 1.5% fee, which stands in stark contrast to competitors\u2019 rates ranging from 0.2% to 0.5%. \u201cWe have seen this in countless other exposures, countless other markets, you name it, where typically when products are earlier in their lifecycle, when they\u2019re new to be introduced, these tend to be higher.

This milestone reflects the growing traction and interest in this network, particularly focusing on meme coins and airdrops. Coinbase\u2019s Base Network on the Rise Base, engineered on the Optimism tech stack, has been pivotal in scaling Ethereum by enhancing transaction speed and reducing costs, all while maintaining the robust security of the Ethereum mainnet. The success of Base can largely be attributed to its parent company, Coinbase. This is a behemoth cryptocurrency exchange with a valuation surpassing $60 billion. Coinbase\u2019s strategic positioning as the custodian for 90% of US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and its alliance with giants like Blackrock and Circle have significantly contributed to Base\u2019s momentum. Indeed, Jesse Pollak, the architect behind Base, highlighted that a substantial portion of Coinbase\u2019s revenue is funneled into Base\u2019s development. \u201cWe are ramping up gas grants to let builders get started building for free and build gasless experiences, [as well as] builder grants to reward folks who make a positive impact on base and give them resources to build the next thing. Gas grants will be upfront, with path to scaling. Builder grants will be primarily retroactive because we\u2019ve observed that creates aligned incentives and a strong builder culture,\u201d Pollak said. This strategic move reflects Coinbase\u2019s vision of leveraging Base as a gateway for over 110 million users into the crypto market. The platform\u2019s integration with Coinbase\u2019s expansive user base provides a fertile ground for user acquisition, a common challenge for new blockchains. Read more: Coinbase Review 2024: The Best Crypto Exchange for Beginners? Base Network Users. Source: Dune For this reason, this strategy has led to an unprecedented uptick in Base\u2019s adoption. In March, daily new users hit 800,000, revenue climbed from $18 million to $28 million, and daily transactions soared from 500,000 to 2 million. This surge is partially attributed to the Ethereum Dencun upgrade. The implementation of EIP-4844 drastically reduced network fees, making Base a formidable competitor for high-frequency trading. Base Meme Coins and Airdrops to Watch The momentum around Base suggests a growing interest in meme coins and airdrops. With the ecosystem still in its infancy, the potential for discovery and investment in meme coins is vast. According to analyst Miles Deutscher, a methodical approach involving the tracking of token trading volumes and holder counts can unveil promising opportunities within this space. Toshi Base, for instance, is a meme coin that stands due to its strong community and its position as a first mover. \u201cThose who follow my content know I\u2019m a proponent of following the leader when it comes to narrative trading, in this case TOSHI is the leading meme on Base,\u201d Deutscher emphasized.

These include bridges like Across and Stargate, decentralized exchanges like ODOS and Aerodrome, and lending protocols like Moonwell and Seamless.
