It\u2019s also a key force for mass adoption. Yet, the journey towards fully realizing the potential of Web3 gaming is fraught with challenges, notably the seamless integration of on-chain elements without sacrificing the core tenets of decentralization and player empowerment.\nNew users should only experience friction if necessary, and as late as possible. That\u2019s not the case with most existing Web3 games. From connecting their wallets upfront to signing transactions for verification, users face multiple hurdles before actually trying the game. These frictions contrast starkly with the vision of a seamless and accessible gaming world that fully on-chain gaming aspires to achieve.\nTitles such as Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties, though groundbreaking, fall short of being fully on-chain. Fully on-chain games store all game assets, mechanics, and states on the blockchain. This radical approach ensures unparalleled transparency, security, and player control, allowing for a truly decentralized gaming experience where players own and shape their digital destinies.\nRelated: Axie Infinity is toxic for crypto gaming\nBuilding the best game demands a functional, efficient combination of on-chain elements and the rich user experience of legacy titles.\nHolding Web3 games to Web2 standards is comparing apples to oranges. Their requirements, value propositions, and scopes differ greatly despite serving similar audiences.\nWeb3 games are meant to solve age-old problems like top-down models, lack of user control, and strong-arming by gaming corporations. That\u2019ll happen only by implementing alternative models, processes, and principles \u2014 not by emulating the outcomes achieved in Web2.\nWe can even argue that terms like \u201cengaging,\u201d \u201cseamless,\u201d and \u201chassle-free,\u201d will take on new meanings in this context, enhanced by other aspects like community orientation, real in-game value, and user-generated logic.\nTherefore, when building Web3 games, the most crucial requirement is to address novel challenges, ideally involving embracing innovative technologies and models that align with the principles of autonomy and community governance. It\u2019s about building \u201cAutonomous Worlds\u201d (AWs), a concept introduced in 2022 by Ludens \u2014 the founder of Lattice.xyz \u2014 to describe \u201ca world with a blockchain substrate.\u201d\nMoreover, new-age games must nurture and serve the expanding community of problem-aware gamers. Those who seek genuine solutions to the odds stacked against them in legacy gaming. Not mere bounty hunters and fleeting profit-mongers.\nBuilding fully on-chain games\nIronically, Axie Infinity and CryptoKitties served as pivotal catalysts in the evolution of blockchain gaming \u2014 but they weren't fully on-chain. They were experimental, niche, and heavily crypto-centric, characterized by their clunky user interfaces. Despite opening up new avenues, they weren\u2019t entirely \"Autonomous Worlds\" either. Users had little or no control over the rules and direction of the game, and only parts of the game states were on-chain.\nneed help my ship is stuck in the ░F░O░G░ pic.twitter.com/Hn6jn3NTOK\n\u2014 The Citadel (@0xCitadel) March 6, 2024\nDark Forest was the first decentralized real-time strategy game, released in 2020. Using zero-knowledge proofs (zkProofs), a cryptographic protocol, to create a \u201cfog of war\u201d in the gaming experience, this project set an example in building incomplete information games on-chain. For reference, think of games like poker, where players only see their hands and don\u2019t know what cards others have.\nThe challenge Dark Forest tackled was maintaining a publicly accessible distributed ledger without compromising the confidentiality of players' strategies \u2014 a fundamental aspect in any strategic gameplay.\nUsing zkProofs, Dark Forest maintained gameplay integrity and player privacy on a blockchain. This approach solved the critical issue of revealing sensitive game states (e.g., planet locations or attack trajectories), which is easily manageable with centralized servers but very challenging in decentralized environments. Dark Forest's solution set a precedent for real-time strategy gaming on the blockchain, providing a blueprint for future on-chain game development.\nThey even sparked the proliferation of community-oriented, bottom-up AWs: Mithraeum, Citadel, ZkHunt, and so on. Loot Project was another interesting addition to this space, letting users permissionlessly expand the IP and spawning hundreds of games, lores, etc.\nMithraeum. Source: Screenshot\nBy putting everything on-chain \u2014 from game states (assets, actions, etc.) to logic (rules of introduction, mechanisms for in-game interactions, etc.), AWs unlock flexible and resilient digital realities where users come of their own.\nGoing beyond in-game asset ownership, they incentivize players to attach greater significance to their on-chain gaming activities. More importantly, on-chain logic provides gamers with a meaningful say in what\u2019s legitimate and what\u2019s not in the game-world.\nThis is a massive departure from the status quo, where end-users are mostly passive consumers, playing at the whims and mercy of corporate publishers. Rules and norms emerge via community consensus, not the arbitrary will of external entities. And they serve grassroots interests. Players can build, contribute, monetize, and participate in ways that are impossible in Web2 games.\nRelated: Why Solana will prevail despite Ethereum ETFs\nThe empowering, skin-in-the-game nature of AWs instills a stronger desire for mastery in gamers. They\u2019re more driven to find creative solutions to solve problems and create mods and plugins to establish entirely separate economies within the game. This participatory fosters a deeper connection to the game, encouraging creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration within the community. For example, Dark Forest players have built a range of bots, plugins, and custom clients they can use to climb a leaderboard.\nAs we look to the future, the journey towards fully on-chain gaming is not without its challenges, yet the promise it holds is immense. By redefining engagement, ownership, and control within the digital realm, on-chain gaming is poised to offer experiences that more closely mirror real-world interactions and relationships. In doing so, it not only enhances the richness of virtual worlds but also establishes a new standard for what gaming can be\u2014truly immersive, empowering, and reflective of the players' desires and aspirations.\nThe principles of decentralization, player sovereignty, and community collaboration will be the guiding lights, shaping the future of gaming into an inclusive, democratic, and exciting digital frontier.\nFelix Xu is a co-founder and CEO of ARPA.

The United States is already at risk, Hill said, and the FDIC shares the blame for that.\nTokenization of bank deposits and other real-world assets (RWA) could make it possible to carry out financial transaction at any time with real-time settlement, Hill said. In addition, it would provide programmability of payments, making it possible to conduct intraday repurchase (repo) exchanges and improve settlement times for some bond issuances and numerous other transactions. Consumers could also benefit from using programmable payments in place of escrow.\nAmong the many open questions about tokenization, Hill mentioned the use, or not, of unified ledgers, blockchain interoperability and ownership rights as assets move along the blockchain. Furthermore:\n\u201cGlobal standards are being established, directly or indirectly, and with many non-U.S. jurisdictions actively engaged in this area, the United States risks ceding influence at this critical stage.\u201d\nProgrammability could reduce settlement risks and Know Your Customer processes, but it could also allow consumers to move their assets quickly, aggravating bank runs. An \u201coff\u201d switch is needed to prevent that, Hill said.\nSource: @FDICgov on X\nRegulatory agencies attempted in the past to set consistent policies with little luck, so \u201cinstead, the agencies established processes under which institutions must engage with their regulator on an individual basis,\u201d Hill said.\nRelated: Inspector General wants FDIC to refine crypto risk assessment process, guidance\nLooking at FDIC regulations, which treat all transactions on a blockchain \u2014 whether they involve RWA or crypto \u2014 the same, Hill found them to be cumbersome and unequally applied:\n\u201cInstitutions have spent months responding to a long stream of information requests, diverting attention away from developing new technologies and systems. [\u2026] The message being heard by the vast majority of the industry could be interpreted as don't bother trying.\u201d\nGuidance is needed from regulators, as is consistency so that deposits in any form are treated the same, Hill said. He criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which requires financial institutions to treat crypto assets differently from any other kind of asset.

The central bank wrote: \n\u201cIn the area of privacy, the architecture will allow the central bank, as the system administrator, to define the types of information required for the operation, control, and monitoring of the system. However, the central bank will not have access to personally identifiable information about end users\u2019 balances and transactions.\u201d\nCurrently, commercial banks in Israel pay 4.86% interest on customers\u2019 fiat shekel deposits and savings. Under the central bank\u2019s plans, banks would be able to hold the shekel CBDC as part of their short-term liquidity buffer, which would be non-interest bearing. \n\u201cThe data structure must enable the system to comply with all of the assumptions defined in Section 2.1, including the ability to enforce holding restrictions and to apply interest,\u201d researchers wrote, adding: \u201cIn particular, in a case where the interest is dependent on the type of user and the size of the balance, there is an advantage to having a centralized database.\u201d\nIsrael has been contemplating the issuance of a digital shekel since 2021, but no concrete pilot tests have been actioned as of the time of publication. \u201cGiven the interdependence between the various components of the digital shekel system, the decisions are not final,\u201d said the Bank of Israel. \nIn April 2023, Cointelegraph reported that the country\u2019s central bank could issue a shekel CBDC if stablecoin use increases. \u201cAt this point, there are no signs of substantial adoption of stablecoins as means of payment in Israel,\u201d the central bank said at the time.\nRelated: Local Web3 community launches \u2018Crypto Aid Israel\u2019 to help displaced citizens\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

While these platforms initially offered promising paths to exposure, the reality has fallen short, leaving artists struggling to secure fair compensation in terms of royalties and control over their work.\nThe issue lies in the way streaming services distribute revenue: a meager portion reaches the artists themselves, with record labels often negotiating significantly higher payouts than indie musicians for their work. Spotify\u2019s reported payout per stream further exemplifies this disparity, falling within a paltry range of $0.003 to $0.005 in 2024.\nAdding insult to injury, Spotify\u2019s recent policy change throws another obstacle in the path of indie artists. In 2024, the platform will cease royalties for tracks receiving fewer than 1,000 streams within a year. While technicalities suggest these tracks will still accrue royalties, the funds will be funneled upward, often benefiting bigger artists. This 1,000-stream cliff creates a significant barrier for indie musicians attempting to break through and build a fanbase.\nOne stat you won\u2019t find in your Spotify Wrapped is how much artists are paid for all that listening on the platform.\n\nThe max possible in 2023 is $0.003 per stream. And in 2024, Spotify will stop paying anything AT ALL for 2/3 of the tracks on the platform. pic.twitter.com/OCMHsHNce5\n\u2014 United Musicians and Allied Workers (@UMAW_) November 29, 2023\nAnother major challenge for indie artists is building a loyal fanbase. The current market is saturated with countless independent artists vying for attention. Building a personal brand and effectively utilizing social media platforms can help indie musicians connect with their audience and cultivate a fanbase, but it takes time, money and effort to make it big.\nHow NFTs can help musicians\nThis is where Web3, particularly nonfungible tokens (NFTs), emerges as a solution with the potential to transform the indie music industry. Music NFTs allow artists to sell songs, albums or exclusive digital content directly to their fans. The NFT approach bypasses intermediaries like record labels and streaming platforms, allowing artists to capture a larger share of the revenue generated by their work. Unlike streaming, where earnings are based on unpredictable play counts, NFTs offer the potential for more transparent and direct income streams.\nMusic NFTs also act as a bridge between artists and their fans, fostering a sense of community and ownership. By owning an NFT, fans actively support the artist and gain access to various benefits like early access to new songs or exclusive behind-the-scenes content.\nThe limitations of current music NFTs\nWhile music NFTs already exist on several blockchains, they can only represent one digital asset, such as a single song. This restriction is highly inflexible, as musicians typically work with multiple songs packaged as an album or playlist.\nThe current music NFTs are permanently static, lacking the capacity for updates or changes. Musicians desire the ability to evolve and modify their music and copyright terms over time, enhancing fan engagement by offering a continuous stream of fresh content.\nAlthough music NFTs hold great promise for fostering deeper connections with fan bases, this potential hinges on one critical factor \u2014 the ability to update the information embedded in the NFT itself.\nIntroducing dynamic Data NFTs\nItheum Protocol, an omni-chain data ownership infrastructure layer , aims to overcome these limitations by allowing musicians to develop and update their content through its Music Data NFT technology.\nAt the heart of the Itheum Protocol lies Data NFT technology, which allows musicians to transform static or dynamic data assets into NFTs. These NFTs function as transferable licenses, granting ownership and control over sharing or trading access rights to the data. Data NFTs empower creators to tokenize their data, similar to other NFT assets, but with the added flexibility of managing access rights.\nUnlike traditional NFTs that represent static assets, Music Data NFTs can be updated by artists, allowing for evolving content. This dynamic capability has the potential to enhance fan engagement, offering features like unlocking additional content upon interaction. Moreover, Music Data NFTs give artists greater control over distribution and royalty structures.\nVerified fans who own Data NFTs can also establish direct communication with artists, creating access opportunities for exclusive content such as unreleased music or merchandise. This connection could strengthen the bond between musicians and their fanbase.\nCointelegraph Accelerator participant Itheum envisions Music Data NFTs operating seamlessly across various blockchains. The envisioned interoperability enables artists to access diverse NFT ecosystems, potentially building fanbases and extending their exposure to a broader audience across various blockchain communities.\nKey features of Data NFTs. Source: Itheum Protocol\nGiving the power to musicians and fans\nMusicians can showcase their Music Data NFTs on NF.Tunes, a Web3 music portal built on Itheum Protocol\u2019s technology. The platform serves as a space for artists to exhibit their music Data NFTs, allowing fans to explore and listen to new music while engaging with artist communities.\nWith its Music Data NFTs, Itheum paves the way for a more artist-centric future in the music industry. By addressing the limitations of the current NFT models, Itheum offers a glimpse into a future where indie musicians not only navigate the labyrinthine world of music but thrive in it.\nAre you an indie musician who wants to use Music Data NFTs?

Tron and Ethereum are the two largest blockchains for USDT at the time of writing, accounting for 50% and 45% of all issued USDT, respectively, according to Tether Transparency.\nThe news comes amid the crypto community increasingly complaining about high fees on the Ethereum network as Ether (ETH) prices pass $4,000. Skyrocketing ETH fees have also impacted Ethereum-based USDT, as ERC-20 Tether USDT requires ETH gas fees to complete transactions.\nDespite Celo being an EVM-compatible network, there is no dependency on Ethereum in terms of network fees, according to a source close to Celo. \u201cFor example, if Ethereum fees go up, it doesn\u2019t mean L2 fees, given certain architectural choices, go up in the same way or at all even,\u201d the person noted.\nMagazine: The DeFi bots pumping Solana\u2019s stablecoin volume\nExchange or buy USDT\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

Decisions are made collaboratively in an environment where the power is distributed among members, not concentrated in a central authority. This concept, once confined to the realm of science fiction, is now taking shape in the form of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\nDAOs are internet-based organizations fueled by blockchain technology. They function through smart contracts, self-executing code that automates decision-making based on established rules. Ownership and voting rights are often linked to crypto tokens, empowering members to actively shape the DAO\u2019s trajectory. This structure upholds transparency as all transactions and decisions are permanently recorded on the blockchain, accessible for public scrutiny.\nThe challenges around DAOs\nBut as with any disruptive innovation, DAOs come with their own set of challenges, raising a critical question: can they truly revolutionize governance, or are they destined to remain a captivating experiment?\nOne of the most significant challenges facing DAOs is the potential for large tokenholders, known as whales, to influence voting outcomes in their favor. Due to their extensive holdings, whales can manipulate governance outcomes, undermining the collective decision-making process and jeopardizing the fairness and legitimacy of the DAO. According to a research paper, voting power in DAO governance systems is unfair and highly centralized, with fewer than 10 addresses having full control over most DAOs. The study shows that for crypto platforms Compound, Fei and Uniswap, the community delegate vote share is low at about 10% or less.\nThe centralization issue in the voting process is further exacerbated by Sybil attacks, where individuals impersonate multiple voters to skew outcomes using the ease of creating multiple accounts. These attacks can erode trust and hinder the legitimacy of a DAO\u2019s governance.\nWhile some participants in DAOs may be aligned with collective interests and long-term goals, investors will inevitably be driven solely by quick profits, disregarding a project\u2019s sustainability and future. The intrinsic importance of tradeable governance tokens in DAO operations makes aligning financial incentives and community interests challenging, particularly in optimizing a project\u2019s growth potential over time.\nRecognition of diverse contributions\nSecure identity verification measures and a transparent governance system can solve the problems within DAOs. AirDAO, a community-governed layer-1 blockchain, recognizes the solution and aims to make decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible, fair and user-friendly for everyone.\nBuilt on its own blockchain network -AMB-NET- AirDAO offers a product suite to simplify complex financial operations. The suite includes cross-chain bridging to Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain along with a staking platform, a multichain network explorer and FirepotSwap \u2014 a native decentralized exchange (DEX) developed in partnership with Firepot Finance.\nUnderstanding the challenges of governance manipulation and multiple account creation, AirDAO implemented solutions to foster a fairer and more inclusive decision-making process:\nFacial verification: Through a partnership with Fractal ID, a provider of Web3 identity solutions, AirDAO links wallets to users using facial verification technology. The integration enables the creation of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that verify identities without requiring the disclosure of personal information or compromising user anonymity. Facial verification reduces the ability to create multiple accounts, ensures each vote is from a unique participant and promotes transparency and accountability.\nThe issuance of the AirDAO\u2019s governance soulbound token (SBT), AMB, is also based on the user\u2019s facial recognition biometric data verified by Fractal ID.\nImpact-based governance: AirDAO\u2019s system rewards users with soulbound tokens (SBTs) based on their contributions to the platform, such as providing liquidity or participating in governance discussions. SBTs determine an individual\u2019s voting power, giving a stronger voice to those who actively contribute to the project\u2019s success.\nAirDAO rewards the community for contributing to its ecosystem with impact-based SBTs. Source: AirDAO\nAirDAO recognizes that its success relies on the contributions of a diverse community. Whether users validate transactions, contribute their skills or champion AirDAO as a Governor or Ambassador, their efforts will be crowned with governance SBTs that reflect users\u2019 benefits to the ecosystem.\nA vision for decentralization\nAirDAO\u2019s Governance Working Group (GWG), comprised of around 30 community members with expertise in various fields, underlines the platform\u2019s commitment to community governance.\nAirDAO\u2019s vision is to complete decentralization and become a fully community-governed project that fosters collective decision-making within the DeFi space. If successful, AirDAO\u2019s potential to address key challenges in DAO governance could pave the way for a more equitable and trustworthy future for DAOs and the wider DeFi ecosystem.\nLearn more about AirDAO Governance Platform\nJoin support Telegram group for AirDAO governors\n#Blockchain\n#Security\n#Decentralization\n#Identity\n#DAO\n#DeFi\nDisclaimer.

The issue lies in the liquidity crunch inherent in the exposure toward stablecoins deployed through RWAs.\u201d \nAlthough Maker DAO\u2019s ecosystem is currently stable, it deems it necessary to anticipate potentially unpredictable user actions. The proposed measures include changes to Maker Vaults, the SparkLend DAI Borrow Rate, the Peg Stability Module (PSM), the Dai Savings Rate and the Governance Security Module (GSM) Pause Delay.\nRelated: Wyoming passes law granting DAOs legal status\nThe adjustments include raising the stability fees on different collateral assets registered on the platform from 15% to 17.25%.

The decision-making process is bottom-up, with a community governed by a set of rules enforced by a blockchain. Giving a DAO legal existence enables a decentralized entity to establish contracts with third parties, open bank accounts, pay taxes and meet informational reporting requirements.\nNonprofit status\nIn an analysis on March 8, venture capital firm a16z crypto asserted that there is a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding of the nonprofit designation provided by the new law.\nAccording to Miles Jennings, a16z\u2019s general counsel, and David Kerr, principal at Cowrie law firm, a Wyoming-based DAO is not prohibited from engaging in for-profit activities.\n\u201cUnder Wyoming law, both the UNA and the DUNA are able to engage in for-profit activities. This would include the operation of a decentralized exchange protocol, a decentralized social media protocol, you name it.\u201d\nDAOs are also allowed to pay compensation to their members, including in exchange for participation in the governance process, reads the analysis. \u201cWyoming\u2019s approach supports the web3 ethos, while still enabling cash flows to digital asset holders.

A unified platform would simplify the onboarding process, enhancing clarity and promoting faster adoption of Web3 use cases.\nWeb3, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain gaming, and digital currencies, is rapidly evolving. However, its fragmented nature mirrors the chaos of the early internet before the dot-com bubble. The lack of interoperability between decentralized networks and poor communication across different Web3 sectors contribute to this disarray.\nToday\u2019s Web3 lacks a unifying ecosystem, causing the market to fracture into multiple, independently evolving use cases. Crypto enthusiasts have to use various decentralized applications (DApps) and platforms to perform multiple transactions and interact with the different sectors of Web3. However, this isn\u2019t a sustainable growth model for the Web3 industry and is more of a deterrent rather than a benefit when it comes to crypto adoption.\nA one-stop shop platform could be a good start for beginners who can try various Web3 use cases from a single starting point. Such a unified experience would provide clarity and a smooth gateway to the Web3 world, acting as a Google-like aggregator for these diverse sectors.\nThe rise of super apps in Web3\nRecognizing the need for a more integrated approach, some Web3 players are moving beyond the hype. Legion Network is emerging as a notable example among these. As a one-stop shop for Web3, Legion Network addresses the complexity of the industry and reaches new audiences. It brings together essential Web3 use cases, including a proprietary crypto wallet with comprehensive portfolio tracking, DeFi swaps and bridges, engaging play-to-earn/win games, captivating quests with prize rewards, a launchpad for emerging projects and a unique SocialFi experience that fosters community engagement.\nUsers can download Legion's super app, which is available on the App Store and the Google Play Store. The app has grown significantly since its launch, with over 5 million downloads, an average rating of 4.2 stars from 215,000 reviews, and nearly 500 million game plays. These metrics underscore the app\u2019s popularity and effectiveness in engaging and retaining a diverse user base.\nHere\u2019s a detailed breakdown of the key features that distinguish Legion Network in the Web3 landscape:\nCrypto wallet and asset management: Legion Network offers a fully noncustodial wallet supporting over 15,000 tokens across over 40 blockchains. It allows seamless integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for swapping and bridging and provides features for crypto portfolio tracking and display for nonfungible tokens (NFTs), focusing on user security and ease of use.\nStaking program and Bolts system: Legion Network\u2019s innovative staking program exemplifies their commitment to a sustainable ecosystem. It rewards users with increased access to services based on their staking level, promoting a more active and engaged community.\nMoreover, Legion Network has effectively gamified every aspect of its app. Through Bolts, users earn rewards for their interactions, allowing them to unlock perks across all services. This approach ensures equitable access to the app\u2019s features, regardless of users\u2019 ability to make in-app purchases.\nPlay-to-earn/win games and quests: Gaming and quests are integral to the Legion experience, aligning with the play-to-earn and play-to-win models. Users can complete tasks and quests to win prizes and rewards, sometimes in collaboration with partners.\nThis gamification extends throughout the app with the SocialFi aspect and a raffle system where users can use Bolts earned from platform engagement to enter and win prizes, underscoring the Legion Network ecosystem\u2019s emphasis on gamification.\nLaunchpad for emerging projects: Legion Network\u2019s launchpad introduces users to new blockchain projects, fostering innovation within the Web3 space.\nLearning hub: Integral to Legion\u2019s super app is Empower Academy, a comprehensive learning experience centered around blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies and various aspects of the Legion Network ecosystem. The educational platform offers CPD-certified courses and a unique earn-while-you-learn system.\nPersonalized user experience and community building: Legion enhances user engagement by allowing customization of profiles and showcasing NFT collections, staking ranks and wallet stats. The Ambassador Program and the new Groups and Clans feature foster deeper community connections.\nLegion Network\u2019s Bluemoon, a social metaverse with NFT marketplace integrations, prioritizes immersive experiences. The platform caters to creators and businesses, providing a user-friendly infrastructure to build custom metaverse spaces while seamlessly facilitating NFT trading all within a single platform.\nIs a super app the future of Web3?\nThanks to a combination of all major blockchain and Web3 elements, including DeFi, NFTs, gaming, cryptocurrencies, social and the metaverse, Legion Network aims to create an easy access point for everyone new to crypto space and transit users from a Web2 to a Web3 mindset.\nLearn more about Legion Network\n#Blockchain\n#Adoption\n#Metaverse\n#DeFi\n#Web3\nDisclaimer.

If approved, the community would donate up to 600,000 ARB tokens in the first year, worth nearly $1.3 million at the time of writing. \nA proposal submitted on March 7 by pseudonymous delegate DK seeks to fund a \u201crobust legal defense\u201d for Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev, the developers behind the crypto mixer Tornado Cash. In addition, the funds could be used for public relations and advocacy efforts promoting awareness around privacy-preserving technologies and legal burdens for developers.\n\u201cBy rallying support for their legal fund, we aim to safeguard not only the future of privacy-preserving technologies but also the broader principles of innovation, decentralization, and individual sovereignty within our industry.\u201d\nThe proposal sets three tiers for voting under different funding levels, ranging from 200,000 to 600,000 ARB. To date, more than 80% of the votes have been cast for the highest tier. The deadline for voting is March 14.\nThe accusations against Tornado Cash and its founders revolve around the platform\u2019s alleged role in laundering over $1 billion in illicit funds, including money linked to the North Korean hacking organization Lazarus Group. As a result, Tornado Cash has been subject to significant legal actions, including its addition to the United States sanctions lists, effectively banning residents in the country from using the service and sparking controversy within the cryptocurrency community.\nProposal open for vote\nSupporters of Tornado Cash argue that the platform merely provides software for decentralized money transmission and does not directly engage in money transmission itself, which challenges the basis of the charges against its developers. According to the crypto advocacy group Coin Center, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidelines state that an anonymizing software provider should not be considered a money transmitter.\nStorm and Pertsev face several charges from U.S. authorities, including conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business.\nThe first two charges can each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while the charge for operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business is punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\u201cThese [legal] challenges not only threaten the developers\u2019 ability to continue their work but also undermine the fundamental principles of decentralization and individual freedom upon which projects with privacy-preserving technologies are built.\u201d\nThe community proposal comes just a few days after the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe canceled a fundraiser dedicated to collecting legal fees for Storm and Pertsev, citing a breach of their terms of service that could \u201cexpose GoFundMe, its employees or Users to any harm or liability of any type.\u201d\nMagazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 \u2014 The race to build safe and legal coin mixers\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest news in crypto legislation and regulations.

If you look at the first mobile apps that were built when the initial infrastructure came out, those were very simplistic sort of apps. It took a lot of years of experimentation to build something like Uber or Instagram.\u201d\nArjun added that building developer-focused scaling solutions like layer-2 rollups will be necessary to advance blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps). He said:\n\u201cThe real utility of [scaling solutions] is if developers can quickly work with this infrastructure to actually create useful scale apps that go mainstream, for example, right again right now.\u201d\nAverage monthly active developers decreased 24% to 22,411 in 2023, compared to 2022, according to a Jan. 17 report by Electric Capital. The firm attributes this drop to a record number of new developers who joined in 2022. The report notes:\n\u201cWhile developers overall are down 24%, the most valuable segment of developers (2+ year tenure who contribute the most code) continues to steadily grow.\u201d\nWhen asked about the future of blockchain scalability, Arjun said that he expects to see hundreds of application-specific rollups that will be united under a user experience-friendly app layer, much like today\u2019s Web2 shopping experiences that simplify online purchases.\n\u201cWhen you click on the buy button on [Amazon], it opens up a payment page, but the user doesn\u2019t know all the complexity behind the process,\u201d said Arjun, adding that Web3 infrastructure will need to simplify the user experience in a similar way to attract more mainstream users.\nArjun is also the co-founder of Web3 data availability and consensus layer, Avail, which closed a $27 million seed funding round on Feb. 26, led by Founders Fund and Dragonfly.\nThe funds will be deployed to help accelerate the unification of Web3 by bolstering the developments of the firm\u2019s three core products, also known as the \u201cAvail Trinity:\u201d the data availability layer, the nexus unification layer and the fusion security layer.\nRelated: Ethena becomes highest earning DApp in crypto\nExchange or buy MATIC\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this widget is not intended as, and shall not be understood or construed as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.

We are officially in a bull market.\nDuring the last bull market, developers, projects and artists all shared their lofty goals and ideas of how crypto and blockchain would revolutionize the entire world. While some of that happened, in reality, a lot was left unachieved.\nSo, now that market conditions have finally improved, everyone has another chance at delivering on what was promised. The Agenda co-hosts Jonathan DeYoung and Ray Salmond\u2019s assumption is that with better market conditions and profitable balance sheets, blockchain projects should have sufficient runway to build the products and services that hope to solve a lot of the world\u2019s problems.\nOn episode 31 of The Agenda, Salmond and DeYoung share their views on the significance of Bitcoin\u2019s price hitting a new all-time high and what this could mean for crypto in 2024.\nBitcoin\u2019s phoenix moment is a sign of a maturing asset and market\nOnce one gets past the excitement and fixation surrounding Bitcoin hitting new all-time price highs, a more contemplative mood sets in, wherein the significance of the milestone is considered.\nWhen asked about what BTC price going to the moon means in the larger scheme of things, Salmond suggested that it is \u201ca sign of maturity,\u201d especially considering that:\n\u201cThe ETFs are kind of like buyers of infinite demand, right? They\u2019re like purchasers of infinite demand. Every day for the last two or three weeks, they\u2019ve been buying $500 million minimum of Bitcoin daily, or $450 million daily. Even today, as Bitcoin price sold off after hitting a new all-time high, ETFs like IBIT from BlackRock traded like 1 billion shares.\u201d\nDeYoung expressed his perspective that, unlike previous bull markets, social chatter from non-crypto bros pales in comparison to what was seen in 2017 and 2020 and that he found himself somewhat surprised not to be looking at his portfolio value every five minutes:\n\u201cI\u2019m here for something deeper. So yeah, now that the price is back, I feel like I\u2019m a bit detached from that. And I also think that we\u2019re just \u2014 I mean, you can correct me if you disagree \u2014 but I feel like we\u2019re just still so early into this bull run that I feel like getting super hyped up about hitting $69,000 is a bit premature, I guess.\u201d\n2024 will be more about results than ideas\nSalmond and DeYoung agreed that in 2024, blockchain and crypto\u2019s success is more likely to be defined by builders\u2019 ability to deliver useful products and services instead of the value of their tokens. DeYoung said:\n\u201cI hope that it means that some of the people that are riding the wave up will then take some of their money and throw it into the more passion projects. Like they made their money with the [...] hype plays, maybe the bigger projects that make a little cash. Now they\u2019ve got an extra few ETH lying around, and they can throw it into their friend\u2019s passion project and help that get off the ground, or the kind of cool, unique use cases.\u201d\nDeYoung suggested that the synergy between crypto and artificial intelligence will continue to strengthen as the need to verify data and media becomes more necessary. According to DeYoung, blockchains seem perfectly purposed for cataloging and authenticating data, and he expects that they will play a critical role in media and possibly in government in the coming years.\nRelated: Bitcoin accumulation phase ends as ETFs fuel new $100K BTC price target\nSalmond, on the other hand, is hopeful that music nonfungible tokens (NFTs) will become a trendy industry again in 2024:\n\u201cYou know, the market blew up two years ago. So, I thought the phoenix of NFTs would be music NFTs. I really thought that that was the one kind of subsector of the industry that made the most sense and would have the most growth \u2014 it would just be easy to kind of bridge between Web3, blockchain and the traditional music industry. And there were so many platforms and people that were fundraising to the tune of tens of millions of dollars for music NFTs that I\u2019m surprised nothing has happened.\u201d\nSalmond conceded that perhaps the timing of his high expectations lack patience, something that he explained is critical in the fintech space:\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned investing in Ethereum, Bitcoin maybe, but really Ethereum and some of the other, Ethereum-like coins \u2014 one thing I\u2019ve learned about tech companies is you don\u2019t expect results at the end of one year, or even at the end of two years, or even at the end of three years. You expect the payoff and the result at the end of five or 10 years. Like ETH is clearly a five-to-10-year investment.\u201d\nTo hear more from Jonathan and Ray\u2019s conversation on The Agenda \u2014 including juicy details about upcoming episode guests \u2014 listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph\u2019s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

Booze says it functions more like an operating system with its interface, features and underlying technology rather than replacing a device\u2019s operating system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cloud smartphone environment that users can access through their current devices, leveraging decentralized cloud computing to run Web3 applications smoothly without needing local hardware upgrades,\u201d Booze explains.\nThe team envisions the virtual device as a means of onboarding users to Web3 applications and protocols previously hindered by the hardware limitations of devices.\nRelated: Solana Saga fetches up to $5K on eBay as Bonk frenzy causes sell-out\nAphone\u2019s service bypasses the hardware limits of older smartphone models by operating on a decentralized cloud-based graphics processing unit (GPU) computing infrastructure, Aethir. Aphone\u2019s interface and its applications run on the cloud service, which allows users to access apps and games that the physical device would not be able to handle.\nBooze said the virtual device\u2019s primary use case is to drive access to the broader Web3 ecosystem as smartphones become increasingly ubiquitous in emerging markets alongside the proliferation of mobile internet access.\n\u201cBy leveraging Aethir\u2019s decentralized cloud technology, APhone enables these users to experience advanced Web3 applications, NFTs, DeFi platforms, blockchain games and run multiple smartphones on a single device.\u201d\nThe virtual alternative to buying a new smartphone will cost users $20 a year. Prospective users can buy an Aphone nonfungible token (NFT), which is minted and burned on the Solana blockchain, giving users access to the virtual device.\nThe device will also provide access to several decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) operating on Solana.

In the study, the researchers identified the shortcomings of existing laws and presented their recommendations. \nOn March 7, the U.K. government published an externally commissioned research report titled \u201cIP and Metaverse.\u201d The report dove into the existing literature on IP laws and how they can apply to the metaverse. Within the study, the researchers concluded that there are metaverse-specific IP issues, such as IP governance in an interoperable environment and regulating technologies like the blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) within virtual worlds.\nAccording to the report, many legal challenges come with interoperability, including the unauthorized dissemination of copyrighted work. The researchers highlighted that the lack of interoperability has been important in preventing people from illegally distributing copyrighted material. With interoperability being a key feature in a metaverse, the researchers believe this could pose a challenge in governing the use and circulation of copyrighted work.\nMeanwhile, blockchain\u2019s inherent characteristics, such as immutability or being \u201ctamper-proof,\u201d also pose a challenge to enforcing IP laws. The researchers wrote:\n\u201cBlockchain\u2019s inherent resistance to change or correction undermines the ability to flexibly manage or update IP rights. This is an issue which becomes especially worrisome in the context of ownership disputes, as well as for navigating the termination of agreements and rights if licensors or rightholders seek to leave the Metaverse.\u201d\nHowever, AI use in the potential metaverse governance of IP also poses some anticipated challenges. The researchers argued that algorithmic management of infringements is \u201cextremely vulnerable to misuse\u201d because of the absence of human oversight to guarantee the legitimacy of enforcement.\nRelated: Majority of social media posts about metaverse show positive sentiment\nApart from this, AI-generated content also brings up another challenge for IP enforcement in the metaverse. According to the study, reliance on AI tools has the potential to invalidate claims of inventorship in content. The research highlighted examples and cases that showed that \u201conly works partially assisted by AI\u201d are able to be protected by IP laws.\nBecause of the anticipated issues in IP governance within the metaverse, the researchers concluded that there\u2019s a need for clarity on a \u201cplethora of key issues.\u201d This includes legal issues on copyrights, trademarks, patents, designs, user-generated content, virtual property and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) within the metaverse. Because of this, the researchers believed that it\u2019s necessary to formulate IP approaches for addressing governance and enforcement issues for a metaverse.\nMagazine: Doctor Who materializes in Web3: Tony Pearce\u2019s journey in time and space\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Law Decoded newsletter\nA weekly summary of the latest news in crypto legislation and regulations.

However, Coinbase research analyst David Han believes that the rapid changes in AI \u201cmake us cautious\u201d of the long-term sustainability of most AI tokens.\nOne of the primary challenges with crypto AI projects lies within the core of both technologies. While crypto projects often aim for decentralization, the current AI offering relies heavily on centralized components and data sources, argues Han.\nIn addition, most projects in the niche have failed to attract investors \u2014 resulting in under-indexed capital allocation.\nThe report highlights two opportunities for the crypto AI ecosystem \u2014 improving the blockchain data for creating human-readable transactions and analysis and helping decentralize the predominantly centralized AI infrastructure. However, Han said:\n\u201cA decentralized AI future, as it is currently envisioned by many in the crypto industry, is not guaranteed \u2014 in fact, the future of the AI industry itself is still largely undetermined.\u201d\nDespite the negative outlook, many AI tokens haverecently outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) and major stocks such as Nvidia and Microsoft. Coinbase attributed this to the market sentiment built by the broader crypto market and supported by related AI news headlines.\nAI tokens have a wide distribution of returns on days where BTC traded negatively.

Still, end-users might not reap the full benefit immediately.\nPolygon Labs VP of Product David Silverman tells Cointelegraph that Ethereum\u2019s latest hard fork, which features several improvement proposals (EIPS), will take a few weeks to fully implement by rollup protocols:\n\u201cWithin about a month and a half or two months, every single L2 that wants to use blob space as a rollup will be moved over, and then users will see the full benefit.\u201d\nRelated: Ethereum devs expect 10x lower rollup costs as Dencun upgrade hits testnets\nThe Dencun hard fork incorporates a total of nine different EIPs. The name of the upgrade is a combination of the Cancun upgrade of Ethereum\u2019s execution layer and the Deneb upgrade on the consensus layer.\nWhat does EIP-4844 do?\nSilverman explains that a major focal point of the hard fork is EIP-4844, which changes how Ethereum rollups store data on mainnet. Several layer-2 rollups aggregate and process transactions off-chain and submit a summary proof of these transactions to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one type of storage in Ethereum currently \u2014 call data storage on the execution layer. It\u2019s permanent, meaning if I post something, whether it\u2019s the image for an NFT or transaction data for a rollup, all Ethereum nodes must store that state forever,\u201d Silverman explains.\nEIP-4844 creates a new way for rollups to add cheaper data to blocks by introducing the blob space. Using call data for storage was expensive because all Ethereum nodes must process the data that lives on-chain indefinitely.\nRelated: Make Ethereum cheap again: \u2018Blobs\u2019 to be launched via Dencun upgrade on March 13\nProto-danksharding, named after the researchers who proposed EIP-4844, allows rollups to send and attach data blobs to blocks. The data is not accessible to the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is deleted automatically after a fixed period of time, estimated to be 18 days. Silverman explains:\n\u201cThe idea with these blobs in EIP-4844 is to create this brand new section of storage that I can\u2019t actually execute. I can\u2019t touch them inside of the Ethereum EVM but Ethereum, the protocol, guarantees its storage for a certain timeframe.\u201d\nSilverman adds that because blobs are stored temporarily, they\u2019re drastically cheaper for rollups and allow for the same security guarantees.\nRollup benefits won\u2019t be immediate\nProto-danksharding has been a hot topic in the Ethereum community, given its impact on the cost of rollup data storage in the future. Various layer-2 developers have touted rollup costs to be reduced by 10 to 50 times, but Silverman said the true impact will only be realized once Dencun hits the mainnet.\nDencun is set to hit the Ethereum mainnet on March 13. Source:  Tim Beiko on X.\nThe Polygon Labs vice president of Product notes that the impact will not be immediate. The Dencun hard fork is scheduled for March 13, after which rollups will have to do their own updates before taking advantage of the new storage space:\n\u201cEach rollup has to go through their own governance and upgrade procedures to change their contracts, to move from pointing to call data to point to the new blob space.\u201d\nSilverman says that Polygon has been working hard to expedite its own implementation of EIP-4844. At the same time, conversations with counterparts at Optimism, zkSync and Arbitrum indicate that L2s are eager to take advantage of the hard fork as quickly as possible.\nEthereum leans into rollup-centric future\nDencun also represents the realization of Ethereum\u2019s shift toward a layer-2-centric scaling approach. Silverman says Ethereum is looking to \u201cslow down and ossify\u201d its core components while leaving innovation and user-level focus to L2s.\n\u201cThis is an Ethereum roadmap item that says, as opposed to the base chain being responsible for scaling, rollups are really where the future is. We\u2019re going to make changes to make them cheaper and more attractive to users and be the standard-bearer for Ethereum,\u201d Silverman said.\nMajor rollup players have even begun to coordinate among themselves with the formation of Roll Call, where these layer 2s meet, discuss and produce improvement proposals.\n\u201cThese are changes that will only ever be on L2. Changes to the EVM that are not coming to mainnet Ethereum, things like new forms of account abstraction, new pre-compiles, new opcodes,\u201d Silverman adds.\nRelated: Key elements to watch on the Ethereum network roadmap\nDencun might not immediately impact rollup costs, but Silverman does expect some fanfare when the hard fork is finalized. Silverman said:\n\u201cEthStaker always does a great stream. You\u2019ll see some fun experiments at launch as well. Developers at ETH Denver said they\u2019ll be doing ETH blob Ordinals to clog up the blob space.\u201d\nAs the staggered implementation of EIP-4844 by rollups occurs, the ecosystem will begin to see the true impact of proto-danksharding. Silverman also believes that the more L2s joining the blob space will gradually lessen the impact of its cost reduction.\nMagazine: Is measuring blockchain transactions per second (TPS) stupid in 2024?

There\u2019s no other Bitcoin fork community that has any comparable metrics, any comparable community that even comes close to the original Bitcoin.\u201d\nLi added that the same thing played out with Ethereum in 2016 when new networks such as EOS and NEO attempted to position themselves as \u201cEthereum killers\u201d by offering alternative Ethereum Virtual Machine and VM environments that tried to make slight tweaks to the pre-existing Ethereum ecosystem.\nIn Li\u2019s view, the central issue with all of the Bitcoin and Ethereum \u201cforks\u201d was that they were all built \u201cmonolithically,\u201d meaning that they didn\u2019t allow for the quick integration and adoption of new technology that showed up as time went on.\n\u201cThey all built monolithically, and what happened to them, right? Fast forward again to 2024, Ethereum is the dominant player,\u201d Li said.\n\u201cWill we see this many L2s in five years or so? I don\u2019t think so. Only a few will survive.\u201d\nModular blockchains are networks that export their primary tasks: execution, settlement, consensus and data availability to external blockchains, which proponents say offer greater design flexibility.\nIn contrast, monolithic blockchains prioritize a single-system architecture, which handles all tasks within a single layer of the network.\nSome, however, don\u2019t see any reason to debate \u201cmodular vs. monolithic\u201d at all.\nMaybe it\u2019s all a \u2018marketing stunt\u2019\nAustin Federa, head of strategy at the Solana Foundation, described the relatively new debate around the two terms as a \u201cmarketing stunt\u201d introduced by Celestia.\nWhile many understand Ethereum\u2019s more \u201cmodular\u201d architecture \u2014 relying on L2s to complete specific tasks \u2014 as standing in direct contrast to the \u201cmonolithic\u201d nature of other higher-throughput networks, such as Solana or Avalanche, Federa disagrees with the use of the term entirely.\n\u201cWe have to remember that the modular-versus-monolithic debate is all a marketing stunt,\u201d said Federa. \u201cCelestia created this distinction between modular and monolithic. It\u2019s not a natural distinction, and there\u2019s nothing organic about it.\u201d\nLi claims that Manta \u2014 launched on Jan. 18 \u2014 could be described as the \u201cfirst and largest\u201d modular layer-2 network on Ethereum, as it uses Optimism\u2019s OP stack and utilizes Celestia for data availability (though Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin would say that makes it a \u201cvalidium\u201d and not a genuine L2).\nAt the time of publication, Manta is the fourth-largest L2 network in terms of TVL, only recently overtaken by the new L2 Blast, which launched its mainnet on March 1.\nManta Pacific is the fourth-largest Ethereum L2 by TVL.

As a result, the U.K. fell behind Europe, but it\u2019s catching up fast,\u201d Paul explains.\nThe U.K. Treasury published its final proposal in October 2023, outlining its plans to regulate the sector, with companies offering cryptocurrency-related activities to be authorized by the FCA.\n\u201cYou could see the latest set of publications as trying to position the U.K. level with the EU and encourage innovation so that London is seen as a Fintech center and a crypto hub. It\u2019s recognition that the FCA, Treasury and the Bank of England can\u2019t stay quiet on this subject any longer,\u201d Paul adds.\nAdvantage of coordination\nWhile the U.K. may have been slow in developing a framework that oversees the broader cryptocurrency space and the systemic role of stablecoins, Paul believes the country stands to gain from a cooperative regulatory approach.\nThe Fireblocks CBDC director says the development of regulations has been quicker in the country, given the U.K. does not have to coordinate rules between different states like the EU has had to. The dovetail approach of the Treasury, BoE and FCA has also lent a hand in creating rules that balance fostering innovation and financial stability:\n\u201cBecause of the coordination between those three authorities, it has the potential to be more comprehensive in giving a set of rules to facilitate stablecoins, allowing tokenized deposits for banks as well as central bank digital currencies.\u201d\nPaul highlights that the FCA\u2019s regime currently oversees the management and use of stablecoins in the U.K. as well as smaller cryptocurrency and Fintech operators. Meanwhile, \u201clarger, systemically important\u201d operators would fall under the radar of the BoE and its Prudential Regulation Authority.\nStablecoins remain a base asset in the crypto ecosystem\nStablecoins have become an essential cog in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The market capitalization of Tether (USDT) recently surpassed $100 billion, becoming the most-used stablecoin worldwide.\nUSDT\u2019s market capitalization surpassed $100 billion on March 24. Source: CoinMarketCap\nPaul says that dollar-backed stablecoins continue to be used as a gateway to access the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and will remain so until other blockchain-based digital forms of money are available that rival their ubiquity:\n\u201cEurope and the U.K. are saying we need to have a form of money denominated in euros and sterling, and we have the opportunity to say what that looks like.\u201d\nThe transparency of Tether\u2019s reserves for circulating USDT has often been criticized by mainstream commentators, and Paul says this narrative remains a concern for the U.K.\u2019s regulators.\n\u201cFrom the very outset, the U.K. regime said if you\u2019re going to call yourself a stablecoin, it must be redeemable at par and held in liquid assets. That\u2019s something that the Financial Policy Committee and the Bank of England said many years back,\u201d he adds.\nNevertheless, its policymakers are keenly aware of the demand for cryptocurrencies and digital money that can be used to purchase them, as Paul explains:\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a regime that encourages a safe form of digital assets that\u2019s backed by pounds rather than have a parallel to USDT in the U.K.\u201d\nWhat also needs to be considered is the use cases for stablecoins, tokenized assets and CBDCs between different institutions.\nStablecoins and CBDCs operating in tandem\nPaul authored a white paper published in November 2023 for Fireblocks, which considers the potential of a smart contract-managed system that allows a central bank to issue a CBDC as a base asset for commercial bank tokenized deposits and stablecoins.\nThe paper outlines how a country can have a consistent set of money, which protects and preserves this concept of uniformity. Paul says that users don\u2019t really mind what form of money they\u2019re using, just like they don\u2019t mind today that they\u2019re using banknotes, credit cards or e-money.\nSpecific use cases will ultimately decide between the need for stablecoins and CBDCs. Crypto-natives may feel more comfortable using USDT, while older generations may lean toward centralized digital currencies issued by trusted financial institutions.\n\u201cSome people will be for the most trusted, risk-free money. Others will go for forms of money that allow them to enter DeFi [decentralized finance], for example. Others use a particular digital currency to pay their taxes. For that reason, you will need and see various options integrating and working together,\u201d Paul concludes.\nSpecific use cases will ultimately decide between the need for stablecoins and CBDCs. Crypto-natives may feel more comfortable using USDT, while older generations may lean toward centralized digital currencies issued by trusted financial institutions. \nThe U.K.\u2019s Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Bim Afolami, recently indicated that the government is working toward passing legislation regulating stablecoins and cryptocurrency staking by the end of 2024. \nMagazine: How the digital yuan could change the world\u2026 for better or worse","article_summary":"United Kingdom policymakers are adopting a coordinated approach to establish regulations allowing cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and CBDCs to coexist.","creation_date":"2024-03-06","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Cryptocurrencies","#Bitcoin Regulation","#Adoption","#United Kingdom","#Stablecoin","#CBDC","#Regulation"],"category":"INTERVIEW","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-regulations-allow-stablecoins-cbdcs-coexist","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Bitcoin price retraces from $69K ATH as BTC hodlers take profit","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/shapeshift-settles-pre-dao-sec-case-uniswap-hits-2-year-high-finance-redefined","name":"Prashant Jha"},"article_detailed_content":"Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price recorded a new all-time high of $69,000 on March 5; however, the time above $69,000 was short-lived as the BTC price experienced a flash crash and briefly fell below $60,000.

It\u2019s integrated through AggLayer, a protocol that supports multichain smart contracts via aggregate zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs), essentially making the chains seemingly operate for end-users as though they\u2019d merged into a single network.\nAccording to a blog post from Polygon Labs, AggLayer brings \u201cuniform cryptographic security and atomic composability across aggregated chains without sacrificing sovereignty,\u201d which is to say that transactions remain immutable throughout the entire process of crossing chains.\nIn a press release seen by Cointelegraph, Sota Watanabe, founder of Astar Network, said the move came as part of Japan\u2019s national tech strategy:\n\u201cOur integration in the AggLayer and continuous investment in development solidifies Astar zkEVM\u2019s position as Japan\u2019s web3 authority for innovation, entertainment, and retail dApps, positioning Astar at the forefront of Japan\u2019s web3 expansion in the enterprise, retail, and government sectors, accelerating the growth of web3.\u201d\nAs Cointelegraph reported, AggLayer was announced just a little over a month ago with the goal of easing friction for users across chains.\nPolygon Labs compared the result to an end-user experience more in line with the internet. Instead of manually connecting, recovering and restaging assets to facilitate cross-chain movement, AggLayer basically does the connecting and converting behind the scenes. This works much like today\u2019s Web2 experience, where users click on a link and all the handshaking between sites and across domains occurs in the background.\nSandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, said in a statement that the onset of the AggLayer era was an important milestone:\n\u201cToday is an important first step to welcome communities to a seamless multichain ecosystem.

According to data compiled by Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, altcoins such as Floki and Baby Doge have returned anywhere between 80% to 289% in the past week alone, with an 840% increase in trading volume during the same period.\n\u201cThe rapid rise of assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has resulted in a spill-over effect, propelling the entire meme sector upwards,\u201d said Lee. \u201cOne significant factor contributing to the surge in these memecoins is their deployment on Ethereum and Solana chains, typically priced in ETH and SOL on decentralized exchange platforms. The upward trend in ETH and SOL prices consequently drives the price appreciation of meme coins.\u201d\nThe same day, Solana memecoin Dogwifhat (WIF) saw a wild run-up in anticipation of its Binance listing, with a gain of 400% in the past week alone. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, one trader allegedly made $4.3 million on WIF by spending 20 SOL (SOL) ($1,156) on Nov. 24, 2023, four days after WIF went online.\nWe found that @blockgraze made ~$4.36M on $WIF with only 20 $SOL($1,156), a gain of 3,773x!\n\nHe spent 20 $SOL($1,156) to buy 7.4M $WIF on Nov 24, 2023 (4 days after $WIF went online).\n\nThen sold 5.06M $WIF for $1.09M, with 2.35M $WIF($3.27M) left.https://t.co/zSCaLgF0dI pic.twitter.com/klMEzjXU66\n\u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 5, 2024\nDespite high prices, development activity continues to heat up within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The Sandbox was born in 2018 as Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies crashed in the wake of market highs in late 2017.\n\u201cWe tried to ship product updates and focus on the creator first to empower them to create new content experiences. Last year we released some major updates, including the opening of publishing on the map and we have thousands of live and playable experiences,\u201d Borget said.\nRelated: Metaverse is dead in the West, but \u2018so hot' in Asia: Sandbox co-founder\nThe co-founder added that the sale of in-game assets, including wearables and other nonfungible tokens (NFTs), was not necessarily an indicator of activity or growth of the platform:\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that people have to purchase NFTs all the time for a platform to be active. I think that is what a bear market doesn't really capture well.\u201d\nBorget said The Sandbox has been engaging with creators, companies and brands with a keen focus on Asian markets. The audience in these regions is \u201cmore receptive\u201d to Borget and Madrid's vision of Web3 and metaverses.\n\u201cTurkey, Thailand, Singapore, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and India have been a growth driver for The Sandbox, even during the bear market, and we were able to sell out all our land sales,\u201d Borget said.\nThe Sandbox carried out eight primary LAND sales in 2023, of which the company retains earnings, and i launched 17 avatar collections. Borget said most of these sales have sold out, indicating continued interest in metaverse experiences for creators and players.\nLong term plans\nA period of resurgence is a positive, but Madrid believes that metaverse platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland, which are part of Animoca Brand\u2019s blockchain portfolio, are developing a \u201cfantastic ecosystem\u201d built around native tokens:\n\u201cWe are building a solid ecosystem around SAND, with thousands of games that have been built using our tools.\u201d\nMadrid adds that conventional Web2 games like World of Warcraft, Fortnite and Roblox are living proof that successful virtual worlds have longevity that can last for decades.\n\u201cApart from being Web3 and being attached to digital ownership, it gives us a lot of optimism and certainty about our success. We are also a big company. We did several equity rounds, we have solid cash flow. We are building plans up to 2035,\u201d Madrid said.\nRelated: Here\u2019s how the World Economic Forum leaps into the metaverse \u2014 Davos 2023\nThe co-founder adds that their focus on working with brands, artists, musicians and creators has significantly influenced The Sandbox\u2019s success.

The NFT asset management platform allows users to vault and fractionalize digital assets by issuing keys that will be tradable on the platform\u2019s in-house exchange.\nVanEck, the first U.S. asset manager to file for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF in 2017, has garnered a reputation as a traditional finance firm actively exploring cryptocurrency ETFs and digital asset ownership.\nVanEck\u2019s NFT \u201cdegen\u201d\nBartlett\u2019s mandate as the firm\u2019s NFT and Web3 head is partly thanks to his personal interest in the space. Coupling nearly two decades of experience split between TradFi players Franklin Templeton and VanEck with his love of NFTs, Bartlett was given the go-ahead to build an in-house platform for NFT ownership and digital asset fractionalization.\n\u201cJan van Eck said I want you to build something, but he didn\u2019t know I was an NFT degen, so I had to start there. I put on my cap as a user and looked at the problems I encountered, figured out what they were, and that\u2019s how we formed the thesis of what we built,\u201d Bartlett explains.\nMatthew Bartlett on stage at NFT Paris in February 2024. Source: Cointelegraph\nVanEck\u2019s Web3 lead became an NFT buyer in 2017 and dabbled in the space, minting and auctioning in Decentraland. Bartlett also helped VanEck take its first steps in the space with a free NFT giveaway that served as a real-world ticket to bell ringing ceremonies at the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.\nOver the past seven years, the firm has been building what Bartlett describes as a robust digital asset team, mainly consisting of cryptocurrency investment analysts and digital asset product managers.\nTesting the \u201clock and key\u201d NFT model\nSegMint joins an array of platforms offering NFT minting, trading and management. With that in mind, Bartlett sought to build a platform primarily focused on shared ownership and fractionalization of assets.\n\u201cAs I started looking at all of the platforms out there that exist, they all sort of suffer from at least three problems. Firstly, they\u2019re custodial in nature. They say, \u2018Here are your fractions, but we\u2019re going to take your asset.\u2019 Now you\u2019ve lost out on airdrops or token-gated access,\u201d Bartlett said.\nRelated: EU remains skeptical of crypto investments despite Bitcoin ETF fever \u2014 VanEck Europe CEO\nAccording to Bartlett, SegMint maintains users\u2019 self-custody of digital assets by providing vaults owned by their Web3 wallet:\n\u201cIt\u2019s still self-custody. So now you get to also manage all of the consumptive utilities, your airdrops, your gameplay and once you lock it, you can mint any number of SegMint keys.\u201d\nSegMint keys are ERC-1155 tokens, meaning they\u2019re fungible clones of whatever is in the users\u2019 vaults. A vault owner needs to own all the respective keys to unlock it, and keys will be tradable on the platform\u2019s closed exchange.\nRelated: Bitcoin won\u2019t be beaten as digital store of value: VanEck CEO\nSegMint launched on Feb. 28 and requires users to go through a Know Your Customer process to create vaults and keys and launch NFTs. Bartlett said he hoped that the platform would attract the likes of CryptoPunks, Squiggles and Pudgy Penguin owners to fractionalize their NFTs. He said:\n\u201cIt\u2019s wishful thinking, but that is where we would start. Now you can democratize access to the best collections at a lower price point for people globally.\u201d\nThe potential of tokenized real estate\nA longer-term goal is for SegMint to build partnerships with other blockchain-based platforms that tokenize real-world assets like vintage wines and luxury watches. Tokenized real estate is another prospect Bartlett sees as having high potential for fractionalized ownership in the coming years.\nBartlett envisions a separate platform that could tap into blockchain technology for a range of real estate use cases. An example would be \u201cvaulting\u201d a vacation home to create 52 keys for each week of the year that could be traded on an open marketplace.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got sort of like a disrupter between Airbnb and timeshares where now I\u2019ve got that key, I show up to your house. I hit the RFID reader, and I\u2019m in for the week.\u201d\nThis lofty hypothetical example could be replicated for a variety of high-value assets, from private jets to collectible cars. While Bartlett believes it\u2019s an intriguing model, he admits that these types of use cases may take years to come to fruition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time for the community to figure out the best use cases, and we haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. Right now, I\u2019m in my confined box of what\u2019s regulatory compliant now,\u201d Bartlett admits.\nVanEck\u2019s Bitcoin ETF has attracted over $272 million in investments since it was given the green light by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January 2024. Meanwhile, VanEck Europe\u2019s Bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded products are also attracting interest from investors keen on diversifying their portfolios to add exposure to the cryptocurrency sector.\nMagazine: Owner of seven-trait CryptoPunk Seedphrase partners with Sotheby\u2019s: NFT Collector","article_summary":"VanEck continues to expand its presence in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space by launching its own NFT management platform.","creation_date":"2024-03-04","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Marketplace","#Adoption","#Tokens","#Digital Asset","#NFT"],"category":"INTERVIEW","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/vaneck-launches-nft-platform-segmint","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"This DePIN blockchain supports open internet access and peer-to-peer e-commerce","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/music-nfts-can-reshape-the-indie-music-industry-heres-how","name":"Janina Winter"},"article_detailed_content":"PKT is a community-driven DePIN project that aims to solve two problems: open internet access and providing a decentralized alternative to traditional e-commerce payment processing.\nOpen internet access is crucial for communication, education, and economic engagement, but remains unevenly distributed. As of 2022, only two-thirds of the global population had online access, leaving 2.7 billion without, as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) reported.\nThe control of internet infrastructure is in the hands of a few large telecom companies, often holding regional monopolies. This leads to high prices, inadequate quality of services, and in many areas, no service. Data from Broadband Now indicates over 40 million Americans lack affordable, high-speed internet. By late 2022, average internet costs had risen to around $75 monthly. Affordable, high-speed internet access is more widely available internationally, but generally there is limited availability outside of metropolitan areas.\nFurthermore, traditional internet setups are prone to government censorship and surveillance. In 2023, reports by Access Now and #KeepItOn highlighted a six-year decline in internet freedom, with governments increasingly using censorship and surveillance for online information control.\nInternet shutdowns are being increasingly imposed by governments around the world. Source: KeepItOn\nDecentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) presents a new approach for a more equitable, open and accessible internet. DePIN empowers people-owned physical infrastructure networks. This makes it possible to use a peer-to-peer mesh network to connect devices to the internet through each other, rather than relying solely on traditional, centralized internet service providers. Think of this as a global Wi-Fi network, where everyone contributes the infrastructure to create a more resilient, censorship-resistant and high-speed data network.\nDePIN to democratize internet access\nThis is where PKT, an open-source DePIN blockchain project, comes in. PKT leverages a peer-to-peer routing protocol called cjdns to create a global mesh network powered by the people. In layman\u2019s terms, PKT moves the work traditionally done in the data centers of Google, Amazon and Microsoft to the devices of both sophisticated and amateur contributors worldwide. This reduces the reliance on centralized corporate entities in favor of increased internet freedom, economically benefiting the individuals who contribute infrastructure resources to the PKT Network.\nPKT aims to democratize internet access by empowering individuals to share their internet resources and create a decentralized mesh network. Source: PKT\nPKT\u2019s mission is to enable free and open internet access to anyone, regardless of location or income. The blockchain economically incentivizes individuals to share their internet bandwidth and CPU power, which helps create a global, decentralized mesh network. To make this possible, PKT uses an innovative proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism called PacketCrypt, which rewards miners with PKT Cash ($PKT) for contributing bandwidth and CPU power to the PKT Network. The PKT Network is a VPN-based network, using end-to-end encryption for all data transmission and delivering native privacy and security.\nMining PKT can be done from any internet-connected device with ample CPU power. This empowers people around the world to participate in supporting the infrastructure of the PKT Network while also helping expand the PKT Network\u2019s reach and providing more people with access to the internet.\nA new payment solution for the decentralized web\nThe PKT Network\u2019s utility extends beyond open internet. The PKT Network itself enables anyone to host websites where the IPv6 web URL is also a PKT payment address. By connecting the underlying blockchain to the network, PKT facilitates peer-to-peer e-commerce transactions with near-zero fees.\nPowered through a layer-2 payment protocol called the PKT Lightning Network, this makes it easier for website owners to accept payments without using a third-party ecommerce payment processor.\nTraditional e-commerce payment processors often impose hefty processing fees, hold back revenue in reserve, or restrict functionality based on geolocation or local laws. PKT Lightning Network breaks free from these limitations, offering near-instant settlement cross-border transactions.\nThe decentralized nature of the PKT Network enables a new payment solution virtually immune to censorship or manipulation by governments or internet service providers (ISPs). All traffic is encrypted on the PKT Network, which protects user privacy by shielding individuals\u2019 online activities from unwarranted scrutiny.\nThe future of DePIN\nPKT is a community-driven DePIN project. Its underlying blockchain is a clone of Bitcoin\u2019s btcd code base, and mirrors Bitcoin\u2019s origins, with no pre-mine, no ICO, no founder shares, no investor shares, and no venture capital. According to Caleb James DeLisle, PKT\u2019s lead developer, the project\u2019s core objective is to change the way people engage with the internet in their local community.\n\u201cAs the PKT Network scales, the expectation is that traditional ISPs will be forced to lower subscription costs and improve quality of service in order to compete with amateur operators on price and performance.\u201d\nDePIN blockchain projects like PKT aim to democratize internet access, encourage free speech and cultivate a resilient and transparent online environment. This approach has the potential to expand global connectivity, collaboration and prosperity in a truly borderless and decentralized digital world, making it possible for anyone to own a piece of the internet.\nLearn more about PKT\nDisclaimer.

The other way of thinking about it is that it\u2019s a monetary super cycle, where the monetary systems of the world reach and end of life essentially, basically because of interest, and there\u2019s too much debt in the system because certain generations broke the monetary system and other elements of the financial system.\u201d\nLubin explained that \u201ccrypto was born into an era of free money. It was born of an era of constrained money, controlled money, top-down command and control. Essentially, we for millennia have been living in a paradigm of centralized top-down trust and its authorities imbue intermediaries with certain powers and the intermediaries help run the world, they maintain these databases or ledgers that control who owns what and who has rights and privileges.\u201d\nAccording to Lubin,\n\u201cSatoshi invented decentralized trust as opposed to centralized trust. We\u2019d never seen decentralized trust on the planet before.\u201d\nAre spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs good for the community?\nBefore spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved, crypto advocates and investors had waited more than 7 years for an approval, and while their launch may be the validation stamp that authenticates BTC\u2019s status as a sound investment, there have always been concerns that institutional investors could dilute the true vision of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.\nWhen asked whether a spot Bitcoin ETF and the possibility of an ETH ETF were good for the community, Lubin said, \u201cthere are a lot of different issues in there, but in the near term, it\u2019s a great thing.\u201d\n\u201cThe floodgates are open now, and there\u2019s an enormous amount of value piling into the crypto ecosystem.

The SEC has done some things under the Biden administration that are real headscratchers, there\u2019s an element of gaslighting and an element of unreasonableness in some of the actions that they have brought, and the judicial branch has been wonderful in seeing things clearly and making sure the laws of the United States of America and the Constitution are followed and protected.\u201d\nLubin ended with,\n\u201cI look forward to a more decentralized governance in the United States\u201d","article_summary":"Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin told ETHDenver attendees that crypto is part of the next super cycle and \u201cwe are ready for a new system of the world.\u201d","creation_date":"2024-03-02","associated_tags":["#Bitcoin","#Blockchain","#Cryptocurrencies","#Satoshi Nakamoto","#Decentralization","#Ethereum","#Joseph Lubin","#SEC","#ETF","#Bitcoin Regulation","#Censorship","#ConsenSys","#Layer2","#Gary Gensler"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-industry-momentum-is-picking-up-and-it-s-unstoppable-ethereum-co-founder-joe-lubin","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"FTX issues warning on authorized bids and asset sales","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-exit-sparks-fears-and-opportunities-in-nigerias-crypto-community","name":"Amaka Nwaokocha"},"article_detailed_content":"As the bankrupt FTX exchange prepares to settle obligations to creditors affected by its 2022 collapse, it has cautioned the public about its sole authorized investment manager.\nIn an X post on March 1, FTX said the sale of digital assets by FTX Debtors mandated by the bankruptcy court is solely managed by Galaxy Asset Management, the authorized investment manager. \u201cSeveral non-authorized third parties are attempting to solicit bids from buyers on behalf of the FTX Debtors,\u201d the former exchange stated.\nScreenshot of FTX\u2019s announcement on X social platform.

In Web3 context, RWA defines a digital twin of a traditional asset -such as real estate, art or commodities- stored on a blockchain network. Naturally, it opens up vast opportunities for businesses that benefit from migrating from physical to digital.\nWhen talking about traditional \u201cassets,\u201d the initial focus of the RWA trend, the travel industry might not be the first line of business that springs to one\u2019s mind since it\u2019s more about providing an \u201cexperience\u201d than digitized or tradeable assets. However, this $850 billion industry is shaping to become the RWA transformation\u2019s torchbearer.\nBut how?\nMost digital technologies the travel industry has been functioning on were \u201cborrowed\u201d from other industries. With the introduction of Camino Network, the global industry finally has the chance to build and control its own infrastructure. From communication to e-commerce, it has come a long way from \u201cwriting airline tickets by hand and conducting reservations by telex\u201d to using blockchain networks for better communication and faster payments, according to Thomas Stirnimann, the chairman of the Camino Network Foundation.\nStirnimann, a travel industry expert and visionary, is the current chairman and owner of Alpha Golf Travel AG. He previously held key roles as CEO and board member of Hotelplan Holding AG. Priorly, Stirnimann spent over 20 years with Kuoni Travel Holding AG, where he was responsible for the Swiss, Scandinavian and Greek markets. The chairman of the Camino Network Foundation was also responsible for Travelhouse and initiated the founding of Edelweiss Airways.\nStirnimann brought his decades of experience in travel and hospitality to blockchain space with Camino Network. Meaning \u201cpath\u201d or \u201cway\u201d in Spanish, Camino is a layer-1 blockchain specifically developed to address the needs of the travel industry. \u201cFrom the beginning, we, the founders, knew it would be a journey,\u201d he noted, \u201cBecause we all come from the travel industry and clearly see both perspectives and bottlenecks.\u201d\nHighlighting the fragmentation in the travel ecosystem, Stirnimann explained that almost every travel vertical has its own set of solutions. \u201cIt is very hard to imagine a more fragmented industry than travel,\u201d he added. Some have the legacy infrastructure, while others do better to keep up with the tech evolution. \u201cHowever, many of these verticals must communicate with each other to cover travelers\u2019 needs,\u201d he explained in an exclusive interview.\nTravel industry bottlenecks\nAPI, short for application programming interface, is the \u201cmagical word\u201d here. It has enabled interoperability between different stakeholders of the travel business and, as a result, provides a seamless experience for travelers. However, fast forward to today, it is \u201call the times expensive, many times unreliable and always in need of maintenance.\u201d\nCamino Network was born from the vision of providing a reliable, shared and affordable system that belongs to businesses from within the travel industry itself. A system designed to simplify and reduce the cost of travel operations. The inherent transparency, traceability and immutability of blockchain helps fight against fraud plaguing the key processes of the travel industry, such as ticketing and payment fraud.\n\u201cCamino Network is a travel industry sandbox. We are bringing travel companies together like never before. Our community actually owns and decides on future changes and developments.\u201d\nThis environment helps simplify complex processes like settlements, payments and verifications, Stirnimann continued. \u201cWith clear travel standards, developers can switch from maintaining countless APIs to actually developing innovative, consumer-focused products.\u201d\nCamino Network lays a solid foundation for the travel industry to operate and communicate on blockchain, and tokenized RWAs are a key step in their vision. Stirnimann exemplified asset tokenization with the booking process, stating that key components of the process -such as airplane seats or room nights- can become simpler and more straightforward with blockchain. Tokenized requests will be sent from wallet to wallet to request tokenized assets. Tokenization also brings security and transparency when making last-minute changes and cancellations, further reducing fraud.\nConversations have already started about dynamic pricing models and personalized offers in the travel tech community, and the Camino Network Foundation chairman believes that Web3 will enable new pricing models that adapt in real time to changes in demand and supply.\nFrom what Stirnimann emphasized, the main benefit of RWA tokenization in the travel industry boils down to getting closer to \u201creal time\u201d and increasing operational efficiency, which is direly needed. Because, in its current state, huge-scale facilities like hotels and airports are operated by a myriad of different systems that are barely connected, he explained. Managing key travel facilities would become much easier with real-time data and efficiency.\nReal-world assets, real-world benefits\nTurning each component of the travel business into a tradeable asset opens up doors for a wave of new investors, earning a big win for the whole industry. Tokenization can break down high-value travel assets, like hotels or even cruise liners, into smaller, purchasable tokens, according to Stirnimann.\nRegulations stand as the tricky part in the equation of implementing innovation for real-world use. Travel is global, and there is a high chance that legislation differs from departure to destination in one flight. Stirnimann takes a rather realistic approach here and admits that while Camino Network is built as the most interoperable and compliant network, there is much homework to do due to the \u201cconservative\u201d nature of the travel industry.\n\u201cSecurity and trust within the Web3 travel ecosystem is of high priority. Plus, we are keeping in mind the complexities of tax laws and respecting privacy regulations like GDPR and other international rules to keep everything smooth for the worldwide community.\u201d\nThe Camino Network Foundation, the Swiss-based nonprofit that drives the development of the Camino Network ecosystem, is mindful of securities laws to build compliant solutions across different regions, he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for Camino Network to bring innovation to the industry responsibly.\u201d\nTokenized RWA applications in travel\nWhen asked about the low-hanging fruits of RWA tokenization in the travel industry, Stirnimann told the good news that there are already some ideas being utilized by a number of businesses \u2014 both startups and large-scale companies.\nOne notable application in development by the members of the Web3 travel ecosystem is the tokenization of vacation properties, which shows how easily properties can be tokenized, according to Stirnimann. Similarly, the hotel industry is exploring tokenization to enhance reservation systems and open up secondary market opportunities.\nAnother major component of the travel experience is everything that is bookable, like airline, train and bus seats, where tokenization enables e-ticketing in the form of nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Furthermore, the main steps of travel, such as hotel nights and airline seats, can be easily tied to attractions like scuba diving or a segway tour thanks to on-chain communication, Stirnimann explained.\nMembership and loyalty programs can also benefit from converting points into digital tokens, adding value and convenience.\nCamino Network continues to grow with new supporters from the travel industry. Source: Camino Network\nWith its layer-1 blockchain designed by a team of travel tech experts, Camino Network -the first blockchain infrastructure owned by businesses from the travel industry- stands at the pole position to lead RWA tokenization in the travel space. \u201cIt is a secure place where all participants are verified. Thus, the companies can trust the network,\u201d explained Stirnimann, adding that this trust is one of the keys to kicking off the tokenization process for assets like hotel rooms, airline seats and vacation rentals.\n\u201cBy focusing on interoperability and compliance, Camino Network ensures that all the assets can be seamlessly integrated and traded across different platforms and jurisdictions. With a community-driven approach, we work closely with industry partners to set standards and practices that benefit all stakeholders and the network.\u201d\nNo more \u2018funny internet money\u2019\nThe Camino Network Foundation chairman drew a future projection where new trends emerge at the intersection of blockchain technology and the travel industry. \u201cFirstly, we will see an increasing interest in companies in tokenized assets,\u201d Stirnimann argued, \u201cAs we see, more and more regulators start considering digital assets as \u2018real\u2019 and not just funny internet money.\u201d This will lead to clear legislation and frameworks that will shape the travel industry\u2019s digitalization process, he added.\n\u201cTo predict the trends now is the same as predicting the trends of the early internet in 1995,\u201d he summarized, \u201cCamino Network is a new blue ocean for the travel industry.\u201d\nFind out more about Camino Network\nDisclaimer.

The second feature is an embedded wallet that enables developers to incorporate noncustodial white-labeled wallets into their applications.\nAccording to Coinbase, both features are designed to minimize developers\u2019 pain points regarding user experience when building Web3 products.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot from our customers in the past year, and we\u2019ve been working a lot to improve the product experience of all of the services, and where we\u2019ve arrived at is the Embedded Wallets. So, it\u2019s been really a continuous effort for the past year,\u201d Yuga Cohler, senior engineering manager at Coinbase Embedded Wallets, told Cointelegraph.\nThe move expands Coinbase\u2019s wallet-as-a-service product line, a model that allows developers to integrate digital wallets into their own applications without needing to develop the core technology from scratch. This type of solution helps companies looking to incorporate digital assets into their products and offerings.\n\u201cJust to contrast this with the self-custodial wallet model. [...] If you go to a DApp like Uniswap or OpenSea, you generally have to have a Chrome extension, or you have to visit it on your own custodial app. [...] And so what we\u2019re trying to do is provide APIs that allow these DApps to create wallets on behalf of their users, but still in a native way, so they don\u2019t have to go outside of the DApp.\u201d\nWallet-as-a-service is a popular offering in the crypto space.

Now, 64 million tokens will be released on April 15, with the remainder to be gradually unlocked until March 2027.\nAnchit Goel, head of listings at Bitrue \u2014 one of the crypto exchanges that listed STRK on airdrop day \u2014 tells Cointelegraph that the initial plan would have increased the token supply and piled on to the \u201cselling pressure\u201d from early investors and contributors. \n\u201cThis change helps maintain a more stable token value and reduces the risk of rapid price fluctuations,\u201d Goel tells Magazine.\nThe airdrop pushed STRK to a high of $7 on Binance, but it has fallen to $1.87 at the time of writing, according to CoinGecko.\nAlthough Starknet Foundation\u2019s revised token release schedule has quelled some community concerns about what could have been a massive token dump, it hasn\u2019t been enough to stop the network\u2019s leaking engagement metrics.\nStarkWare did not respond to Cointelegraph\u2019s request for comment.\nThe X factors\nTwo of Starknet\u2019s major backers, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and Alameda Research, are bankrupt. Market watchers have highlighted that investors should consider that the two firms\u2019 bankruptcy proceedings can add selling pressure to the market.\nRecent: Murder by (smart) contract: Ari Juels publishes crypto thriller\nBlockchain data shows that 3AC liquidator Teneo owns the eighth-largest STRK account, with 134.18 million tokens worth around $256 million.\nUnlike 3AC, there is no record of Alameda-associated wallets, including FTX, receiving STRK tokens, according to data platform Spot On Chain.\nThe decentralized quest\nThe project\u2019s token allocation strategy shows that the Starknet Foundation has set aside 18% for the community through rebates and provisions.\nThe rest of the tokens will be controlled by the Starknet Foundation and investors, potentially tipping the network\u2019s governance and voting power to one side.\nStylianos Kampakis, a tokenomics auditor at blockchain security firm Hacken, tells Cointelegraph that centralization is a common issue for early projects. \n\u201cYou start with investors and the insiders. Then, it\u2019s possible that token allocation can get more decentralized over time,\u201d says Kampakis.\nAmid these discussions on token allocation and centralization, the project\u2019s approach to its token generation event (TGE) has also come under scrutiny.\nHeld in November 2022, the TGE took place over a year before the broader public could access the cryptocurrency, sparking criticism that this approach benefits insiders or early investors.\nThis is ridiculous.\nThey released the token in 2/2024 but chose the time to release the TGE token as 11/2022 so that they could sell 15.1% of the token early, which normally would have to be locked for 1 year.#STRK #Starknet https://t.co/te6W0NJqG8\n\u2014 Will NG X (@WillngX) February 15, 2024\nBitrue\u2019s Goel argues that it is not uncommon for modern projects to hold a TGE before exchange listings, as it allows projects to develop their technology and establish partnerships before going public.\n\u201cHowever, considering the current dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, this delayed launch could contribute to uncertainty and reduced investor confidence,\u201d adds Goel.\nHunters and gatherers\nStarknet\u2019s recent provisions airdrop was one of the largest in history and joined the growing list of projects opting for the token distribution method over initial coin offerings.\n\u201cI still think the ICO was the easiest way to raise money, but regulation killed this,\u201d Kampakis says.\n\u201cMoving forward, we\u2019re going to be seeing more and more airdrops,\u201d he adds.\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, Starknet\u2019s distribution event may have also been flooded by \u201cairdrop hunters.\u201d\nUsers qualified for the airdrop by making five transactions worth $100 or more, holding 0.005 Ether (ETH) as of Nov. 15, 2023, and being active for at least three months.\nStarknet said it designed its eligibility criteria to exclude \u201cSybil\u201d behavior, which is the creation of multiple accounts to exploit the provisions airdrop.\nBut it appears that some airdrop hunters bypassed Starknet\u2019s Sybil restrictions.\nBlockchain analytics platform Lookonchain claims that an individual entity received more than 1.4 million tokens (worth around $3 million) in the airdrop event through 1,361 wallets.\nMeanwhile, other community members expressed discontent that the criteria may have prevented them from receiving airdrops for contributing to nurturing the network.\nRecent: Energy-efficient miners in US less likely to be impacted by Bitcoin halving\nMoody Salem, the founder of Starknet-based decentralized exchange Ekubo, said on X that 414 of the 1,000 top contributors received no rewards:\n\u201cThese are all active, productive individual users of Starknet.\u201d\nAt least 450.5 million STRK tokens of the over 700 million allocated to the airdrop have been claimed, according to Starknet data platform Voyager.\nStarknet has a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with 900 million (9%) STRK tokens allocated to the provisions program.\nWhile the Starknet Foundation is expected to hold future provisions airdrops that can include community members left out, less than 200 million tokens are left for distribution under the provisions program.","article_summary":"Over a week into Starknet\u2019s colossal airdrop event, daily active users and transaction count have returned to the baseline.","creation_date":"2024-03-01","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Decentralization","#Tokens","#Airdrop","#DeFi","#Cryptocurrency Investment"],"category":"INVESTIGATION","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/token-release-starknet-s-declining-activity","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Nokia targets \u2018broader potential of metaverse\u2019 in 2030 strategy","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-earmarks-1-25-b-ai-growth","name":"Arijit Sarkar"},"article_detailed_content":"Telecoms infrastructure firm Nokia anticipates a spike in network demand owing to upcoming advances in the metaverse, Web3 and artificial intelligence (AI) and plans to fill this gap by 2030.\nNokia\u2019s Technology Strategy 2030 report focuses on building a future network architecture to serve the emerging innovations market.

These websites have become famous for trading and establishing an informal value for the naira.\nCrypto users in Nigeria had earlier reported difficulty accessing different crypto exchange websites, including Binance, OctaFX and others. A few days later, Binance set a limit on the selling price of Tether (USDT) tokens on its P2P platform, leaving traders unable to sell USDT above 1,802 naira per USDT.\nHowever, contrary to speculation by the local crypto community, the exchange explained that the price peg was due to an automatic system pause.\nRelated: Nigerian central bank head criticizes Binance, execs reportedly arrested\nBinance is under increased scrutiny in Nigeria as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) expressed concerns about \u201csuspicious flows\u201d of funds through Binance Nigeria in 2023.

HyperCycle uses the Toda communication protocol, proof-of-reputation and modified proof-of-work, as well as Cardano\u2019s Hydra.\n\"Each and every transaction, by the way, is getting into finality in about 300 milliseconds,\u201d Saliba told Cointelegraph during an interview at the Beneficial AGI Summit in Panama this week.\nHyperCycle CEO Toufi Salibi in Panama. \nPicking up on the theme of the conference, Saliba warned that AGI could quickly transform itself into a superintelligence providing a vast amount of power to any centralized company or authoritarian country that develops it first.\n\u201cIt would be the worst thing that ever happened to humanity,\" said Saliba, who has been working in AI for over a decade and is convinced that decentralized governance is the only safe way to create a beneficial AGI.\nSo, that\u2019s the wildly ambitious aim that justifies the \u201chype\u201d part of the HyperCycle name. For now, it\u2019s a business-to-business play concentrating on hooking up AI businesses. HyperCycle nodes contain a virtual machine, transaction machine and AI machine that enable an average of 150 AI agents per node to interact and transact with one another.\nSaliba used the example of an optical character recognition (OCR) AI app encountering text in the 3,000-year-old Aramaic language. It could call on an AI service that specializes in Aramaic OCR, pay it via a smart contract microtransaction, and use the service instantly, almost as if it were part of its own application.\nHe said HyperCycle has a well-known large deepfake video app using the network. On a recent podcast, he revealed he\u2019d met with Nvidia to discuss the \u201cinternet of AI\u201d concept. He told Cointelegraph that he can\u2019t comment further on the meeting.\nSaliba explained that companies installing the nodes don\u2019t care about crypto or saving humanity, they just want to make money from their AI agents or reduce their own vast AI compute costs.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t even care about decentralization. Most of those companies are existing AI companies. All they care about is \u2018show me how I can reduce my $200,000 bill to $120,000.\u2019\u201d\nIf the network can scale up \u2014 and that\u2019s an open question since it is relatively new \u2014 one exciting but so far completely theoretical possibility is that connecting AIs to work in concert may itself be a path to AGI. Saliba believes the network itself may be a way to achieve AGI as an emergent property, where the sum of the AIs on the network is greater than the component parts.\nSaliba used the metaphor of a giant brain, where each AI node is a neuron that can fire together. \u201cThe more you have those propagated across the globe, the more likely that the AGI is achieved by utilizing all of those neurons,\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo, in that approach, the entire world has a much higher chance to get to AGI as a single entity.\u201d","article_summary":"A new ledgerless blockchain is connecting AI agents around the world and, one day, hopes they will combine into artificial general intelligence.","creation_date":"2024-02-29","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Interview","#Business","#Decentralization","#AI"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/370-k-nodes-artificial-intelligence-hyper-cycle-combat-agi-threat","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Prominent short-seller Citron targets Coinbase stock after exchange outage","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/israel-announces-plans-interest-bearing-shekel-cbdc","name":"Zhiyuan Sun"},"article_detailed_content":"Investment research firm Citron, founded by prominent Wall Street short-seller Andrew Left, has called for the short sale of Coinbase (COIN) stock following the exchange\u2019s temporary outage on Feb. 28.\n\u201cThe recent $COIN site malfunction makes the long Bitcoin/Short Coinbase trade one of the most compelling trades in the crypto market,\u201d Citron wrote on Feb. 29, adding: \u201cThis means going LONG bitcoin through an ETF and short the bloated Coinbase exchange.\"\nThe recent $COIN site malfunction makes the long Bitcoin/Short Coinbase trade one of the most compelling trades in the crypto market.

Zolciak, who is deeply entrenched in the evolution of privacy protocols, highlights the challenges and advancements in maintaining privacy in an increasingly digital age. The episode also spotlights privacy\u2019s philosophical and technical underpinnings and discusses its implications for individuals and institutions.\nZolciak explains how privacy is a right that has lost its significance because people are okay with exchanging their privacy for free services. However, the issue is that most users do not understand how much of their data they are giving up and its implications for them.\nThe co-founder of Aleph Zero explains that privacy is important in the Web3 space since user experience shapes people\u2019s approach to protecting their data. He explains that most users do not understand privacy in Web3 since the average user may be unable to differentiate between pseudonymous and anonymous transactions. Furthermore, most users do not recognize the split between privacy coins and privacy-enhancing blockchain infrastructure based on technology like zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs).\nZolciak argues that recent events, such as the delisting of Monero (XMR) by major exchanges like Binance, are a side effect of the popularity and growth of the ecosystem and the regulations it has attracted. He adds that there seems to be a general consensus that removing projects like Monero answers the increasing trend of regulatory scrutiny.

This design choice has historically restricted users\u2019 ability to transfer assets freely across different blockchain platforms. \nBlockchain bridges have emerged as a solution to overcome these limitations and facilitate the seamless movement of funds across chains. This allows cross-chain compatibility, simplifying the process of transferring digital assets between diverse chains and enabling users to move their funds conveniently without getting stuck to one blockchain.\nThe use case of bridges isn\u2019t limited to the transfer of assets between chains. It could include complex executions like simultaneous utilization of resources or functions by decentralized applications (DApps) from multiple blockchains.\nHow a bridge to Solana works\nA user can use a bridge to transfer a digital asset across blockchains. For instance, if a user wants to move Binance USD (BUSD) from the BNB Chain to Solana or vice-versa, the bridge will facilitate it. Although several mechanisms exist to complete the transfer, depending on the bridge, the process usually involves a lock-and-mint system.\nThis refers to locking assets on the source chain and minting the wrapped version of the asset of an equivalent value on the destination chain. While the circulating supply of the original asset remains unaffected, the process effectively creates a wrapped version of the asset on the destination chain, which has its own supply metrics.\nIn the reverse process, termed burning and minting, the system burns (destroys) the wrapped asset and mints (releases) the locked token, putting it back into circulation on the native blockchain.\nThough several bridges to Solana exist, the most popular based on total value locked are Portal (previously Wormhole) and Allbridge.\nProcess for bridging on a decentralized bridge platform\nThe following outlines the process for bridging using Portal.\nStep 1: Select the blockchains\nThe bridge requires the user to select the source blockchain (the chain the assets are coming from) and the target blockchain (Solana).\nStep 2: Connect the wallet\nConnect the Web3 wallet to the bridge using the \u201cConnect\u201d button. A prompt will appear asking the user to select from an array of supported wallet providers and connect it to the bridge.\nStep 3: Select an asset to transfer\nAfter a wallet is connected to the bridge, the user must select an asset from the \u201cSelect a Token\u201d drop-down menu. The user needs to click any one from the list of supported assets or search for the asset they want to transfer.\nUsually, the interface would display the balance for the selected asset, enabling the user to identify the right token. After that, they need to enter the amount they wish to transfer.\nStep 4: Connect the Solana wallet\nWhen the user clicks the \u201cConnect\u201d button, the interface displays an array of supported Solana wallets, and the user can select from the options presented.\nClick on the relevant option and follow the prompts in the wallet to connect to the bridge.\nStep 5: Create associated token account\nOnce the origin and target wallets are linked, the user must create the token account in the Solana wallet by clicking the \u201cCreate associated token account\u201d button to receive the tokens. If a user already has an associated token account, they can directly move to the next step.\nStep 6: Bridge the funds\nThe user must approve the token transfer through the bridge interface and confirm the transaction in the connected wallet. They can send assets to the bridge using the \u201cTransfer\u201d button.\nStep 7: Redeem the funds\nWhen the bridging of funds is complete, the user can use the \u201cRedeem\u201d button to claim the tokens from the bridge using their Solana wallet.\nProcess for bridging on a centralized bridge platform\nLet us understand how to bridge from a network to Solana using the OKX crypto exchange.\nStep 1: Transfer the funds to the wallet\nThe user must transfer the funds they want to bridge to their OKX wallet and then head over to the section called \u201cBridge.\u201d\nStep 2: Connect wallet\nThe user must now click \u201cConnect wallet\u201d and scan the QR code to link to the OKX wallet. To add a wallet extension to the browser, users can select \u201cOKX wallet extension.\u201d Users who are using other wallets, such as MetaMask, can select \u201cOther.\u201d They need to enter the OKX wallet password and select \u201cConfirm\u201d to facilitate linking of the OKX wallet with OKX Swap.\nOnce the wallet is connected to OKX Swap, the user can complete bridging Tether (USDT) to Solana.\nStep 3: Complete the process\nThe user now selects the source blockchain and destination wallet (in this case, Solana). They must also choose the token in the source and destination chains they want to bridge. The interface will display the exact amount of tokens the user will receive.\nSelect \u201cSwap across chains\u201d and confirm the transaction when the wallet shows. The transfer via the bridge is then complete.\nUnderstanding bridging terminology and fee structures\nUnderstanding the terminology and fee structures is necessary before starting to bridge assets.\nSlippage\nSlippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a transaction and the price at which the transaction is actually executed. Minimum slippage works in the users\u2019 favor. In the absence of flexibility regarding slippage, the transaction will be aborted if there is a price change, and the user will lose the network fee. When liquidity in the pool is limited, leaving some slippage becomes important.\nTrading route\nIn the context of asset bridging, a trading route typically refers to an asset\u2019s path during a swap or bridge transaction, which can involve multiple steps or platforms. It is important to note that swap in centralized exchanges doesn\u2019t function as a bridge but as a decentralized finance (DeFi) aggregator under the hood.\nNonetheless, not all centralized exchanges function this way. The algorithm automatically selects a suitable bridge. Some users provide users the option to change the bridge manually.\nNetwork fee\nThis refers to the cost of using the blockchain network to facilitate bridging. The fee structure is multilayered. Usually, four types of fees are levied: source network fees, destination network fees, bridge fees and conversion fees.\nA user pays source network fees to the source network to transfer an asset. Destination network fees are charged by the destination network (in this case, Solana) to allow transactions from the bridge to the wallet.\nBridge fees are levied by the bridges working underneath the swaps on centralized platforms. Conversion fees are the extra amount users must pay when switching between virtual assets during the bridging process. For instance, if a user is converting Cosmos (ATOM) on the Cosmos network to USDT on the Solana network, the ATOM to Solana (SOL) conversion will require a fee.\nTransaction time\nTransaction time in bridges depends on three variables: source network confirmation time, bridge processing time and destination network confirmation time. For instance, when the source network is Ethereum, the confirmation time depends on the amount of gas used.\nAs for the destination network, Solana is known for super-quick processing, and the funds should reach the wallet in mere seconds. The efficiency of the bridge being used is also a factor in the time taken in the bridging process.\nCommon risks concerning blockchain bridges\nBlockchain bridges deal with risks such as centralization, operational risks such as downtime or maintenance, and smart contract bugs or flaws. Some bridges rely on a centralized authority to facilitate the transfer of digital assets, which is not in sync with the ethos of the blockchain ecosystem. Moreover, like all software, bridges too are prone to downtime or maintenance.\nSometimes, when using bridges, transactions get stuck. However, reputable bridges are designed to manage such situations and will likely resolve the problem eventually. In case the transaction gets stuck because of inadequate gas, the funds will return to the user\u2019s wallet.\nExamples of hacks that occurred via blockchain bridges\nSeveral significant hacks have occurred via blockchain bridges, illustrating vulnerabilities in these platforms:\nPoly Network hack (August 2021)\nThis was one of the biggest DeFi hacks, with almost $600 million stolen because of a flaw in Poly Network\u2019s smart contracts. After discussions with the Poly Network team and the larger crypto community, the hacker eventually returned most of the funds.\nWormhole Network hack (February 2022)\nA hack that affected the Wormhole bridge, which connected several blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana, cost over $320 million. Fake Ethereum-wrapped tokens were created on the Solana blockchain as part of the hack.\nRonin Network hack (March 2022)\nThe Ronin Network, an Ethereum sidechain developed for the Axie Infinity game, lost almost $625 million in Bitcoin (BTC). The hackers started making unauthorized withdrawals after compromising private keys.\nHarmony\u2019s Horizon Bridge hack (June 2022)\nThe Horizon bridge, operated by Harmony, was exploited for around $100 million. The attackers compromised the bridge\u2019s security by getting into the multisignature wallet that maintained the bridge\u2019s finances.\nMultichain (July 2023)\nIn July 2023, Multichain, a cross-chain bridge, experienced a significant exploit, resulting in a loss of $125 million in cryptocurrencies, predominantly on Fantom. The bridge was temporarily halted due to unforeseen issues, leading to the arrest of Multichain\u2019s CEO, Zhaoju, by Chinese authorities. It was disclosed that Zhaoju had sole control over the protocol\u2019s funds, contrary to previous claims of decentralization. Currently, the Multichain bridge is inactive.\nIt\u2019s important that users conduct proper due diligence before selecting a bridge to avoid malicious actors withdrawing funds from their wallets. Moreover, keeping a separate wallet to use with bridges is a wiser approach than using the primary wallet with substantial holdings.","article_summary":"You can move digital assets from various blockchains to Solana using decentralized bridges or centralized platforms.

The data will be supported by its DEX tracking arm, GeckoTerminal. With the new integration, users will be able to access a unified API for crypto prices, market data and metadata. In addition, on-chain liquidity pool data for cryptocurrencies not yet listed on CoinGecko will also be available.\nAccording to CoinGecko, this new product update will expand its API coverage to 2.2 million tokens across 2.5 million liquidity pools. This will also mean users can access data from about 900 DEXs across 120 networks. This includes decentralized trading platforms like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Orca, Curve and Balancer. This data is now available to CoinGecko\u2019s paid API subscribers through 20 new endpoints.\nCoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong said the new update shows their commitment to empowering the crypto community with digital asset prices and market data. Ong explained:\n\u201cWith on-chain DEX data now accessible through the CoinGecko API, users can harness the information without having to consolidate from multiple sources, dive deeper into the decentralized ecosystem and unlock new avenues of product creation.\u201d\nA CoinGecko spokesperson told Cointelegraph that this new development gives users a \"holistic view\" of the market. Users can better understand broader market trends and price movements by accessing on-chain DEX data.\nFurthermore, this unified API also simplifies processes for developers. \u201cUpdates and changes can be implemented efficiently without having to modify code for multiple APIs, therefore reducing the maintenance overhead and cost.\u201d\nAs an example, the CoinGecko spokesperson explained that a Telegram bot that produced aggregated crypto prices for a token can now be designed to also share trending crypto pools on DEXs. This means that developers can update their products and further evolve them.\nRelated: 46% of largest crypto airdrops peaked within 14 days \u2014 CoinGecko\nCoinGecko\u2019s announcement follows several developments within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

Credit Suisse was acquired by the country\u2019s central bank, UBS, on March 19 in an effort by Swiss authorities to avert a banking sector meltdown.\nAccording to Ferrante, crypto can vastly improve on the shortcomings of legacy financial products, which is something that the founder will be aiming to accelerate in the future.

In its report, the company disclosed revenue of $49 million, representing a decrease of 16% compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, the firm\u2019s net loss widened to $139 million versus $91.6 million in Q4 2022. Despite an increase in the amount of computing power sold and Bitcoin (BTC) price recovery, Canaan said that its ASICs were sold at lower prices compared to the market last year. \nIn addition, the firm forecasts tougher market conditions ahead. \"For the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2024, the Company expects total revenues to be approximately US$33 million and US$70 million, respectively, considering the challenging market conditions across the industry,\" Canaan stated. During the quarter, the firm recognized a non-cash inventory writedown of $55 million due to pricing pressures.\nBitcoin has seen stellar gains recently, with a return of 144.4% over the past year. Parallel to the price increase, BTC\u2019s mining difficulty has also doubled to 81.73 trillion during the same period.

Since January 2022, Solana has seen around half a dozen significant outages and 15 partial or major outage days.\nEngineers from across the ecosystem are investigating an outage on mainnet-beta. This thread will be updated as more information becomes available https://t.co/rfeioQ6BG9\n\u2014 Solana Status (@SolanaStatus) February 6, 2024\nThe incidents varied in severity, ranging from partial to total network outages, and their causes included software vulnerabilities in the network and denial-of-service and resource exhaustion attacks.\nThe most recent outage was blamed on a bug that resulted in an infinite loop error, which caused the validators to stall on a particular block. An infinite loop error causes a program to get stuck in an endless cycle, which, in the case of Solana, prevented validators from verifying transactions on the network as they were stuck trying to process the same block.\nPost-mortem\nAnza, a Solana-focused software development firm, released a postmortem report of the recent outage on Feb. 9 detailing its cause and how validators restarted the network. The report revealed that Solana\u2019s Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation cache, which compiles all programs before executing a transaction, encountered the bug.\nEarlier, the JIT cache was implemented using \u201cExecutorsCache,\u201d however, with the v1.16 release, ExecutorsCache was replaced by a new implementation called \u201cLoadedPrograms.\u201d The new loader program used accounting information stored in a program\u2019s on-chain account to look up its most recent deployment slot and use this to calculate the effective slot height.\nHowever, this loader program encountered a legacy loader issue resulting in the JIT cache encountering a loop with older programs, causing it to recompile them repeatedly instead of efficiently accessing and executing their instructions. This glitch resulted in a network stall, as the system became bogged down in an infinite loop, unable to process transactions or move forward.\nAustin Federa, head of strategy at the Solana Foundation, told Cointelegraph that there was a process to replace the old loader system with a new motor system, but it was scheduled to be disabled with an updated version.\n\u201cIt looks like someone intentionally called that old instruction set, which hadn\u2019t been used in quite a long time but was still around in the codebase. The JIT compiler ran into issues where it couldn\u2019t find what it was looking for. And that\u2019s what created the infinite loop,\u201d\nSolana engineers quickly discovered and fixed the problem, updated the system\u2019s processes, and identified these older programs to prevent future recompilation cycles. This solution entailed reducing the deployment of troublesome legacy loaders to ensure that all program instructions could be accessed accurately and effectively without falling into the recompilation trap.\nRecent: ZK-proofs introduce security challenges for developers\nSome critics have said that a significant factor contributing to Solana\u2019s outages is the lack of client diversity, leading to potential central points of failure. Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer of open source decentralized exchange platform Komodo, told Cointelegraph that Solana\u2019s developers and validators prioritize shipping code fast over maintaining perfect network uptime, adding:\n\u201cThe key reason is centralization and lack of validator client options. Solana\u2019s ambition for high throughput and low transaction times puts immense pressure on its infrastructure, making it susceptible to performance degradation and outages.\u201d\nHowever, Federa suggests Solana possesses much more accurate architecture and explains that only two smart contract networks worldwide have independent validator clients: Ethereum and Solana. Currently, Solana has one major validator client built on one functional codebase.\n\u201cSolana has never had an outage due to a fault in consensus or something along those lines. The problems have always been implementation details. It\u2019s always been that there\u2019s been a bug somewhere in the implementation layer, which is not better or worse. It\u2019s just an important kind of accuracy,\u201d Austin explained.\nThe Solana mainnet \u201cbeta\u201d saga\nThe Solana blockchain was launched in March 2020, and over the next four years, the network has made significant strides in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Solana ranks as the fifth-largest DeFi chain in total value locked, with over $1.7 billion in capital allocated to different on-chain protocols. Its native Solana (SOL) token has a market valuation of around $49 billion, making it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency.\nDespite a magnificent track record, Solana has never officially come out of its beta phase. The blockchain is still referred to as being in mainnet beta. Beta is a term that refers to nearly finished software that a select group of users is testing before an official launch.\nHowever, the Solana blockchain is open to everyone, with hundreds of decentralized applications utilized to launch various products. The blockchain ecosystem also boasts a vibrant nonfungible token (NFT) ecosystem.\nSolana underwent brief private and public beta testing before releasing v1.0 four years ago, and today, the network processes more transactions than most other chains.\nEven though the code is still changing, Solana is much beyond what can be considered beta software. The persistent misperception results from a mix-up between pre-launch testing and post-launch software maturity and misconceptions around Solana\u2019s messaging.\nRecent: How can crypto firms bridge the gap with traditional finance?\nThe beta status has attracted much criticism of the blockchain, especially in light of its outages over the past two years. Crypto users on social media have often mocked that Solana\u2019s status as a mainstream blockchain often changes to mainnet beta and back, depending on whether the chain is down.\nSolana is a joke. Period.\n\nHow many halts have there been in lasts months? The \u201cit\u2019s a beta\u201d is not an excuse anymore. $SOL #Solana pic.twitter.com/IjvRaM58dZ\n\u2014 David Miller ⬡ (@CryptoDavid_) May 1, 2022\nFedera claimed that most blockchain systems are in beta today and that only Bitcoin and Ethereum are probably complete mainnets and explained:\n\u201cIt takes a long time for software systems to stabilize and be feature-complete as important new features are still being shipped on the Solana network. I think we\u2019re probably nearing the end of that beta phase. From a technology standpoint, one of the significant milestones for that will be the launch of a second independent validator client.\u201d\nMany DeFi proponents believe that Solana\u2019s downtime is a definite roadblock to its aim of becoming an Ethereum competitor. Still, the developers have worked to ensure the bugs leading to past downtimes don\u2019t impact the network in the future. Despite its tainted history of downtime, its high speed and low cost play a key role in attracting new projects to the platform.","article_summary":"Solana\u2019s latest outage was its first in nearly a year and around half a dozen in the past two years, but despite that, the blockchain is thriving with network activity and a token price surge.","creation_date":"2024-02-27","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Technology","#Investments","#Tokens","#DeFi","#Solana"],"category":"FOLLOW UP","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-outage-client-diversity-beta","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Ripple\u2019s XRPL taps Axelar for RWA, cross-chain communication","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-dao-removes-proposal-fund-tornado-cash-devs","name":"Ana Paula Pereira"},"article_detailed_content":"Ripple is partnering with the Axelar Foundation to add interoperability to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) blockchain, targeting the next stage of growth for the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).\nThe partnership will enable developers to use Axelar\u2019s General Message Passing (GMP) to execute calls on smart contracts residing on over 55 blockchains, facilitating the cross-chain deployment of decentralized applications on the XRPL \u2014 Ripple\u2019s open-source public blockchain.\nBenefits of the integration include unlocking liquidity for stablecoins and large-cap assets, according to the companies.\n\u201cReal world asset tokenization will be the driving force of the blockchain economy with real estate, commodities and treasuries and bonds being the leading use cases,\u201d David Schwartz, chief technology officer of Ripple and co-creator of the XRPL, told Cointelegraph.

However, in some parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia, there is a greater tendency to welcome these financial and technological advancements. \nThe Southeast Asia region was highly represented in Chainalysis\u2019s 2023 global crypto adoption index, with countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand on the brink of a crypto revolution.\nWith five countries in South and Southeast Asia being among the global top 10 for crypto adoption, Cointelegraph spoke with Nathan Kim, marketing director at Unopnd, who is spearheading Southeast Asia Blockchain Week, to understand more about the region\u2019s rise in prominence and friendliness toward the industry.\nCountries at the forefront \nLocated in the heart of the region, Thailand, in particular, is at the forefront of blockchain adoption across various industries and supporting blockchain-based projects. \nKim commented that Thailand\u2019s \u201ccommitment to fostering innovation\u201d has made it a \u201ckey player\u201d in the regional blockchain scene.\nSingapore is another country seen as a global leader in the overall Web3 space. In 2023, its central bank committed $112 million to support local fintech solutions from emerging Web3 technologies.\nDuring the last year, Singapore even saw many of the world\u2019s major crypto platforms, such as Blockchain.com, Circle, Crypto.com and Coinbase, apply for licenses to operate in the country.\nIn June, both Japanese and Singaporean regulators joined forces on the regulation and pilot testing of cryptocurrency projects in accordance with the latter\u2019s Project Guardian initiative.\nNonetheless, Kim said countries in the region still remain fragmented in their regulatory approach to the industry:\n\u201cThis regulatory diversity underscores the challenges and opportunities inherent in the region\u2019s journey toward adopting and regulating Web3 technologies. We hope that as leading countries in Southeast Asia mature in Web3 adoption, the region can create more synergy for the Southeast Asian region as a whole.\u201d\nKim said a collaborative spirit in Southeast Asia could be an essential piece to the puzzle of the region\u2019s ability to \u201cfully realize the potential and benefits of ongoing Web3 adoption.\u201d\nWeb2 aiding Web3 adoption\nKim also touched on the importance of the presence of legacy Web2 giants in the region helping to aid Web3 adoption, particularly at the crossroads of Web3 and gaming. \n\u201cThe region has witnessed substantial involvement from major Web2 companies in the burgeoning Web3 landscape, particularly in the realm of gaming. For many Web2 enterprises, gaming is the perfect getaway.\u201d\nHe gave the example of large Web2 companies like Sony, Square Enix and Rio Aisa being both active in the region and championing local Web3 gaming initiatives.\n\u201cSony\u2019s filing of a patent for NFT transfers between games and consoles underscores its commitment to integrating blockchain technology into the gaming experience. Square Enix is another prominent player, pushing into Web3 with Symbiogenesis, a gamified collectible experience,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe former CEO of Riot Asia is contributing to the Web3 ecosystem by developing a blockchain-powered MOBA game.\u201d\n\u201cThese strategic partnerships and initiatives contribute significantly to the creation of a crypto-friendly ecosystem in both South America and Southeast Asia.\u201d\nEconomic empowerment and proactive regulations\nDespite many of these countries being open to new frontiers in the fintech space, more than 70% of adults in Southeast Asia still are without sufficient access to financial services, while millions of small and medium-sized enterprises in the region face large funding gaps. \nKim explained that crypto helps bridge the gaps in the region and fosters economic empowerment of such groups, ushering in a \u201cnew era of comprehensive financial accessibility.\u201d\nHe highlighted that many Southeast Asian countries have acknowledged the potential and the benefits of crypto for local populations and have adopted policies that reflect this:\n\u201cRather than adopting a restrictive approach, these frameworks often focus on providing clarity, fostering innovation and ensuring consumer protection.\u201d\nHowever, as innovative as this technology has been for the region, there has also been an uptick in illicit activity involving cryptocurrencies.\nAccording to a report by the United Nations, the \u201cgray\u201d casino industry in Southeast Asia is taking advantage of crypto and other modern technologies.\nIncoming AI dominance\nThe emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has also been a major theme in Southeast Asia, with countries like Singapore jumping on the bandwagon to develop the technology suited for local communities. \nKim said the synergy between the AI, crypto and blockchain sectors in Southeast Asia holds \u201cimmense potential\u201d for advancing the area into a global tech hub.\n\u201cThe adoption and integration of AI technologies have the potential to drive innovation, improve efficiency across various sectors and position Southeast Asia as a key player in the global tech-driven economy.\u201d\nAccording to data from the US-ASEAN Business Council, AI has the potential to contribute nearly $1 trillion to the gross domestic product of Southeast Asia by 2030 notably for Indonesia, one of the region\u2019s largest economies.\nMagazine: 3AC\u2019s $700M Worldcoin windfall, China vs the crypto spies: Asia Express","article_summary":"The region has ambitions to become a global tech hub with a focus on crypto, blockchain and AI, as highlighted by Nathan Kim, marketing director at Unopnd.","creation_date":"2024-02-27","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Cryptocurrencies","#Singapore","#Asia","#Thailand","#Indonesia","#Adoption","#AI","#Blockchain Game"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/southeast-asia-groundwork-crypto-blockchain-ai-hub","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"This EVM-compatible blockchain seeks to annihilate toxic MEV","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/you-can-buy-an-avatar-and-pizza-with-a-single-crypto-card-heres-how","name":"Emre Günen"},"article_detailed_content":"The possibility of miners or validators manipulating block data poses an obstacle to the widespread adoption of blockchain-based products. In response, Neo has launched its new sidechain, Neo X, which aims to tackle MEV attacks to offer a secure platform that fosters trust and drives innovation in the blockchain industry.\nShort for miner or maximal extractable value, MEV is a pivotal concept in the blockchain space, representing miners\u2019 and validators\u2019 methods to enhance their earnings through transaction manipulation. This manipulation power sometimes paves the way for MEV attacks, where miners take advantage of their positions and place their transactions in front of users, for example, or purposely hold back the publication of completed blocks.\nThe exploitation of MEV has been central to several high-profile incidents across many blockchain platforms. One such instance involved an MEV bot linked to the Curve finance hack, which executed a heist of a staggering $61 million. In another example, a Solana MEV bot extracted $1.7 million using the Dogwifhat token. Additionally, an exploit targeting sandwich trading bots resulted in a loss of $25 million.\nMEV attacks threaten the decentralized and transparent ethos of blockchain, creating significant fairness and security issues in the DeFi space. An EVM-compatible sidechain addresses the challenge of MEV attacks and offers a secure platform that fosters trust in the blockchain industry.\nMEV-resistant blockchain\nNeo, an open-source and community-driven blockchain platform designed to welcome developers into the Smart Economy, has taken a proactive stance by introducing its EVM-compatible sidechain Neo X.\nEVM, short for Ethereum Virtual Machine, refers to the technology that allows Ethereum to run decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. Sidechains, on the other hand, running alongside the main chain, help expand the utility of the main network by operating as independent - but interoperable - blockchains.\nNeo enables developers to digitize and automate asset management through its robust smart contracts. It can integrate with common programming languages and tools, meeting developers where they are and providing the most feature-packed blockchain platform for building full-stack DApps. Neo offers full native support for robust infrastructure, including decentralized storage, oracles and domain services.\nHow the Neo X chain achieves MEV resistance. Source: Neo\nIn combating MEV attacks, Neo X introduces two innovative features, targeting consensus mechanism exploitation and transaction manipulation.\nFirst, the dBFT consensus mechanism, pioneered by Neo, eliminates toxic MEV from the protocol level, preventing miners or validators from compromising the block generation process. It ensures that no consensus nodes, in their rational mind, would withhold the block-producing process, and once a block is generated, there is no room for transaction rearrangement.\nSecondly, Neo X utilizes a combination of two classic cryptography tools, Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and threshold encryption/decryption, to encrypt and decrypt transaction information. This ensures that transaction processors cannot see inside the transactions, forcing miners and validators to process all transactions neutrally. This combined method is known as enveloped transactions. Similar to the transition from HTTP to HTTPS, it adds security and protects the information and the user, providing the network infrastructure for fair and orderly transactions.\nAddressing the challenges of MEV attacks, Neo founder Da Hongfei highlighted their significant financial implications. \u201cToxic MEV is a huge problem for the blockchain industry, with figures showing billions being lost to malicious miners and validators who overstep their responsibilities,\u201d he said.\nNeo Founder Da Hongfei recently announced the EVM-compatible sidechain at the finale of the Neo APAC Hackathon in Hong Kong. Source: Neo\nDa stressed the importance of the Neo X sidechain integrating enveloped transactions with Neo\u2019s dBFT consensus mechanism, which is crucial in safeguarding users; \u201cThrough this integration, we can ensure the utmost in user protection and retain the security required to ensure the successful growth and adoption of blockchain.\u201d\nThe burgeoning field of blockchain technology\nBeyond improving security with Neo X\u2019s MEV-resistant feature, Neo aims to develop the most compatible and developer-friendly blockchain infrastructure through its N3 protocol. Neo\u2019s ecosystem aims to include the tools developers need by supporting multiple virtual machines and programming languages.\nIntroducing an MEV-resistant sidechain like Neo X signifies a crucial advancement in addressing these pivotal security issues.

He invited Musk to the desktop Linux community a day after Musk complained about not being able to install Microsoft\u2019s Windows OS on his newly bought computer without a Microsoft account.\nLike Windows, iOS and macOS, Linux is an OS, but unlike most others, Linux is open-source. The Linux OS was first released in September 1991, and over the years, it has gained popularity with a niche user base. Today, popular mobile OS Android is powered by the Linux OS.\nOpen-source software has its source code available for anyone to see, alter and improve. When a computer program\u2019s source code is available to programmers, they can enhance it by adding new features or correcting malfunctioning sections.\nButerin is a big-time open-source advocate; thus, his suggestion came as no surprise to many. Many users on X lauded Buterin for promoting open-source software; however, a few others also reminded that Linux might not be the best option for Musk, given that his main focus of using the PC would be for gaming.\nIt has been a while since I've used Linux; it's great for development, but I'm not sure about gaming.

As the name suggests, a Bitcoin halving event cuts the rewards in half for miners mining Bitcoin blocks that add transactions to the Bitcoin ledger. The process is hard-coded into the Bitcoin protocol to control its supply and retain its scarcity and limited supply status. \nThe Bitcoin halving is crucial for traders due to its direct impact on Bitcoin (BTC), its market supply and, consequently, the price dynamics in the broader cryptocurrency market. This article explores Bitcoin trading strategies during the halving, cryptocurrency market dynamics, price trends, trading signals and opportunities and overall investor behavior during the Bitcoin halving periods.\nWhat is the Bitcoin halving?\nBitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers known as nodes. Bitcoin mining is the process of creating valid blocks that add transaction records to Bitcoin\u2019s public, decentralized ledger. Miners are individuals or entities that play a crucial role in securing and validating transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. In return for their efforts, miners are rewarded with newly created Bitcoin.\nBitcoin mining uses hardware to solve complex mathematical problems, which validate and secure transactions on the network. Miners use computational power and compete to solve these puzzles, and the first one to solve it gets to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain.\nThe Bitcoin halving refers to the reduction in the reward given to miners for solving complex mathematical problems and validating transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is a mechanism built into the Bitcoin protocol by Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, and it occurs roughly every four years (or every 210,000 blocks).\nDuring this event, miner rewards for successfully adding a new block to the blockchain are cut in half. For the broader crypto market, halvings reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market.\nInitially, miners received 50 Bitcoin as a reward for each block they added to the blockchain when Bitcoin was first launched. At the first halving, the reward fell to 25 Bitcoin, and subsequent halvings in 2016 and 2020 decreased the reward to 12.5 and 6.25 BTC, respectively. In April 2024, it will drop to 3.125 BTC, and the process will continue until all 21 million Bitcoin are mined.\nReducing mining rewards controls the issuance of new Bitcoin and mimics the scarcity characteristics of precious metals like gold. Bitcoin\u2019s supply is capped at 21 million, and by making it progressively harder and more resource-intensive to mine new BTC, the issuance rate slows down, creating scarcity and potentially driving up the value of each Bitcoin.\nRelated: Bitcoin halving 2024: Everything you need to know\nThe 2024 Bitcoin halving\nAlthough the timing of the next halving is uncertain because the Bitcoin algorithm governs the occurrence of halving events based on the creation of blocks, experts have pointed to a likely date in April 2024, aligning closely with the historical four-year cycle.\nThe final halving is predicted to occur in the year 2140, when the number of BTC circulating will reach its maximum supply of 21 million. At this point, no more new Bitcoin will be mined.\nThe Bitcoin halving is designed to be somewhat predictable to avoid causing significant disruptions to the network. Despite this, the lead-up to and aftermath of a halving often sees heightened volatility in the price of Bitcoin.\nWhat is the historical impact of the Bitcoin halving on BTC price trends?\nThe price trends from historical data and fundamental analysis show that Bitcoin halvings tend to impact the price of Bitcoin favorably. The halving events typically instill optimism and a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency markets, translating into positive price movements.\nThe positive momentum can be attributed to various factors, primarily economic demand-supply dynamics. The decrease in Bitcoin\u2019s supply issuance makes it more scarce, boosting demand and driving up its value.\nMoreover, the halving event draws attention to the cryptocurrency space, changing investor behavior, attracting new investors and promoting fear of missing out (FOMO), bringing price predictions by influential commentators on social media and established media and higher community engagement, which often contributes to an uptick in trading activity.\nThe period preceding a halving frequently initiates conversations and educational campaigns regarding the foundational principles of Bitcoin, blockchain technology and the economics of cryptocurrencies.\nHowever, while historical trends indicate a correlation between halving events and price increases, this is not guaranteed, and investors should do their own research to understand the price trends during each halving.\nConsistent trends have become evident in price analysis during each Bitcoin halving. In 2016, the value of BTC stood at $665 before halving, surging to $2,250 a year later.\nThe halving in 2020 occurred in May when Bitcoin was priced at $8,740. By the end of that same year, BTC had soared to $29,000. Therefore, since a bullish market trend has typically followed each previous Bitcoin halving cycle, forecasts suggest the 2024 cycle will be no different.\nMarket volatility and trading opportunities during the Bitcoin halving\nThe anticipation and occurrence of a Bitcoin halving event are often accompanied by increased market volatility. This historical volatility creates both challenges and opportunities for traders. While the uncertainty may pose risks, it also opens avenues for strategic trading, especially for those adept at navigating price swings.\nTraders can follow the prevailing trend in the lead-up to and after the halving, either to go long in a bullish trend or short in a bearish trend. Traders can identify key resistance or support levels to execute trades when the price breaks out of these levels.\nBreakouts can help signify potential trend reversals or the continuation of an existing trend. Support levels are price levels where the Bitcoin price may stop falling, and resistance levels are where it tends to halt its upward movement.\nTraders can identify these levels using technical analysis tools like trendlines, moving averages or horizontal support and resistance lines, waiting for the price to break decisively above a resistance level or below a support level. The breakout is confirmed when the price closes above or below the identified level, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment.\nFor example, in 2016, before the halving, Bitcoin\u2019s price was trading at around $665. Traders observing a resistance level at $700 may have adopted a breakout strategy, and if the price broke decisively above $700, it could signal a bullish breakout.\nOnce the breakout is confirmed, traders may enter a long position (buy) if it is a bullish breakout or a short position (sell) if it is a bearish breakout. Stop-loss orders and take-profit levels are typically set to manage risk and secure profits.\nTraders should continue to monitor the trade, adjusting their strategy as the market evolves. Breakout trades aim to capture the momentum generated by the price breaking through a significant level.\nBreakout trading carries risks, and false breakouts can occur. Therefore, traders must exercise caution and do their research to filter out potential false breakouts.\nAdditionally, traders can explore price differentials across various crypto exchanges. Bitcoin\u2019s volatility may create temporary pricing imbalances, and traders can capitalize on these arbitrage opportunities by buying on one exchange and selling on another.\nRelated: Bitcoin halving 2024 \u2014 Miners predict potential outcomes of reduced BTC rewards\nRisk assessment during the Bitcoin halving\nAlthough the Bitcoin halving is commonly perceived as a positive occurrence, there are inherent risks, particularly in the short term. The period leading up to the halving often triggers speculative market behavior, introducing the potential for heightened volatility.\nAdditionally, it is crucial to recognize the possibility of a bear trend or temporary price corrections if market expectations are not aligned with the actual outcomes. Furthermore, traders must ensure that their cryptocurrency holdings are stored securely. Consider using a hardware wallet or a secure software wallet and enable two-factor authentication for added security.\nMarket sentiment, regulatory developments, and global economic factors can contribute to the overall risk landscape associated with the Bitcoin halving, emphasizing the importance of a well-informed and adaptable approach to investment strategies.\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

By taking advantage of Web3 and artificial intelligence (AI), Day By Day aims to deliver the way to more inclusive and democratized insurance.\nDespite its long history of providing financial security, the traditional insurance sector grapples with efficiency, transparency and security problems. As identified in the Aon report, the industry struggles to adapt to changing consumer behaviors, and challenges like demographic shifts and rising healthcare costs remain. Regulatory burdens are another issue, as highlighted by 80% of insurance CEOs believing over-regulation threatens growth.\nBlockchain stands as a beacon of hope in response to the inherent challenges of the insurance industry. Unlike traditional methods that rely on cumbersome paperwork and subjective assessments, blockchain promises to redefine the landscape of insurance through transparency, efficiency, security and accessibility.\nBuilding on the foundation laid by blockchain, the integration of real-world assets (RWAs) and AI further amplifies the potential for transformative change, enabling more nuanced risk assessments and personalized insurance products. Projects that leverage these technologies have a chance at overcoming historical challenges that have long plagued the insurance industry.\nThe monetization of insured assets\nDay By Day, a multichain Web3 insurance platform powered by AI, wants to revolutionize the insurance sector by combining the power of blockchain, RWAs and AI. The platform's users can secure their assets with an asset register app available on Google Play and the App Store.\nUpon creating an account, users can document their assets via photographs within the platform's proof-of-ownership consensus model. Users receive the platform's native digital asset, the DBD token, as a reward for every asset they register. The platform encourages holding DBD tokens with additional rewards and introduces the opportunity to purchase gift cards directly through the asset register app.\nDay By Day transforms nonfungible tokens (NFTs) into tangible insurance policy instruments. With this approach, individuals can hold NFTs as a means of securing insurance coverage and as an investment. Owners of policy NFTs with matching features also receive a share of the premiums collected from customers. Day By Day enables users to burn DBD tokens, effectively reducing the total supply in exchange for discounted rates on NFT policies.\nAt the heart of Day By Day\u2019s structure is the Underwriting DeFi Pool model, which aims to act as a safeguard against unexpected events. The model allocates a significant portion of insurance premiums into accessible and locked liquidity pools. Pool contributors receive DBD-LP tokens, representing a stake that can be actively traded.\nThis approach ensures that half of the underwriting is always secured, protecting against smart contract vulnerabilities. Day By Day envisions the concept of underwriting as a chance, stating: \u201dImagine everyone having the opportunity to invest like \u2018Warren Buffett\u2019 does in underwriting.\u201d\nDay By Day simplifies insurance with its easy-to-use app. Source: Day By Day\nAfter an extensive four-and-a-half-year development period, Day By Day has achieved several milestones, including the launch of its DBD token, the launch of its mobile app to register real-world assets, NFTs as insurance policies for anyone to own, DeFi underwriting to cover claims and the introduction of native staking on the Polygon and Algorand networks. Day By Day's goal is to expand its vision to include digital asset protection for health, life, travel and niche markets supported by Web3 and AI.\nDecentralized insurance control\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sell insurance,\u201d said Bill Angelidis, CEO and founder of Day By Day, while encapsulating the ethos of Day By Day, adding:\n\u201cPeople come to us to get protection for real-world assets that are valuable to them in a transparent, on-demand, personalized way like never before.\u201d\nSupporting the CEO\u2019s words, Day By Day is developing its Asset Protection Coverage feature. With this coverage system, customers will be able to choose the assets they want to protect, the events they want to preserve and the period they wish to cover.\nAdditionally, Day By Day plans to implement a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) project in the near future to democratize the insurance industry by giving all control authority to users.\nThe integration of cutting-edge technologies such as Web3 and AI, as showcased by innovative platforms like Day By Day, equips the insurance industry with tools to empower consumers and democratize access. This evolution paints the picture of a future where insurance is not only more transparent and personalized but also widely accessible, heralding a new era of consumer empowerment and industry innovation.\nLearn more about Day By Day\nDisclaimer.

Miners can start mining cryptocurrencies using hardware like a central processing unit (CPU) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Alternatively, they can use smartphones powered by Android and iOS systems to mine the cryptocurrencies of their choice.\nWhile technically possible, mining cryptocurrencies on smartphones is generally impractical and inefficient. So, how about an innovative approach to mining and network infrastructure via a decentralized wireless network? Strange as it may sound, miners can mine cryptocurrencies without relying on expensive infrastructure. Helium Network has made it possible by allowing nodes to act as hotspot devices.\nThis article will discuss the Helium ecosystem, Helium mining, the HNT hotspot miner and how a Helium miner works.\nWhat is the Helium network?\nHelium is a dispersed network of hotspots that offers LoRaWAN-capable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, a long-range wireless service publicly accessible by global citizens. LoRaWAN stands for Long Range Wide Area Network, and IoT devices may communicate with one another via LoRa thanks to the open LoRaWAN protocol. IoT devices are smart \u201cgadgets\u201d that connect to a network and exchange data, offering a more comprehensive range of connectivity than WiFi.\nHelium blockchain was developed exclusively to encourage the development of real, decentralized wireless networks. Helium uses HNT (Helium) tokens as its primary cryptocurrency. However, the project migrated to the Solana blockchain in April 2023. \nThis move made HNT natively compatible with projects \u2014 i.e., interoperability \u2014 within the Solana ecosystem while jacking up the utility of MOBILE and IOT tokens (other Helium tokens). MOBILE tokens aim to make creating and operating decentralized wireless networks seamless, with a particular emphasis on 5G and cellular services. By providing incentives for establishing and maintaining mobile data transmission infrastructure, MOBILE tokens allow for a decentralized method of cellular access. \nThe purpose of IOT tokens is to facilitate the IoT component of the Helium network. They ensure robust and extensive coverage for low-power Internet of Things devices by encouraging and facilitating the operation of LoRaWAN hotspots and related services. The IOT tokens greatly enhance the network\u2019s utility and reach for IoT applications.\nFurthermore, Solana\u2019s architecture makes faster transaction speeds and more efficiency possible, incorporating innovations like proof-of-history (PoH). This is advantageous for the real-time needs of IoT devices and networks.\nHotspots and network participation\nWith Helium, anyone can own and manage a wireless IoT network using a unique, portable radio router known as a hotspot. Hotspots are wireless plug-and-play devices that offer superior connectivity to WiFi. \nHotspots are used by miners to build \u201cThe People\u2019s Network,\u201d a long-range wireless network that provides coverage for IoT devices with meager power requirements in exchange for HNT, the Helium blockchain\u2019s native cryptocurrency. The Helium community has permitted third-party manufacturers to sell a range of Helium hotspots.\nProof-of-coverage (PoC) mechanism\nProof-of-coverage (PoC), a novel work algorithm, is used by the Helium blockchain to confirm that hotspots accurately describe their location and the wireless network coverage they are generating from it. Radio waves are used during the mining process, and hotspots are rewarded for acting as witnesses for peers\u2019 performance, completing PoC challenges and sharing device data. The most valuable tool for viewing data linked to PoC is the Helium Network Explorer.\nWhen the Helium network debuted in 2019, it employed a PoC system based on a sophisticated model comprising Challenger, Beaconer, Witness, Validator and Rewarder roles. This model aimed to accurately validate the geographical locations of hotspots and the corresponding wireless coverage they provided. As the network expanded rapidly and diversified, the complexity and sophistication of attempts to exploit the system increased, necessitating adaptations to maintain integrity and effectiveness.\nAs a result, Helium Improvement Proposal 70 introduced an oracle-based PoC system to streamline the process. In this system, hotspots are responsible for their own beacon transmissions, and a decentralized group of oracles validates PoC events. This reduces the network\u2019s overhead and improves scalability and efficiency.\nAdvantages of the Helium Network\nPros of the Helium Network over a standard internet service provider include a high level of security, complete encryption and affordable universal internet access. Moreover, Helium\u2019s decentralized architecture leverages the shared infrastructure of hotspots run by businesses and consumers to offer more affordable connection solutions, especially for IoT devices. This may make accessing the internet more accessible for those in rural or underserved areas.\nAdditionally, users do not need to bear charges that a cellular provider might impose, such as coverage fees or the cost of extra hardware like a SIM card. That said, users only pay for the data they used to connect their devices \u2014 i.e., pay-per-use \u2014 using the Helium Console to begin using the Helium Network.\nHelium supports cutting-edge technologies like LoRaWAN for low-power devices, making it an ideal platform for many IoT applications, from smart agriculture to urban planning. Also, Helium empowers its users to be a part of the network\u2019s expansion, offering incentives for hotspot hosts in the form of HNT rewards. This community-driven approach fosters a collaborative ecosystem.\nWhat is a Helium miner?\nUtilizing specialized hardware known as hotspots, Helium miners offer the Helium network wireless network coverage. By acquiring or constructing a WHIP-compliant hotspot and staking a token deposit corresponding to the density of other miners operating in their area, users become miners on the Helium network. WHIP stands for Wireless Hardware Interface Protocol.\nIn addition to the blockchain protocol, the Helium Wireless protocol called WHIP, a network of independent providers rather than a single coordinator, offers a bi-directional data transfer method between wireless devices and the internet. \nThe responsibility of validating hotspots to ensure that device data reaches its intended destination and that miners receive compensation for their services lies with internet applications known as routers \u2014 aka Helium Network servers. These routers purchase encrypted device data from miners, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of data transmission within the network.\nIn the Helium network, hotspots are of three types, as explained below:\nFull hotspots: These hotspots maintain a full copy of the HNT blockchain and receive rewards for all participation activities, including proof-of-coverage and data transfer.\nLight hotspots: With the help of the Light Hotspot software, these hotspots use validators to participate as full hotspots without incurring the additional costs of keeping a local copy of the blockchain. In addition, they are rewarded for proof-of-coverage and data transfer activities.\nData-only hotspots: These hotspots provide data transfer capabilities for the network without participating in PoC challenges. As a result, they are rewarded for data transfer activities only.\nHow does Helium mining work?\nRadiowave technology is utilized to carry out Helium mining instead of CPUs or ASICs. In addition, blockchain technology is used to create a wireless network that is more reliable than the network provided by established traditional wireless service providers. However, it is important to note that reliability can be subjective and context-dependent, varying based on network density, hotspot distribution and other factors.\nHelium hotspots or miners provide long-range wireless coverage using special devices called LoRaWAN transmitters. So, how can one earn Helium tokens in return? By mining and expanding The People\u2019s Network\u2019s coverage with suitable hotspots, miners gain HNT. The reward amount is correlated with the data a miner will transfer \u2014 i.e., more money when miners transfer more device data. Other factors influencing HNT rewards include the number of devices served and the miner\u2019s participation in PoC challenges. \nIn addition, the network automatically and randomly assigns proof-of-coverage tests to verify the location of hotspots (witnesses). Hotspots get directives or \u201cchallenges\u201d from validators to communicate payloads to any nearby hotspots for observation and verification to participate in PoC. These difficulties are also referred to as \u201cbeacons.\u201d However, as they can only mine HNT for data transfers and cannot have their beacons confirmed, HNT hotspot miners without neighbors get paid less.\nMoreover, each compatible device needs data credits (DCs) to send data to the internet. DCs are created by burning HNT to achieve a burn and mint equilibrium (BME), which ensures a balance between the creation of new HNT through mining and the removal of HNT from circulation through the burning process. The BME model uses tokens as a proprietary form of payment, but customers who wish to use a service do not directly pay a counterparty. Instead, they burn tokens. \nHow to set up a Helium miner?\nAs mentioned in the above sections, a hotspot miner, antenna (and its location), cables, smartphone and router are the prerequisites to set up a Helium miner. But how does one find the best Helium miner? The position of antennas and one\u2019s geographical location play a key role in finding a suitable Helium miner. The below steps provide an understanding of how one can set up a Helium miner:\nStep 1: Download and set up a Helium app\nThe first step involves downloading the Helium app (available for Android and iOS) and setting up an account. After this, a Helium wallet will be generated that users can utilize to store their information.\nThe application will generate a 12-word seed phrase to back up the Helium wallet. The app will also prompt the user to create a six-digit PIN that must be entered each time when logging in as an additional security measure. \nStep 2: Add a Helium miner\nThe next step is to find out the plus (+) symbol to add a Helium miner, for example, the RAK Hotspot Miner, to the app. The chosen miner needs to be plugged in to operate, and a tiny red light will confirm that it is working. Then, a button on the back of the device needs to be pressed for Bluetooth pairing. Alternatively, WiFi can be configured by choosing from the available network settings in the Helium app. \nIt should be noted that it is essential to choose a Helium miner that is reliable and approved by the Helium community. Potential buyers should look for hotspots that are compatible with their region\u2019s frequency and have a good track record of performance and support.\nStep 3: Select the hotspot, verify its location, and set up the antenna\nNow, the list will include the chosen Hotspot Miner. To proceed, the user selects \u201cHotspot.\u201d A prompt to add a hotspot will then appear. The user adds the hotspot, verifies the hotspot\u2019s location, and configures the antenna.\nThe first assertion is free (paid by manufacturers), and users are responsible for paying the transaction fee (in HNT) for further assertions. If the user still needs to get ready to set a location, they can press \u201cSkip.\u201d If you are good to go, select \u201cContinue.\u201d The added Hotspot can be viewed and managed under the Hotspots tab of the mobile app.\nAfter the hotspot is added and its location is asserted, it will begin to participate in the network activities, including PoC challenges and data transfer, earning HNT based on its performance.\nHow to optimize your Helium miner setup\nThe goal of optimizing a Helium miner setup is to maximize the radio frequency signal reach of the hotspot. Orienting the antenna to its highest point \u2014 ideally outside or close to a window \u2014 will help it stay clear of obstacles and improve its line of sight to neighboring hotspots. \nThe power and coverage of the signal can be greatly increased by using a high-gain antenna compatible with the frequency band used in the area. For the antenna to be protected from static damage and lightning strikes, it must be properly grounded. \nFurthermore, updating the firmware of the hotspot to the most recent version ensures the best performance and security. In addition, it is crucial to consider the density of hotspots in the area; too close may result in signal overlap, while too far may make it impossible to take part in PoC challenges. Effective management of these factors can substantially boost the effectiveness and earnings of a Helium miner setup.\nThe future of the Helium network\nThe future of the Helium network looks promising, with its migration to Solana offering users enhanced support through both hardware and software wallets and integration with a wide array of Solana ecosystem applications. Despite the migration, HNT, MOBILE and IOT tokens retain their significance within the Helium ecosystem, unaffected by Solana\u2019s native SOL (SOL) token.\nThe introduction of 5G and the transition to Solana as the primary blockchain layer have not altered the dynamics between MOBILE and HNT tokens. 5G hotspot owners will continue earning MOBILE tokens, while HNT holders can still stake their tokens. \nThe Helium network\u2019s IoT and 5G segments are poised for growth, benefiting from the increased reliability and scalability offered by the new architecture. Innovations like the Solana Mobile Stack and Saga Phone are set to enrich the mobile experience within the ecosystem, further expanding Helium\u2019s capabilities and reach.","article_summary":"Explore Helium miner, a decentralized device that earns cryptocurrency by providing IoT network coverage and validating transactions.","creation_date":"2024-02-23","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Cryptocurrencies","#Mining","#Internet of Things","#How to"],"category":"HOW TO","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-a-helium-miner-and-how-does-it-work","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Axie Infinity co-founder loses $9.7M in 3,248-ETH wallet hack","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-earmarks-1-25-b-ai-growth","name":"Arijit Sarkar"},"article_detailed_content":"Two crypto wallet addresses belonging to Jeff \u201cJihoz\u201d Zirlin, one of the five co-founders of Axie Infinity and Ronin Network, were hacked, and roughly $9.7 million worth of Ether (ETH) was stolen and siphoned across Tornado Cash. \nOn Feb. 23, blockchain investigator PeckShield alerted about a \u201cwhale wallet\u201d compromise over the Ronin Bridge, reporting that the hacker made away with 3,248 ETH.

United States Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu gave opening remarks at the meeting and shared thoughts on cooperation and collaboration in global supervisory activities.\nHsu devoted much of his short talk to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), an international bank that closed in 1991 after a seven-country operation against its money laundering and other financial crimes. Before its closure, BCCI had offices in over 72 countries. Hsu said:\n\u201cThe BCCI story has parallels to FTX and other failed crypto-asset intermediaries.\u201d\nLike BCCI, FTX had no single supervisor, and its parent holding company was not subject to regulation in the jurisdiction where it was chartered. The collapse of BCCI led to enhanced supervision of international banks, Hsu said.

This concluded a year where the company mined 12,852 BTC in total, representing more than half a billion dollars.\nThe halving\nThere\u2019s a ticking clock counting down to the next Bitcoin halving, which is predicted to happen somewhere around the third week of April. This prediction is based on the remaining number of blocks and the average time it currently takes to mine them.\nWhile most analysts are predicting a follow-on price increase for the Bitcoin asset, there\u2019s a significant amount of uncertainty surrounding how the halving will affect miners.\nTraditionally, Bitcoin has experienced periods of sharp incline post-halving. But, as the term \u201chalving\u201d implies, the payouts for mining a block on the Bitcoin blockchain will be reduced by 50% \u2014 taking them down from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block.\nMining after April\nThe tumultuous period surrounding previous halvings has resulted in a rebalancing for the field in the past, with some miners shifting toward other cryptocurrencies. However, it bears mention that Marathon Digital reportedly holds over 15,000 BTC as part of a war chest worth over $1 billion.\nMarathon Digital Holdings\u2019 December 2023 #Bitcoin Production Update is here:\n\n- Record BTC Production of 1,853 BTC in December and 12,852 in 2023\n- Increased Average Operational Hash Rate 18% M/M to 22.4 EH/s\n- BTC Holdings Now Over 15,000, Total Cash & BTC of $1.0B as of\u2026\n\u2014 Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA) (@MarathonDH) January 4, 2024\nWhile some analysts predict close United States competitor Riot Platforms may be better positioned to come out ahead in the long run, Marathon has ironically taken a commanding lead in the early sprint leading up to April.","article_summary":"The new service should speed things up for large and/or non-standard Bitcoin transactions.","creation_date":"2024-02-22","associated_tags":["#Bitcoin","#Blockchain","#Mining","#Business","#Bitcoin Mining","#Halving","#Bitcoin Halving"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/marathon-digital-holdings-launches-direct-bitcoin-btc-transaction-submission-service","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Empirical analysis identifies blockchain as highest-performing information security startup investment","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/futureverse-studios-debuts-trailer-web3-readyverse-battle-royale-game","name":"Tristan Greene"},"article_detailed_content":"A team of Swiss researchers, under grant from Switzerland\u2019s Cyber-Defence Campus, recently published an empirical study showing blockchain as the top performer among information security startup investments. \nThe study, titled \u201cMeasuring the performance of investments in information security startups: An empirical analysis by cybersecurity sectors using Crunchbase data,\u201d identifies and ranks 19 information security startup sectors ranging from artificial intelligence to spam filtering.\nAccording to the researchers:\n\u201cWe find the blockchain sector to have the highest expected annual arithmetic (AAR) and log returns at 177.27% and 105.42%, respectively, consistent with the performance of cryptocurrencies over the sample period.\u201d\nSimply put, investments in blockchain security startups had higher returns than artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, cloud and other sectors by a significant margin. AI was second, with expected annualized arithmetic returns of 67.25%.\nIt bears mention that these figures don\u2019t represent the broader AI and tech sectors, which include non-security hardware and software products and services such as Nvidia\u2019s GPUs and OpenAI\u2019s GPT tech.\nFocusing specifically on security sector investments, not only does blockchain take the top spot for returns, it\u2019s also the fastest. Whereas blockchain startups on average went from their first recorded funding round to their initial public offering (IPO) in less than three and a half years, those in other sectors averaged between four and seven years, with e-signature startups taking 10.\nRelated: Ondo Finance eyes tokenized treasury expansion amid crypto bull market\nThe study relied on Crunchbase data, which, according to the researchers, featured exhaustive data on funding rounds but lacked some entries for IPOs. To compensate for the missing data, the researchers \u201cused a machine learning approach.\u201d\nThe team also writes that blockchain security startup performance \u201cis likely to be driven by investors\u2019 interest in cryptocurrencies.\u201d Thus, it should be mentioned that the data used in the study only covered periods from 2010 to 2022.

The project currently has a diluted market cap of $2.65 billion. Last September, Pixel announced its migration from Polygon to Sky Mavis\u2019 Ronin Web3 gaming blockchain, citing the latter\u2019s dedicated gaming user base. \nAs per data from DappRadar, there are currently 531,850 wallets interacting with the social community game, representing an increase of 47.9% over the past 30 days. Pixels is a laid-back adventure game where one can farm, explore, own land, and flex nonfungible tokens (NFTs) within the community. However, Berry, the protocol\u2019s in-game token, has not kept up with the Pixel token\u2019s surge, resulting in a much lower value in terms of gaming transactions. \nBig day.

Meanwhile, the blockchain\u2019s total value locked has also recovered to $214 million, with 99% of its volume contributed by the native decentralized exchange Katana. \nOn Feb. 5, the Ronin (RON) token was also listed on Binance but quickly declined after an accumulation of RON by insiders, who then swiftly sold after the actual token was listed, driving down its price. Yi He, co-founder of Binance and spouse of former CEO Changpeng Zhao, explained after the fiasco that the exchange would impose more stringent internal controls to separate the listing team from project research teams to prevent information leaks. \nIn an interview with Cointelegraph, Aleksander Larsen, co-founder of Sky Mavis, explained that Ronin will allow Web3 games that gain traction to be integrated into the Mavis Hub, the protocol\u2019s Steam-like platform for game curation.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Nathan Allman, CEO of Ondo Finance, said that tokenized treasuries can have several advantages over simply holding the underlying treasuries themselves.\n\u201cTokenized treasuries can be transferred on-chain, 24/7, including in decentralized and centralized exchanges and over-the-counter,\" said Allman. \u201cThey can also interact with smart contracts, unlike Treasurys held in a traditional brokerage account, allowing investors to take advantage of DeFi while earning sustainable yield.\"\n\"Flux [Ondo's DeFi protocol] is a perfect example, where peer-to-pool lending with algorithmically determined interest rates can take place with no intermediation.\"\nOndo has three products: OUSG, which provides exposure to U.S. Treasurys; OMMF, which provides exposure to U.S. money market funds; and USDY, providing a yield-bearing alternative to conventional stablecoins that are comprised of short-term Treasurys and bank deposits. The pools have around $186 million in total value locked and possess an annual yield of around 5%. Their underlying assets, the U.S. Treasurys, are guaranteed by the United States government, with revenue from sources such as income tax and corporate taxes paying for its interest expenses. \n\"Cash [Treasury] equivalents are only the first step and we\u2019ll be announcing soon our plans to bring the other $100T+ of securities on-chain,\" Allman told Cointelegraph. \"We are also looking to address core infrastructure-layer challenges to accelerate the large-scale creation and use of tokenized securities on public blockchains.\"\nCurrently, Ondo's tokenized assets are not available to U.S. investors due to a lack of regulatory clarity in the country. Non-U.S. users who wish to invest in Ondo\u2019s treasury pools must first pass a Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering verification check and hold the tokenized assets for at least 40 days before transferring them. \u201cWhile there are no dedicated regulations for tokenized assets, the current form of products available in the tokenized market is structured in a way that it can be sufficiently covered under existing regulations and exemptions [outside the U.S.],\u201d Allman stated.\nHong Kong is one such jurisdiction where regulators are keen on onboarding real-world asset tokenizers. In a letter on Feb. 20, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority outlines principles of governance and risk management, asset segregation, outsourcing, disclosure, and Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism for tokenization firms. The new rules are expected to take effect in August. \nRelated: Real-world asset protocols outperform DeFi blue chips due to tokenization wave","article_summary":"The tokenization protocol opened its first Hong Kong office last month.","creation_date":"2024-02-22","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Cryptocurrencies","#Bonds","#DeFi"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ondo-finance-eyes-tokenized-treasury-expansion-amid-crypto-bull-market","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Social is the future of trading: MC² Finance connects with the best strategy experts","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-forensics-beyond-analytics-how-bitscrunch-aims-to-be-the-one-stop-shop-for-digital-asset-data","name":"Victoria Li"},"article_detailed_content":"\u201cWe\u2019ve built the real bridge between traditional finance and DeFi. Our solution allows anyone to create digital asset portfolios in a matter of seconds. I\u2019m sure many people have experienced the complexity of the digital asset world, especially if you\u2019re trying to build a strong portfolio,\u201d said Marine Popoff introducing MC² Finance. The platform was the central topic of the recent Cointelegraph Twitter Spaces session.\n🎙️ We're live! 💥 Join the conversation with Christoph Richter and Marine Popoff as we break down decentralized finance, copy trading, and more. 👇 https://t.co/72CjAQYODK\n\u2014 Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) February 14, 2024\nCo-founded by Popoff and Christoph Richter, MC² Finance is an infrastructure for instant, noncustodial digital asset portfolios. It facilitates the trading and backing of comprehensive investment strategies rather than individual tokens. MC² Finance is also a participant in the Tenity Global Acceleration Program and the Cointelegraph Accelerator.\nMC² Finance differentiates itself from other platforms by focusing on risk-based returns and consistency rather than short-term profits. This is achieved through rigorous data analysis and expert validation. Expertise is verified through on-chain data showing past performance and social proof, such as performance on other protocols and verification by trusted third-party services.\nAs Richter explained: \u201cSocial is at the core of Web3 and is the future of trading. So what we offer is not only to follow our experts on a platform but also to connect with them outside, like in Telegram communities. You can ask about strategy details or potential risks. In addition, experts will be able to provide exclusive strategies to their followers through Social Tokens. They are linked to our token, have a one-click setup and are fully automated. Social Tokens will also come with unlimited liquidity thanks to our unique tokenomics. We are creating all this to foster a strong community and simplify trading.\u201d\n\u201cSocial media is run by influencers,\u201d Popoff said, continuing the social theme. \u201cSome are favored by the system more than others because they post more content, while others post less but focus on quality. We help find the real pros by providing on-chain and verifiable information about them. As for experts, you can create multiple strategies, each a little different from the other, to test the waters. And then share the most successful ones with your community. Soon you will even be able to share your results with an on-chain verifiable watermark. This will significantly increase trust compared to a simple, hard-to-verify screenshot.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s especially important because we have new generations like Gen Z. Half of them are already investing in crypto. And because they have grown up with the internet and love everything that is internet native, they want to understand where things come from,\" Richter added.\nMC² Finance is currently running a spot trading contest in partnership with Cointelegraph. Anyone is welcome to participate until March 6, 2024.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you trade with $10 or $100, because we measure success by the percentage return on your strategy,\u201d Popoff pointed out. \u201cThe only thing that is prohibited is adding money to your strategy otherwise you will be disqualified. For future competitions, we will be adding more DeFi primitives. Richter continued, \u201cWe want to expand to all primitives - liquidity provisioning, staking, lending, perpetuals - so you can make a true crypto-native strategy. After the token launch, we will also add securities, like stocks. Why not mix stocks, perpetuals and maybe even real estate in a single digital asset portfolio? We will also launch more trading contests and partner with more chains.\u201d\nRichter also stressed the importance of making multi-layered strategies for \u201cstacking\u201d DeFi protocols available to a wider audience to encourage further experimentation and unlock the full potential of DeFi.\nMC² Finance is currently deployed on Ethereum and BNB and is looking to expand to other chains. Richter outlined the unique structure of the platform: \u201cWe have three key components: social interaction, DeFi trading, and a reputation and analytics system. To ensure continuous improvement and community involvement, we have adopted a hybrid approach: initially, the source code of a component like reputation is available to our trusted partners. This allows us to test and improve quickly. Once optimal solutions are identified, they\u2019re implemented on-chain for decentralization and open-source access.\nSpeaking of institutional players, Richter emphasized the custody flexibility, as they can choose between MC² Finance\u2019s account abstraction wallet or their preferred custodian for asset custody. \u201cCustodians can subscribe to any strategy on our platform that meets the quality and risk criteria defined by you and your custodian. For example, we work with PWC. They have a lot of ESG data and ESG information on tokens. Their expert can create a strategy based only on ESG tokens and the PWC database. And if the strategy violates it, the user will automatically exit the strategy and keep the assets safe.\u201d\nFor now, MC² Finance\u2019s focus is on decentralized exchanges and fostering a decentralized network. But they are actively exploring future expansion. As Richter said: \u201cThe beauty of Web3 is that the token itself can be traded anywhere. So we can do the same with centralized exchanges later on.\u201c\nLearn more about MC² Finance\nDisclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Arianee co-founder and CEO Pierre-Nicolas Hurstel spoke to Cointelegraph about its reengineered infrastructure, allowing brands and developers to design highly customizable, cost-effective and performant digital passports and tokens linked to real-world products and assets.\n\u201cWe exclusively build on EVM [Ethereum Virtual Machine], catering to enterprise and scalable use cases. When striving to deliver a service that operates seamlessly, universally and with predictable costs, it remains hard and risky to build on L1 or even on Polygon mainnet,\u201d Hurstel explains.\nRelated: Polygon's new open-source L2 chain developer stack to support Ethereum ZK-powered layer 2s\nThe Arianee CEO said the company is focused on supporting brands engaged in scalable, high-performance and evolutive projects, which \u201cdemand an environment allowing precise control over efficiency in terms of both costs and energy consumption.\u201d\nArianee\u2019s native protocol token will be used for payments within the Polygon CDK application-specific chain (appchain), which is bridged to the Aria20 ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainnet. Launching the layer-2 appchain will allow brands to launch and manage their digital product passport and loyalty tokens.\nArianee is currently the infrastructure provider to more than 40 brands, including Breitling, Moncler, Yves Saint Laurent and Lacoste. Luxury watch brands like Breitling issue digital product passports on the protocol to give owners blockchain-based proof of ownership.\nArianee\u2019s infrastructure allows brands like Breitling to issue digital passports for watches to owners, who can manage their data and arrange services and products related to their assets. Source: Arianee\nThese digital passports are nonfungible tokens (NFTs) that provide customizable utility for their real-world counterparts. Owners own and control their data and can interact with manufacturers to organize and manage product repairs, warranties, insurance and other services.\nRelated: Blockchain to Revolutionize Luxury Watch Ownership\nPolygon\u2019s CDK is expected to deliver increased scalability and performance driven by ZK-proof technology. Brands using Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 token standard to issue NFTs and digital passports can also integrate existing infrastructure to Arianee\u2019s protocol using the Polygon CDK.\nAnother drawcard of the new layer-2 functionality is the provision of block space dedicated to individual applications on the protocol. This is touted to reduce the impact on user experience as a result of high network activity. Polygon\u2019s scaling infrastructure also reduces the operational costs of applications and services associated with gas fees and smart contract execution.\nPolygon released a new Type 1 prover in February, allowing ecosystem chains like optimistic rollups to unlock ZK-proofs\u2019 layer-2 functionality.

Chiliz introduced a new inflation-staking rewards mechanism for CHZ holders and the integration of the transaction fee protocol burning scheme EIP-1559.\nPSG gets first shot at token buy-back mechanism\nHelgosson told Cointelegraph that PSG will use its accrued revenue as a node validator to carry out PSG fan token buybacks from public marketplaces. The buybacks will be automated and executed by smart contracts through its validator and on decentralized exchanges on the Chiliz Chain.\nThe program aims to increase revenue from the club\u2019s validator through gas fees and supply inflation that are reinvested into PSG tokens. The club is interested in refreshing its token reserves to create a self-sustaining economy:\n\u201cWe\u2019re aiming to build a sustainable tokenomics model together where the club, because of our role as a node validator, can use the profits to buy back fan tokens and use them to reinvest back into the fan ecosystem.\u201d\nHelgosson says the move is expected to provide rewards, new utilities, functions, products and services that will benefit PSG tokenholders, sponsors and players.\nPSG and Chiliz are also planning a blockchain hackathon hosted at the club\u2019s iconic Parc des Princes stadium in the summer. The event aims to attract developers to build decentralized applications and products incorporating PSG tokens on the Chiliz Chain.\nAn alternative for sports organizations\nDreyfus tells Cointelegraph that PSG\u2019s move to become a validator could be a catalyst for other clubs to follow suit and better understand how the ecosystem\u2019s tokenomics work.\n\u201cAs for the drawcard, PSG is going to play an active role in the operations of the Chiliz ecosystem, meaning they will help build trust and attract more brands and developers, also by co-hosting hackathons with us at their stadium,\u201d Dreyfus explained.\nChiliz and Socios have been focused on building products and experiences for the broader sports industry. Dreyfus believes that its protocol needs stakeholders from the space to participate in its governance and ongoing operation.\nRelated: Sports Illustrated moves NFT ticketing platform to Avalanche\nThe Chiliz founder says his long-term goal is to have dozens to hundreds of validators comprised of sports organizations, fan-owned nodes and cryptocurrency firms.

On Jan. 8, the Ninjalerts team inscribed the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) emulator on Bitcoin. Apart from preserving games, the project was also an attempt to raise the technical bar for Bitcoin Ordinals projects.\nWeeks later, someone else took a crack at inscribing a video game on-chain using Ordinals. Following Ninjalerts, a pseudonymous developer called \u201cMini Doge\u201d inscribed the 1990s-style first-person shooter game Doom on the Dogecoin blockchain using the Ordinals protocol on Jan. 23. This allows users to play the free version of the classic game by accessing the Dogecoin network.\nOwens believes that the trend of inscribing games on-chain will persist. \u201cI think that's really cool, and I do think this trend will continue. People want to preserve cultural history, and games are a huge part of that.\u201d However, the executive urged community members not to break copyright laws. Owens said that they advocate for finding legal ways to preserve the games on-chain.\nRelated: Bitcoin Ordinals sales dipped 61% in January, halving sparks hope\nOwens also mentioned that as blockchain is permissionless, people can put whatever data they want on-chain. He suggested once it is on the blockchain it might be difficult for intellectual property holders to take down. \u201cThe interesting thing will be watching how the IP holders react. It is likely impossible to take this data down once it is uploaded onto the blockchain, especially on Bitcoin.\u201d\nCiting a study that found that nearly 90% of classic games released before 2010 are endangered, Owens highlighted the importance of preserving gaming history. The Ninjalerts CEO compared games to film and music and described them as an important part of culture that is worth preserving.\n\u201cIf we care about preserving history and culture, there is no better place to immortalize the data than on Bitcoin,\u201d Owens added.\nMagazine: Coinbase screws up, Florida bans CBDCs, and Ordinals face controversy: Hodler\u2019s Digest","article_summary":"Ninjalerts CEO Trevor Owens told Cointelegraph that there\u2019s no better place to immortalize data than on Bitcoin.","creation_date":"2024-02-22","associated_tags":["#Bitcoin","#Blockchain","#Games","#Gaming","#Bitcoin Ordinals"],"category":"INTERVIEW","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-nintendo-64-emulator","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Starknet\u2019s STRK token drops as Nethermind and airdrop hunters dump millions","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/starknet-gaming-committee-fund-nifty-news","name":"Jesse Coghlan"},"article_detailed_content":"The two-day-old token of Ethereum layer-2 network Starknet has more than halved in price as Ethereum infrastructure firm Nethermind and airdrop farmers dumped millions of dollars worth of the airdropped token.\nStarknet\u2019s (STRK) price has dropped nearly 60% and is trading under $1.90 from a Feb. 20 top of $4.41, when it was airdropped to some of the blockchain\u2019s users, according to CoinGecko data.\nSTRK hit as high as $7.70 on Binance following its listing on the exchange, but its price there has since dropped 75.4% to below $1.90.\nStarknet token has nearly halved in price from Feb. 20\u201322.

CurioInvest together with CurioDAO Association launched Curio Chain to democratize access to high-value investments and streamline the tokenization process.\nTraders have always coveted real-world assets like real estate, fine art and collectibles for their potential to yield returns in the investment world. However, their illiquid nature has traditionally limited liquidity, making it difficult for investors to quickly convert these assets into cash without significant loss of value.\nThe liquidity challenge, coupled with the fragmentation of markets \u2014 where each asset class operates within its own siloed ecosystem and regulatory framework \u2014 has further complicated cross-asset trading, increasing transaction costs and hindering seamless value transfer between different asset types.\nMoreover, the intricate regulatory landscape surrounding digital securities and tokenized assets and security concerns such as the risk of hacking and fraud present significant hurdles for those looking to innovate in the asset tokenization space.\nReal-world asset tokenization to solve traditional problems\nEnter RWA tokenization, an innovative concept that seeks to address the challenges of traditional asset markets head-on. By leveraging blockchain technology, RWA tokenization aims to enhance liquidity, bridge fragmented markets, navigate regulatory complexities and ensure robust security and trust in digital asset transactions.\nLaunched by CurioInvest together with CurioDAO Association, Curio Chain is an innovative RWA tokenization aggregator described as the \u201cDeFi Lego for RWAs.\u201d Designed to encapsulate various blockchain networks and decentralized applications (DApps) into a single product, Curio Chain offers a solution that efficiently integrates all necessary tools and services for users to tokenize RWAs.\nThe platform\u2019s primary objective is to facilitate the seamless conversion of tangible assets \u2014 from real estate and fine art to luxury goods \u2014 into digital tokens. By breaking down barriers to entry and enhancing liquidity in markets known for their illiquidity, Curio Chain aims to democratize access to these high-value investments, traditionally reserved for institutional investors.\nCurio Chain\u2019s aggregative approach streamlines the management of tokenized assets and reduces market fragmentation, making it easier for investors to access and invest in a diversified portfolio of real-world assets. The use of blockchain technology and smart contracts within Curio Chain ensures that the tokenization process is transparent, secure and compliant with relevant regulatory standards.\nGiving investors a voice with DAO governance\nStructured as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called CurioDAO, the platform allows stakeholders to vote on important platform decisions, including upgrades and the direction of the ecosystem.\nThe Curio Chain utilizes the Curio Governance Token (CGT) as the CurioDAO ecosystem\u2019s native coin. CGT plays a crucial role in the platform\u2019s governance, acting as the voting medium for stakeholders to influence platform decisions.\nDesigned with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, Curio Chain allows users to seamlessly transition from the Ethereum ecosystem to Polkadot, ensuring easy integration. Curio Chain will progressively implement EVM compatibility across all DApps on the platform.\nHow automated market makers assist RWA investments\nThe Curio ecosystem also includes CapitalDex.exchange, a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) pivotal for enabling market creation for RWA tokens. The platform\u2019s integration of cross-chain functionality enables effortless trading across diverse blockchain networks.\nCapitalDex.exchange champions enhanced security, transparency and autonomy in asset exchange by allowing users to engage in peer-to-peer swaps without intermediaries. The platform plans to integrate with the Albus protocol to enhance accountability with comprehensive accounting documentation and establish permissioned ecosystems where only whitelisted participants can access liquidity pools.\nCurioInvest creates investment opportunities for a variety of assets. Source: CurioInvest \nCurioInvest enables users to invest in various assets, from luxury cars, wines and rare collectibles to commodities such as minerals through its native DIA token. \nFernando Verboonen, CEO of CurioInvest, believes that democratizing access to emerging open markets enables widespread participation, promoting enhanced financial inclusivity and empowerment, adding:\n\u201cWe envision a future where the tokenization of financial assets revolutionizes the traditional investment landscape, unlocking capital from real assets and paving the way for a more inclusive capitalism.\u201d\nVladimir Kislinkii, chief technology officer of CurioInvest, added: \n\u201cCurio Chain stands out as an excellent tool, offering the capability to tokenize a wide array of assets across multiple chains, positioning us at the forefront of the revolutionary financial landscape.

They\u2019re also more used to trading on exchanges than some European investors that are still stuck in mutual funds that their bank or fund manager once advised,\u201d Rozemuller said.\nThe VanEck Europe CEO highlights key differences in attitude toward the cryptocurrency sector on either side of the Atlantic Ocean. Europe\u2019s crypto-curious investors typically include retail users, smaller independent wealth managers and family offices:\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly retail because a lot of the larger financial institutions are still reluctant to use any crypto-related products in their standard portfolios.\u201d\nRozemuller adds that although Europe has a number of exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that are appropriately licensed, local regulators have \u201cexplicitly\u201d mentioned that they\u2019re not in favor of crypto-related investments.\nWhy Europe doesn\u2019t have spot Bitcoin ETFs\nThe fanfare around the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has spilled over to markets outside of the U.S., although European regulatory frameworks do not allow for investment products solely based on a single underlying asset.\nRozemuller explains that Europe\u2019s Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) regulation is the reason for this.\n\u201cUnder UCITS, in particular, it\u2019s not possible to get an ETF with one single exposure beneath it. There are a couple of rules when it comes to diversification within the framework,\u201d Rozemuller said.\nThe VanEck Europe CEO says that the reality of a Bitcoin ETF is not possible from this perspective, adding that an underlying asset needs to have an International Securities Identification Number to also be eligible as an ETF.\nRelated: Crypto exchange-traded products hit bull run levels with $67B AUM\nVanEck Europe\u2019s efforts to launch investment products with direct exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies required an innovative approach. This includes a range of exchange-traded products (ETPs), which ensures customers are served by a liquidity provider independent of the issuer in an open market.\n\u201cThat is good because it ensures there is transparent price discovery so you don\u2019t have issues like the Grayscale products in the U.S. where there can be a huge premium or discount,\u201d Rozemuller explains.\nA range of investment products, including exchange-traded commodities and ETNs, allow for different offerings. ETN structures, according to Rozemuller, allow firms like VanEck to fit assets like Bitcoin into the product.\n\u201cFrom a practical perspective, there is no significant difference because the ETN is traded like an ETF in a very similar way. We do not use futures contracts, there\u2019s just spot Bitcoin in the product. But an ETN, from a legal perspective, is a debt instrument,\u201d Rozemuller said.\nVanEck Europe\u2019s Bitcoin ETN most closely resembles spot Bitcoin ETF offerings in the United States. The product offers exposure to BTC, which is held in cold storage by Bank Frick in Liechtenstein. The company has since launched Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and Tron ETN\u2019s, which are similarly structured.\nExposure to crypto companies\nAside from its crypto-based ETNs, VanEck\u2019s Crypto and Blockchain Innovators UCITS ETF (DAPP) aims to offer investors diversified exposure to a handful of listed cryptocurrency exchanges, miners and infrastructure companies in the wider blockchain space.\nVanEck product manager and blockchain white paper author Alessandro Rollo unpacked details of the fund in conversation with Cointelegraph. The DAPP ETF has a significant weight toward Bitcoin miners, with around 50% of the fund\u2019s net assets comprised of shares in firms including Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital and Argo Blockchain. Rollo adds:\n\u201cWe also have crypto exchanges, notably Coinbase, and companies like MicroStrategy who simply have decided to hold large quantities of Bitcoin on their balance sheet.\u201d\nVanEck\u2019s DAPP ETF top 10 holdings include shares in major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and mining firms, including Marathon Digital. Source: VanEck\nRollo adds that the ETF tracks an underlying index managed by Market Vector, which is rebalanced quarterly, allowing VanEck to explore new opportunities that might arise.\nFor crypto company equities to be included in the DAPP ETF, they must derive at least 50% of revenues from digital assets or related activities. Or, like MicroStrategy, they need to hold at least 50% of their assets in the form of cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet.\nGetting boomers into Bitcoin\nCointelegraph also questioned the need and demand for a cryptocurrency ETP or ETF product when the average retail investor is able to trade or hold a large variety of tokens offered by exchanges and trading platforms.\nRozemuller explained that his own apprehension toward self-custody, particularly when it involves significant exposure to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, is a sentiment shared by fellow \u201cboomers\u201d and older-generation investors.\nRelated: Big banks are nudging the SEC for a slice of sweet Bitcoin ETF action\n\u201cThere were probably more investors like me that did see some potential but were not comfortable enough with buying it through a crypto exchange and having to self-custody with all those stories of exchanges being hacked or people losing their hard drives,\u201d Rozemuller said.\nA range of products offered by investment firms offering exposure to cryptocurrencies at arm\u2019s length presents a middle ground of sorts. Safekeeping is managed by services with experience and reputable track records, and the product itself is typically available through a conventional investment account.\nMagazine: \u2018Crypto is inevitable\u2019 so we went \u2018all in\u2019: Meet Vance Spencer, permabull\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to our Crypto Biz newsletter\nA weekly pulse of the business behind blockchain and crypto.

When selling to dealers, collectors could receive lower offers as dealers need to profit when reselling the items. Taking the auction route could raise better prices but also takes a lot of preparation and requires the payment of third-party fees.\nLuxury items used as collateral for blockchain-based loans in Altr. Source: Altr\nThe executive believes that blockchain can play a role in solving these hassles for collectors. According to Rovelli, collectors can digitize their collectibles, create a digital certificate of ownership within the blockchain and use the digitized assets as collateral to obtain loans on-chain quickly. Rovelli explained:\n\u201cThe blockchain gives the opportunity to access on-chain liquidity that has never played a role in the traditional market of collectibles. By bringing this world on-chain, crypto holders, crypto funds and VCs [venture capitalists] can be exposed to the luxury collectibles space.\u201d\nThe tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) has been a growing topic of discussion in the crypto space. When asked about the importance of tokenization, Rovelli shared that it gives an \u201cextra layer of transparency in a sector where transparency was never the strength.\u201d\nRelated: Whisky distributor uses NFTs and AI to sell 50-year-old collection\nHe added that this allows users to bring assets on-chain after they have been certified, valued and stored. This allows enhanced security and almost instant liquidity as users could use the digital tokens representing the assets as collateral for blockchain-based loans. Rovelli believes that this approach unlocks the economic value of luxury items and represents a shift in leveraging luxury assets in the digital age.\nRovelli also argued that Web3, which focuses on transparency and security, aligns well with the needs of the luxury industry. This is because Web3 offers ways to \u201cconfirm the genuineness of high-end products\u201d and track their history. A Web3-based system could make it \u201calmost impossible\u201d to fake luxury goods, according to Rovelli.\nMagazine: This is your brain on crypto: Substance abuse grows among crypto traders","article_summary":"Altr adviser Davide Rovelli believes that asset tokenization could give an extra layer of security to a sector where \u201ctransparency was never the strength.\u201d","creation_date":"2024-02-20","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Business","#Lending","#Tokens","#Liquidity","#Polygon"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-lending-platform-luxury-collectibles","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Hong Kong exchange licensing clarity attracts traditional brokerages","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/israel-announces-plans-interest-bearing-shekel-cbdc","name":"Zhiyuan Sun"},"article_detailed_content":"Less than a year after Hong Kong regulators approved crypto exchanges, traditional financial institutions and brokerages alike have been keen to obtain their digital asset licenses for trading.\nIn January, Chinese stock brokerage Tiger Brokers upgraded its Type 1 Hong Kong Securities & Futures Commission (SFC) to include crypto trading for professional investors and financial institutions based in Hong Kong. In an interview with Cointelegraph, John Fei Zeng, chief financial officer and director of Tiger Brokers, explained that the firm currently has 865,500 funded accounts with a combined $18.9 billion in managed assets.\n\"Currently, Tiger Brokers (HK) has uplifted its license to trade virtual assets for professional investor clients through a SFC-licensed virtual assets platform and will accept retail clients after SFC's approval,\" said Feng. \"Residents of Hong Kong will be able to trade virtual assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside stocks, options, futures, funds, and ETFs [Through Tiger Trade].\"\nThe firm is currently evaluating additional digital assets, such as altcoins, for listing subject to regulatory approval alongside an international expansion strategy in licensed markets such as Australia, the U.S., Singapore, Hong Kong, the U.K., and New Zealand. Feng stated:\n\"Other than stocks and options, crypto is becoming an important asset class. It's hence a natural extension of business as a broker-dealer to add a new asset class, and the underlying Web3 technology is also integrated with Tiger's fintech background.\"\nSimilarly, last November, Hong Kong brokerage Victory Securities obtained a license from the SFC to offer crypto trading services for retail investors. \"According to the company\u2019s data, the amount of virtual asset transactions and the number of new customers in the third quarter of this year more than doubled compared with the previous quarter,\" the company said. \"In order to encourage new customers to choose compliant and safe virtual asset trading services, we will launch a number of trading discounts [in the future].\"\nLikewise, licensed Hong Kong crypto exchange OSL partnered with Interactive Brokers on Nov. 28, 2023, for the latter to open Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) trading to retail investors through its platform. On Feb. 1, Cointelegraph reported that crypto exchange Bybit had submitted a retail trading license application in Hong Kong. Currently, Web3 firms may need to chime in as much as $25 million to invest in corporate infrastructure and compliance required for license approval. \nRelated: HashKey Exchange to onboard market makers to boost liquidity\nExplore more articles like this\nSubscribe to the Cointelegraph Research Newsletter\nSelect the Cointelegraph newsletters to which you would like to subscribe to receive the latest news and analysis directly from our team.

The exchange has since settled with the DOJ for $4.3 billion, while the SEC lawsuit is ongoing. \nExchange tokens, issued by centralized entities themselves, allow users to gain trading benefits on exchanges. They can also be used to pay for gas fees and engage in decentralized finance on blockchains created by centralized exchanges. Some exchange tokens also allow users to participate in the platform's governance activities.\nMeanwhile, OKX exchange's native token OKB has seen a gain of 132% from its FTX lows, with a total gain of 3,227% since its inception in May 2019. On January 25, the OKB token witnessed a massive flash crash, wiping out nearly $6.5 billion in a matter of minutes before fully recovering and reaching new all-time highs. A brief market sell-off that day had caused multiple leveraged liquidations in pledged lending, margin trading, and cross-currency transactions within the OKX platform, causing the flash crash. The exchange has since compensated affected users via an airdrop. \nLikewise, Bitget exchange's BGB token has rallied to all-time highs of $1.03, with a yearly gain of 159%. Last September, the exchange pledged a $100 million fund, dubbed \"EmpowerX,\" dedicated to blockchain, AI, and Web3 projects. Gracy Chen, managing director of Bitget, said at the time that the company expects more investments, mergers, and acquisitions in the coming months as the centralized exchange landscape evolves with changes in regulations. \nUnsurprisingly, FTX's FTT token has lost over 90% of its value compared to its pre-bankruptcy highs. Although the exchange expects to fully repay customers, excluding bankruptcy fees, the exchange itself will not restart.\n\u201cNo investor is ready to commit the needed capital to a restart of the offshore exchange, nor has a buyer emerged for that exchange as a going concern,\" said bankruptcy lawyer Andy Dietderich. \u201cThe costs and risks of creating a viable exchange from what Mr. Bankman-Fried left in the dumpster were simply too high.\u201d\nRelated: Hong Kong crypto stocks surge, OKX to invest in L1s: Asia Express","article_summary":"Centralized exchanges have largely shrugged off the contagion caused by FTX's bankruptcy in November 2022.","creation_date":"2024-02-19","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Cryptocurrencies","#Business","#Cryptocurrency Exchange","#Binance","#FTX Token","#OKX","#FTX"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/trust-crypto-exchange-tokens-recovers-ftx-lows","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Events get NFT tickets: Belong joins Cointelegraph Accelerator","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/redefining-digital-identity-metropolis-joins-cointelegraph-accelerator","name":"Cointelegraph Accelerator"},"article_detailed_content":"The event industry, vital for fostering connections, culture and education, faces ongoing challenges that impact its efficacy and reputation. Issues like ticket fraud remain to be solved while ticket-related scams double in 2023.\nAnother pressing challenge is the struggle to cultivate meaningful engagement with attendees. In an era where digital interaction and content consumption habits are rapidly surpassing traditional alternatives, many events fail to capture and sustain the attention of their audiences. This engagement deficit is particularly evident in the difficulty of creating compelling pre-event anticipation, maintaining live interaction and extending the conversation post-event.\nDigital consumption is expected to nearly double traditional consumption by 2025.

This step involves the introduction of Verkle trees, which will optimize data storage and node size. Buterin outlined the technical details of Verkle trees in its Ethereum Improvement Proposal documentation published in 2022.\nVerkle trees serve a similar function to Merkle trees, which total all transactions in a block and produce proof of the entire set of data for a user looking to verify its authenticity:\n\u201cThe key property that Verkle Trees provide, however, is that they are much more efficient in proof size.\u201d\nVerkle trees use similar tree-like structures to Merkle trees, but a key differentiator is that nodes use a particular type of hash called a vector commitment that is passed to sub-nodes. Vector commitments will provide meaningful, long-term benefits to the Ethereum network.\nThe main benefit of Verkle trees is to help Ethereum achieve statelessness, which would be the eventuality that sees nodes verifying blocks no longer needing to store the state of Ethereum.\nVerkle trees allow for smaller proof sizes, which can be contained within each block of the Ethereum blockchain. The result allows nodes to verify any block using the data contained in the block itself.\nA range of new types of functionality will result from the implementation of Verkle trees, including lower hardware requirements to run Ethereum nodes which is expected to improve decentralization of the network. New nodes can also join the network almost instantaneously, with the ability to quickly sync with the network.\nThe development of Verkle trees is ongoing, and implementation of the Ethereum protocol will require a number of changes. This includes a new data structure to save the network\u2019s state, a new gas accounting model, a strategy to migrate Ethereum\u2019s state from Merkle to Verkle trees, new cryptography primitives and new fields at the block level. \nMagazine: Ethereum restaking: Blockchain innovation or dangerous house of cards?","article_summary":"Verkle trees form part of Ethereum\u2019s post-Merge roadmap, promising smaller proof sizes and lower hardware requirements for nodes.","creation_date":"2024-02-19","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Ethereum","#Vitalik Buterin","#Nodes","#Validator","#Staking"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/verkle-trees-superior-ethereum-solo-staking-vitalik-buterin","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Virginia proposes $39K yearly fund for crypto and AI commissions","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-earmarks-1-25-b-ai-growth","name":"Arijit Sarkar"},"article_detailed_content":"A Virginia senate committee has recommended a yearly combined fund allocation of $39,240 for two newly formed commissions on artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency.\nA Feb. 18 proposal from the Subcommittee on General Government of the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee allocated over $23.6 million for various legislative departments.

As a result, the bill incentivizes the use of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions via tax benefits.\nMagazine: \u2018Crypto is inevitable\u2019 so we went \u2018all in\u2019: Meet Vance Spencer, permabull","article_summary":"The proposal allocates a yearly general fund of $22,048 and $17,192, respectively, to the two newly formed commissions on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency in the state of Virginia.","creation_date":"2024-02-19","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Government","#Funding","#Legislation","#US Government","#United States","#AI","#Virginia"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/virginia-fund-cryptocurrency-ai-commission","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"Vitalik Buterin says AI could help solve Ethereum\u2019s \u2018biggest technical risk\u2019","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-surges-crypto-etfs-notch-record-weekly-inflows","name":"Tom Mitchelhill"},"article_detailed_content":"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin says artificial intelligence (AI) could be crucial to solving one of Ethereum\u2019s \u201cbiggest technical\u201d risks: bugs buried deep within its code. \nIn a Feb. 18 post on X, Buterin shared his excitement for AI-powered auditing to identify and fix buggy code in the Ethereum network, describing it as the \u201cbiggest technical risk\u201d to the network.\nOne application of AI that I am excited about is AI-assisted formal verification of code and bug finding.\n\nRight now ethereum's biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing.\n\u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 19, 2024\nButerin\u2019s comments come as Ethereum closes in on implementing its long-awaited Dencun upgrade, which is currently slated for launch on March 13. Dencun was implemented on the Goerli testnet on Jan. 17, but a bug in Prsym prevented the network from finalizing on the testnet for four hours. Upgrades to the Ethereum network are crucial to the long-term roadmap of the blockchain.\nHowever, not everyone agrees that AI is a reliable tool to detect bugs in Ethereum-based code.\nIn July 2023, OpenZeppelin conducted a series of experiments that utilized OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 to identify security issues in Solidity smart contracts \u2014 the native language of Ethereum code.\nDuring these experiments, GPT-4 successfully identified vulnerabilities in 20 out of 28 challenges.\nChatGPT analyzes a smart contract. Source: OpenZeppelin\nWhen GPT-4 failed to identify flaws, it could often be prompted to correct its mistakes quickly. However, at other times, OpenZeppelin found that the AI had actually invented a vulnerability that had never existed in the first place.\nSimilarly, Kang Li, the chief security officer at CertiK, told Cointelegraph that using AI-powered tools \u2014 such as ChatGPT \u2014 in coding often creates more security issues than it solves.\nOverall, Li recommends that AI assistants should be used only as assistants to experienced coders, as they can be helpful in quickly explaining to developers what a line of code means.\n\u201cI think ChatGPT is a great helpful tool for people doing code analysis and reverse engineering. It\u2019s definitely a good assistant, and it\u2019ll improve our efficiency tremendously.\u201d\nRelated: Making Vitalik Buterin\u2019s cypherpunk dream for Ethereum a reality\nWhile Buterin is largely optimistic about the future of AI, he has previously warned developers to exercise caution when implementing AI with blockchain technology, particularly when deploying it alongside \u201chigh-risk\u201d applications, such as oracles.\n\u201cIt is important to be careful: if someone builds e.g. a prediction market or a stablecoin that uses an AI oracle, and it turns out that the oracle is attackable, that\u2019s a huge amount of money that could disappear in an instant.\u201d\nMagazine: \u2018Crypto is inevitable\u2019 so we went \u2018all in\u2019 \u2014 Meet Vance Spencer, permabull","article_summary":"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shared his enthusiasm for AI in helping to identify potential flaws in Ethereum\u2019s codebase.","creation_date":"2024-02-19","associated_tags":["#Blockchain","#Smart Contracts","#Ethereum","#Vitalik Buterin","#Coding"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-technical-risk-bug-code-ai-auditing-smart-contract-vitalik-buterin","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"},{"article_title":"FixedFloat confirms $26M exploit in Bitcoin, Ether","article_type":"Article","author":{"last_post":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-dao-removes-proposal-fund-tornado-cash-devs","name":"Ana Paula Pereira"},"article_detailed_content":"Decentralized crypto exchange FixedFloat has been exploited for at least $26 million worth of Bitcoin and Ether, according to on-chain data. \nThe exchange team confirmed the attack a few hours after it was first reported on X (formerly Twitter).

Supported by Coinbase Ventures, Jump Trading and ParaFi Capital, the company acquired a valuation of $2.5 billion.\nThe increased interest in crypto from financial institutions can be attributed to the launch of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States in January, according to PitchBook\u2019s report.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, crypto firms secured $2.6 billion in 353 investment rounds, according to PitchBook\u2019s Q1 Crypto Report. The report showed an 11% decline in deal value from the previous quarter and a 12.2% decrease in total deals. Furthermore, the quarter marked the lowest capital investment in the space since 2020.\nRelated: GoFundMe shuts down Tornado Cash legal defense crowdfunding\nThe crypto industry faced challenges in 2022, with market difficulties reflected in reduced venture capital funding for blockchain and crypto sectors. Following the peak at $11 billion and 692 deals in the initial four months of 2022, VC investment steadily declined in subsequent quarters.\nVarious factors led to decreased crypto and blockchain-related VC funding in 2022, including the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, resulting in the bankruptcy of cryptocurrency lending firms Three Arrows Capital and Celsius.\nThe FTX collapse in November 2022 intensified market volatility, and broader global economic factors, such as increased interest rates and inflation, also contributed to the decline in venture capital investments.\nIn 2023, the crypto industry saw a turnaround, with stories of adoption worldwide and major TradFi institutions like BlackRock entering the crypto space.\nMagazine: OKX token\u2019s $6.5B flash crash, crypto exec \u2018Mr Bang\u2019 on the run: Asia Express","article_summary":"The growing interest of financial institutions in crypto is attributed to the launch of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, according to a report from PitchBook.","creation_date":"2024-02-18","associated_tags":["#Bitcoin","#Blockchain","#Cryptocurrencies","#Investments","#Cryptocurrency Exchange"],"category":"NEWS","article_link":"https://cointelegraph.com/news/vc-blockchain-and-crypto-funding-rises-in-q4-2023-report","website_source":"Coin Telegraph"}]
