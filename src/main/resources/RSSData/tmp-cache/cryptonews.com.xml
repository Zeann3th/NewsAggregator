<p><i><span>Sunday, March 24th, 2024</span></i><span> –  Solana meme coin $PUNDU has closed out its presale with a whopping $37 million raise, but Dogecoin20 is still open, and contributors are pushing its presale towards a $10 million hard cap sellout.</span></p>
<p><span>At the time of writing </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20"><span>Dogecoin20</span></a><span> ($DOGE20) – an upgraded better version of Dogecoin – has amassed more than $7.6 million from investors in barely a week as meme coin fever continues. </span></p>
<p><span>Luckily for those arriving late at the party or may have missed $PUNDU, the creators of $DOGE20 have extended the presale. </span></p>
<p><span>Nevertheless, given the hype and FOMO developing around the token, the initial coin offering is highly likely to sell out early this week given its past fundraising performance, so buyers need to move fast.</span></p>
<p><span>Dogecoin20 is bringing $DOGE to the Ethereum blockchain and dispensing with the inflationary supply that could hold it back in the future and the computationally expensive mining system the coin still uses. </span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>Ethereum is still the No.1 blockchain for decentralized applications and its recent Dencun software revamp has been a roaring success that is already reducing the transaction fees from Layer 2s like Polygon and Optimism. </span></p>
<p><span>All of this makes Dogecoin20 token even more attractive because it is built on a future-proof architecture that is constantly improving.</span></p>
<h2><span>Dogecoin price is up 7% today as its march higher continues… and Dogecoin20 is coming up fast in its slipstream</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Meanwhile, the world’s best-known and most valuable meme coin, Dogecoin, sees its price maintain an upward trajectory despite consolidation in the crowded bitcoin trade.</span></p>
<p><span>$DOGE is 7% higher at the beginning of the European session on Sunday, priced at $0.1733.</span></p>
<p><span>Dogecoin20 is currently $0.000208 priced at $0.000164 in what is now the 14th stage of the presale price ladder. Such has been the demand for the </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20"><span>$DOGE20</span></a><span> token that the presale has been extended, with the hard cap target moved out to $10 million so that the voracious appetite of legions of buyers can be satisfied.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>&mdash; Dogecoin20 (@DOGE_COIN20) <a href="https://twitter.com/DOGE_COIN20/status/1771582749129797818?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>But with the Dogecoin20 presale run rate regularly exceeding more than half a million dollars per day, prospective contributors will need to move in a spritely fashion to secure the lowest available prices. </span></p>
<p><span>Stage 14 ends either in two days or when the target of $8,183,163 is reached, whichever comes first. The previous hard cap total was </span><span>$6,315,663</span><span> but has now been updated to $10,068,663. </span></p>
<h2><span>On-chain staking passive income means Dogecoin20 is better than Dogecoin  </span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>You get more woof with </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20"><span>$DOGE20</span></a><span> – it has the foundation to build a meme coin like nothing that has come before in the Shiba Inu-inspired token world, thanks to its built-in on-chain staking feature.</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike Dogecoin, this upgraded version deploys Ethereum smart contracts to underpin the mechanics of what is a passive income vehicle, where stakers of $DOGE20 are rewarded with an income stream denominated in $DOGE20. </span></p>
<p><span>You can start staking as soon as you buy in the presale. Estimated rewards are currently 132$ per annum and more than 21 billion $DOGE20 tokens have been staked.</span></p>

<h2><span>$DOGE20 fixes the $DOGE inflation problem and is attracting big Chinese money</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Another aspect to the improvements that Dogecoin20 is bringing is the problem of the infinite supply of Dogecoin. $DOGE20 fixes this emissions problem by introducing a fixed supply of 140,000,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span>Much of the new money flowing into crypto is coming from China and </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20"><span>Dogecoin20</span></a><span> with its ‘best Doge upgrade’ appeal is attracting substantial funding from that quarter, along with Pundu and another coin called $PUMP. </span></p>
<p><span>In what could be among the biggest presales ever, $PUMP, which is a BNB Smart Chain coin with a massive Chinese following, has raised $280 million.  </span></p>
<p><span>Whichever chain meme coins are launching on, then, there is a more than ample supply of willing buyers from China and elsewhere – providing a coin can demonstrate it has the potential to hit the mark in the virality stakes, as Dogecoin20 does.</span></p>
<h2><span>Top finance news sites and YouTube crypto are excited about $DOGE20</span></h2>

<p><span>Elsewhere, Youtuber Matthew Perry has been letting his 217k subscribers know all about Dogecoin20, going as far as to say it is better than $DOGE. </span></p>
<p><span>Without a doubt, Dogecoin is still the king of the meme coins and the one to watch. It is this brand power that makes Dogecoin20’s focus on bettering ‘the Doge’ such an investible opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span>Those who snapped up Dogecoin at its all-time low in May 2015 and held it until today are sitting on gains of 202,045%, according to Coinmarketcap data. With that sort of ROI on the table in the meme coins sector, the sky’s the limit for Dogecoin20. The $DOGE20 price could 100x at launch. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20"><span>$DOGE20</span></a><span> can be bought with ETH, USDT, BNB or with fiat using a card.

<p>This substantial figure not only surpassed initial expectations but also underscored the crypto community&#8217;s growing appetite for such speculative investments.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The presale drew an extensive commitment from BNB Chain&#8217;s prominent cryptocurrency holders, amassing 363,000 BNB, 9 million CAKE, 24 million BAKE, 1.5 trillion 1CAT, and 73 trillion IQ50, reflecting a blend of confidence and speculative interest in PUMP&#8217;s potential market impact.</p>
<h2><strong>PUMP&#8217;s Intriguing Appeal in the Crypto Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Defined by BakerySwap as a meme coin devoid of utility, PUMP embodies the quintessential crypto dream: significant asset appreciation.</p>
<p>Despite its speculative nature and lack of a development team, PUMP&#8217;s launch parallels the early days of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, which evolved from a joke to a major cryptocurrency with a $21.3 billion market cap.</p>
<p>This trajectory underscores the speculative and community-driven aspects that often fuel meme coins&#8217; popularity and success.</p>
<h2><strong>Speculative Surge or Ephemeral Hype? The PUMP Dilemma</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
As PUMP navigates the volatile crypto market, its future hinges on the community&#8217;s sentiment and speculative investment trends.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bakery_swap/status/1771122074976923753">BakerySwap&#8217;s recent tweets</a> confirm the completion of the PUMP presale and the upcoming start of trading, sparking widespread anticipation for its market performance.</p>
<p>The significant presale participation and the sheer volume of committed assets indicate a potent mix of confidence and speculative interest in PUMP&#8217;s journey on the BNB Chain.</p>

<p>PUMP&#8217;s emergence as a Chinese Meme Coin and its record-setting presale reflect the crypto market&#8217;s continued fascination with high-risk, high-reward digital assets. Whether PUMP will ascend to viral fame or fade into obscurity remains to be seen.</p>
<h2>Embracing the Future: Dogecoin20 Unleashed</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Emin Gün Sirer, the co-founder of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/avax-avalanche/">Avalanche</a> blockchain, has sounded the alarm on deceptive trends infiltrating certain layer-2 (L2) solutions, posing risks to investors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1771658050228617428?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">recent post on X</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Sirer expressed concerns about these &#8220;trash&#8221; projects while educating users about their common characteristics and red flags.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sirer believes that the rise of substandard L2 projects represents the next significant hazard in the crypto ecosystem, following the infamous crypto exchange heist orchestrated by former FTX founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Trash&#8221; L2 Projects Flood the Market</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">The renowned crypto figure argues that the launch procedures for L2 solutions are relatively lax, allowing bad actors to create projects with little to no value.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To safeguard investor security, Sirer outlined several warning signs associated with these risky L2 solutions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firstly, he noted a discrepancy between the project&#8217;s narrative and its underlying technology, indicating a misalignment between marketing claims and technical implementation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For instance, projects with centralized sequencers and no fraud-proof mechanisms contradict the core principles of decentralization and security in the cryptocurrency realm.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sirer also highlighted L2 solutions that conduct token sales primarily for fundraising purposes, rather than having a specific, practical use on the network. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Such projects raise suspicions of dubious investments. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Moreover, Sirer cautioned against L2 projects in which founders sell their personal native tokens before the project&#8217;s launch, considering it a significant red flag.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey y&#39;all,</p>
<p>We all ignored the huge red flags associated with SBF because &quot;he looked smart&quot; and &quot;he made a lot of money.&quot; Then it turned out that he was dumb as rocks, was a sociopath, and was just stealing our money.</p>
<p>The next cycle is going to be even more noisy, with even…</p>
<p>&mdash; Emin Gün Sirer<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f53a.png" alt="🔺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@el33th4xor) <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1771658050228617428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Issue of Low-Float Tokens within L2s</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another concern raised by Sirer is the prevalence of low-float tokens within projects, which can artificially inflate token values through manipulative tactics, similar to those employed by SBF. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lastly, Sirer advised investors to pay attention to the moral conduct and habits of project founders, as any signs of personal misconduct should be considered during the evaluation process.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to the mentioned red flags, Sirer proposed a simple test to help investors navigate the vast number of L2 projects being launched daily and identify authentic and profitable ventures. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He suggested identifying the main issues, or &#8220;blockers,&#8221; in the crypto space at any given time. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For example, scalability and performance were significant concerns until solutions emerged from blockchains like Avalanche and Solana.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sirer believes that supporting multiple use cases on the same platform and integrating with traditional finance (TradFi) are currently critical challenges facing the crypto ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before investing in an L2 solution, Sirer advises users to assess whether the project genuinely addresses these challenges.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem has experienced substantial expansion over the past year and a half, with a total value locked (TVL) surpassing $27 billion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In October 2023, transaction activity on Layer 2 networks exceeded that of the Ethereum mainnet, with these networks now routinely processing five times as many transactions, according to L2beat.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As reported, Ethereum-based layer 2 network Arbitrum now </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrum-dominates-with-nearly-50-of-ethereum-layer-2-total-value-locked.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has a market share of 49.17%</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> among layer 2 networks, far surpassing number two on the list, Optimism Mainnet, with its 28.85% market share.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The network has also seen a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/arbitrums-total-value-locked-surges-past-2-5-billion-as-token-nears-2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">consistent increase in its TVL</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> at least since October last year, rising about 50% from $1.66 billion in October to the current value of $2.51 billion, data from DeFi tracking site DefiLlama showed.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has criticized crypto industry participants for avoiding registration requirements with the regulator.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> In his closing remarks during a </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-columbia-law-school-032224" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">speech at Columbia Law School</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Gensler emphasized the importance of mandatory disclosure for market participants, referring to Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis&#8217; statement that &#8220;Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gensler expressed concern over certain participants in the crypto securities markets seeking to evade registration requirements, which results in a lack of mandatory disclosure. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He highlighted the need for transparency in the crypto markets, suggesting that some disinfectant measures could benefit the industry. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gary Gensler Wages War Against Crypto Companies</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the past year, the SEC has filed numerous lawsuits against crypto firms, with SEC Chair Gary Gensler consistently asserting that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For one, the agency initiated a civil case </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-and-cftcs-lawsuits-against-sam-bankman-fried-put-on-hold-by-us-judge-heres-why.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">against Sam Bankman-Fried</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, co-founder of FTX. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to the case against Bankman-Fried, the SEC filed lawsuits against other major crypto players, including </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-sues-binance-cz-over-blantant-disregard-of-its-rules.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Binance, its CEO Changpeng Zhao</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-exchange-coinbase-sues-sec-demands-court-compel-response-rulemaking-petition-heres-latest.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coinbase</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Many industry players and advocacy groups have called on the SEC to establish clear regulatory guidelines to foster innovation within the United States.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC has reportedly issued subpoenas as part of its campaign to potentially </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-reportedly-probing-key-crypto-companies-in-push-to-make-eth-a-security-fortune.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">classify Ethereum (ETH) as a security</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> under its regulatory purview. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“[T]here still are those who would like to whittle away at the SEC’s disclosure regime,” said the SEC chair. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“There are participants in crypto securities markets that seek to avoid these registration requirements. No registration means no mandatory disclosure. Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In recent years, the SEC has made progress in approving crypto-related exchange-traded products for U.S. exchanges, including investment vehicles tied to ETH and Bitcoin futures, along with the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SEC Postpones Decision on Futures ETH ETF</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a separate development, the SEC has once again extended the deadline to decide on the approval of Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum Futures Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2024/34-99842.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced that the previous deadline</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> of March 31 will be postponed to May 30. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The ETF proposed by digital asset management firm Grayscale aims to invest in Ethereum futures contracts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC&#8217;s decision to extend the deadline follows its earlier postponement in December 2023, during which it sought additional public input on whether the ETF should be listed. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Grayscale had proposed listing and trading shares of its Ethereum Futures Trust ETF under the New York Stock Exchange Arca Rule 8.200-E in September 2023. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that Grayscale might be using its futures ETF application as a strategic move to influence the SEC&#8217;s decision on approving its spot Ether ETF. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If the SEC were to approve Grayscale&#8217;s futures ETF, it could strengthen Grayscale&#8217;s argument for the approval of its spot Ether ETF application.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, the SEC has also delayed its decision on whether to approve Grayscale&#8217;s spot Ether ETF, opening the application to public comments on January 25. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Executives at Anthropic have cited these concerns as the reason for ruling out Saudi Arabian involvement, as </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/22/anthropic-lining-up-a-new-slate-of-investors-ruled-out-saudi-arabia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported by CNBC</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bankman-Fried, acquired the stake three years ago for $500 million. Thanks to the recent surge of interest in AI technologies, the value of the 8% stake has now exceeded $1 billion.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sources reveal that the class B shares, which do not grant voting rights, are being sold based on Anthropic&#8217;s most recent valuation of $18.4 billion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In recent years, Anthropic has raised approximately $7 billion from tech giants such as Amazon, Alphabet, and Salesforce. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company&#8217;s advanced language model directly competes with OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While founders Dario and Daniela Amodei retain the right to challenge potential investors, they are currently not involved in the fundraising process or discussions regarding FTX&#8217;s stake. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Amodei siblings were introduced to Bankman-Fried through the concept of &#8220;effective altruism,&#8221; which involves maximizing wealth for charitable causes.</span></p>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although Anthropic has explicitly stated its refusal to accept Saudi Arabian investments, it does not plan to challenge funding from other sovereign wealth funds, including the United Arab Emirates&#8217; Mubadala. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to one source, Mubadala, based in the UAE, is actively considering an investment in Anthropic.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The potential buyers for FTX&#8217;s shares consist of a syndicate of new investors for Anthropic, excluding Amazon and Alphabet. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FTX&#8217;s stake is being marketed through special purpose vehicles (SPVs), which allow multiple investors to pool their capital. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fund is reportedly in discussions with venture firm Andreessen Horowitz to create a $40 billion fund dedicated to AI investments, as reported by CNBC based on sources familiar with the matter.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#8217;s ambitious &#8220;Vision 2030 Initiative&#8221; aims to modernize the economy and strengthen global financial ties. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anthropic&#8217;s national security concerns regarding Saudi Arabia may be related to dual-use technology, which refers to software or tech that can have both civilian and military applications. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This area of concern aligns with the focus of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which has the authority to block foreign investments from specific sources in certain sectors. </span></p>

<p><span>As <a href="http://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Bitcoin</a> continues to shape the cryptocurrency landscape, its influence extends to altcoins like <a href="https://tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/">Solana (SOL)</a>, which recently rebounded from the $170 mark, hinting at a potential end to the recent sell-off. </span></p>
<p><span>With Cathie Wood reiterating a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/bitcoin-price-prediction/#:~:text=As%20more%20and%20more%20people,by%20the%20end%20of%202025.">Bitcoin price prediction</a> of $1.5 million, the crypto market, including Solana, faces a transformative phase, underscored by increased institutional interest and bullish forecasts. </span></p>
<p><span>This backdrop sets a compelling stage for Solana&#8217;s next moves amidst evolving market sentiments and regulatory landscapes.</span></p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
On the technical front, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Solana&#8217;s</a> pivot point holds at $178.63 marks a decisive threshold, above which bullish momentum could be revitalized, targeting resistances at $196.10, $209.01, and $221.37.</p>
<p>Conversely, SOL finds immediate support at $165.46, with further cushions at $154.44 and $138.04, safeguarding against deeper corrections.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Set to be sentenced next week, disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is facing charges that carry a total maximum penalty of over 100 years in prison &#8211; but what sentence will he actually get?</span></p>
<p><span>In the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-court-documents-reveal-sam-bankman-frieds-strategies-to-repair-public-image.htm">defense’s sentencing recommendation</a> released late last month, Bankman-Fried’s camp pushed for a maximum prison sentence of just over six years, citing his age and “genuine concern” about other people.</span></p>
<h3>SBF Facing What Could Amount To A Life Sentence</h3>
<p><span>In their own sentencing recommendation released shortly thereafter, prosecutors argued that a six-year sentence </span><span>would be “woefully inaccurate” and “send the wrong message to the defendant, to others considering committing fraud, to victims, and to society at large,” recommending a prison term of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/cryptocurrency-scams.htm">40 to 50 years for the FTX fraudster</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>“Bankman-Fried’s crimes were serious and long-running, causing billions of dollars in losses and significant harm to tens of thousands of victims financially and emotionally,” prosecutors argued. “The sheer enormity of the loss in this case, and the fact that the loss came in the form of stealing of victims’ money, puts Bankman-Fried in a category of defendants where sentences of forty years or more is appropriate.”</span></p>
<p><span>Former U.S. Assistant Attorney and white-collar crime expert Kevin J. O&#8217;Brien thinks neither of those sentences is likely given that the presiding judge is Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, however.</span></p>
<p><span>“Kaplan’s tough &#8211; and he has that reputation &#8211; but he’s not nasty,” O’Brien said in an interview with Cryptonews. “I don’t think he’s effectively going to put the guy away for the rest of his adult life. He’s going to give him an opportunity to make amends and live a meaningful life outside of prison.”</span></p>
<h2>Is The Defense&#8217;s Argument Too Good To Be True?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>In their sentencing recommendation, the defense attempted to compare Bankman-Fried to “junk bond king” turned philanthropist Michael Milken and Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, who received 11 and seven years in prison, respectively.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry, but this is psychotic. I get that Sam Bankman-Fried is wildly unsympathetic. But there is no sane reason taxpayers need to keep him locked in a cage until he’s in his 80s. We are totally desensitized to excessively long prison terms in this country. <a href="https://t.co/5BHW7lCTDX">https://t.co/5BHW7lCTDX</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>O’Brien is unsure whether those comparisons will necessarily work in the eyes of the law, however.</span></p>
<p><span>“Those are smart arguments but there are differences between his case and those cases,” </span><span>said O’Brien, noting that the “size of the damage was much higher in his case.”</span></p>
<p><span>Similarly, O’Brien pointed out that Milken’s “good works” only occurred after his “exit from prison.”</span></p>
<p><span>“It’s kind of hard for Bankman-Fried to try to bank on that before he’s even sentenced,” O’Brien continued.</span></p>
<h2>Judge Kaplan Will Do What He Thinks Is Right, O&#8217;Brien Says</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>O’Brien’s comments come amid the March 20 appointment of <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/unabomber-prosecutor-to-conduct-ftx-probe-into-law-firm-sullivan-and-cromwells-conflicts-of-interest.htm">Unabomber prosecutor Robert J. Cleary</a> by a U.S. bankruptcy judge to probe into the collapse of FTX and its potential conflicts of interest with law firm Sullivan and Cromwell. </span></p>
<p><span>Current <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-to-face-independent-investigation-federal-appeals-court-rules.htm">FTX CEO John J. Ray III</a> has vocally opposed the approval of an independent examiner, citing current management’s independence from the FTX fraudsters.</span></p>
<p><span>“There’s a certain amount of politics here because of the responsibility of management for this mess,” O’Brien said of the legal saga, calling it “very much an issue.”</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to <a href="https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/about/overview/Overview_Federal_Sentencing_Guidelines.pdf">the parties’ sentencing recommendations</a>, Kaplan will have to follow the U.S. government’s federal sentencing guidelines. If he gives Bankman-Fried a sentence that is too much lower than the recommended punishment, the government could appeal his decision.</span></p>
<p><span>“Of course, Kaplan probably doesn’t care,” O’Brien said. “He’s going to do what he thinks is right.”</span></p>
<p><span>When asked how long Bankman-Fried&#8217;s sentence could be, O’Brien claimed he could see the former “king of crypto” land up to two decades in prison.</span></p>
<p><span>“I wouldn’t be surprised if Sam Bankman-Fried got 15 years,” he estimated.</span></p>
<p><span>The FTX founder is currently being held at Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. His sentencing is scheduled for March 28 in Manhattan.</span></p>
<p><span>Investigative findings from Cleary’s independent examination are due back in court within 60 days.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the Shiba Inu price consolidates near $0.26, not too far below the recent multi-year highs it hit earlier this month, Shiba Inu (SHIB) investors are pivoting to the latest ICO called Dogwifcat ($DWIFC) in search of 1000x returns.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu’s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/">market cap is $15.59 billion</a>, making it a strong contender for king of meme coins.</p>
<p>However, its high market cap raises concerns that the room for further upside might be limited.</p>
<p>No matter the Shiba Inu community’s efforts to build out the token’s utility, can a meme coin command a market cap of more than $50 billion?</p>
<p>Some fear that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/shiba-inu-price-prediction/">Shiba Inu’s</a> upside prospects may be limited to a maximum of 5x or less.</p>
<p>And in the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> sector, traders tend to look down their noses at the prospect of 5x gains.</p>
<p>Meme coin traders often prefer targeting coins that offer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/which-crypto-100x-potential-year.htm">potential gains in the region of 100x</a> or more.</p>
<p>One such coin they are likely taking a look is the latest ICO called <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogwifcat">Dogwifcat</a> ($DWIFC).</p>
<h2><strong>Latest ICO Dogwifcat ($DWIFC) Starts Life With a Bang</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The newest Solana meme coin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogwifcat">DogWifCat ($DWIFC)</a> launched earlier this week and has already soared 4,268% to $0.017 as frenzied buying accelerates.</p>
<figure id="attachment_188001" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188001" style="width: 865px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-188001 size-full" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22205035/1711140635-screenshot-2024-03-22-155018.png" alt="Shiba Inu Investors Pivot to Latest ICO Aiming for 1000x Returns" width="865" height="568" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22205035/1711140635-screenshot-2024-03-22-155018.png 865w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22205035/1711140635-screenshot-2024-03-22-155018-300x197.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22205035/1711140635-screenshot-2024-03-22-155018-768x504.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22205035/1711140635-screenshot-2024-03-22-155018-150x98.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-188001" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools</figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from bitcoin chalking up new all-time highs, the biggest story in crypto is the Solana juggernaut.</p>
<p>First, there was BONK then Dogwifhat, and more recently $SMOG, $BOME, and $SLERF.</p>
<p>Together, meme coins collectively demonstrate the robustness and value of the Solana blockchain. Now enter DogWifCat, which is already going parabolic less than 24 hours after launching.</p>
<p>Everyone in crypto now surely knows of the Wif-hat riff and its multiplying variants.</p>
<p>Well, DogWifCat is doing things a little differently from the rest of the pack by dispensing with the hat and going for a rhyming cat instead.</p>
<p>It has a definite ring to it, which counts for a lot in the meme coin world that is all about virality.</p>
<p>$DWIFC has raced to a market capitalization of $17.1 million from nowhere. 24-hour trading volumes currently sit at $5.44 million.</p>
<p>DogWifCat has a total token supply of 1 billion – the $DWIFC token address is <a href="https://birdeye.so/token/wifhHP4nsNmhXJx9Rrq9NFiYShUTFAreM5LKHso5qXK?chain=solana">wifhHP4nsNmhXJx9Rrq9NFiYShUTFAreM5LKHso5qXK</a>.</p>
<p>$DWIFC can be bought on <a href="https://jup.ag/swap/SOL-DWIFC_wifhHP4nsNmhXJx9Rrq9NFiYShUTFAreM5LKHso5qXK">Jupiter</a> or <a href="https://raydium.io/swap/?inputCurrency=sol&amp;outputCurrency=wifhHP4nsNmhXJx9Rrq9NFiYShUTFAreM5LKHso5qXK&amp;outputSymbol=DWIFC&amp;fixed=in">Raydium</a> decentralized exchanges by swapping SOL using Solana or a Solana-based token.</p>
<p>The present juncture in the market could be a good time to take profits on some of the other Solana token high-fliers such as $BONK, $MYRO, $BOME, and $SLERF, and rotate some of those mega-profits into <a href="https://www.dogwifcatcoin.io/">$DWIFC</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LayerZero co-founder and CEO Bryan Pellegrino accused Kyle Davies, co-founder of the now-defunct Three Arrows Capital (3AC), of trying to persuade his firm to transfer its entire treasury shortly before the liquidation of 3AC on March 21.</p>
<p>Pellegrino made the <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimordialAA/status/1770820900465602802">allegation in an X post</a> as a response to Davies&#8217; comment on a podcast.</p>
<h2>Pellegrino Asserts Davies Misled &amp; Exploited Partners</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Pellegrino alleged that Davies tried to get the entire treasury of LayerZero, &#8220;promising better rates than other borrowers as a last-gasp effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>This revelation came to light when the co-founder of the defunct hedge fund <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/3ac-co-founder-kyle-davies-stands-firm-wont-apologize-for-crypto-hedge-fund-bankruptcy.htm">refused to apologize to investors</a> for the collapse of 3AC in an episode of the Unchained YouTube interview podcast on March 19.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="3AC&#039;s Kyle Davies on Why He&#039;s Crypto&#039;s Lloyd Blankfein and Why He&#039;s Not Sorry - Ep. 621" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IEsjWV7GRgY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The LayerZero CEO further claimed that 3AC resolved to borrow funds from various firms, even though the firm knew it was financially unable to pay back the loans amid private preparation for its liquidation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I would agree with this 100% and would be in your corner except for the fact that you tried to get us to give you our entire treasury promising better rates than other borrowers as a last gasp effort just days before you blew up.</p>
<p>&mdash; Bryan Pellegrino (@PrimordialAA) <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimordialAA/status/1770819489577255278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Pellegrino criticized Davies for misleading and taking advantage of <a href="https://x.com/PrimordialAA/status/1770819601355411584?s=20">friends, associates, and partners, including Arthur Hayes</a>, the co-founder of BitMex exchange.</p>
<p>While Pellegrino’s accusations seem deep-rooted in betrayal and soured friendship, he has gained support from many crypto enthusiasts and case observers who believe Davies borrowed funds with false claims.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You borrowed money with fraudulent claims.  Thats simple financial fraud, and in a common sense ethical context…simple stealing.  Losing other peoples’ money isn’t inherently unethical or illegal.  But it’s both when you took their money under false pretenses.  Don’t apologize…</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Another X user, @basedkarbon, also <a href="https://x.com/basedkarbon/status/1770807566911566121?s=20">slammed Davies for not being tactful</a> with his response.</p>
<h2>The Fall of 3AC &amp; Impacts on the Crypto Sphere</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Davies and Su Zhu started 3AC in 2012, and the fund <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/06/16/crypto-crash-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-insolvency-rumors-novogratz/">reportedly managed an estimated $10 billion</a> in assets as of 2021. But, the value dropped to $3 billion in April 2022.</p>
<p>The major fall in the fortunes of 3AC was attributed to the crash of TerraUSD stablecoins in 2022, which led to a crypto crash that wiped out billions in value.</p>
<p>The now-defunct hedge fund <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22077923-three-arrows-capital-bankruptcy-filing?responsive=0&amp;title=1&amp;onlyshoworg=1%27">filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy</a> on July 1, 2022, to protect its assets from creditors.</p>
<p>The 3AC collapse had a severe impact on several investors and companies. This is because <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/three-arrows-capital-founders-face-13-billion-claim-from-liquidators.htm">3AC had a lengthy list of early and late counterparties</a> and organizations that had their funds wrapped up with the firm. The bankruptcy filing noted that the hedge fund owed $3.5 billion to 27 companies, including $2.3 billion to Genesis Global Trading.</p>
<p>Additionally, crypto trading platform Blockchain.com faced a $270 million hit on loans to 3AC, while renowned digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/voyager-digital-commences-financial-restructuring-process-to-maximize-value-for-all-stakeholders-301581177.html">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> due to a default on about $670 million in loans made to 3AC.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the crypto bull market matures, interest in web3 start-ups naturally continues to grow, with investors looking to diversify funds to some top Ethereum ICOs and presales.</p>
<p>The simplest way to get involved, and ideally make money, in crypto is simply by buying and holding major tokens.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC), last trading around $64,000, could well hit $100,000 this year. That’s thanks to a combination of tailwinds from spot ETF demand, the halving, and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fomc-interest-rate-decision-signals-all-clear-for-bitcoin-bull-run.htm">Fed rate cuts</a>.</p>
<p>Ether (ETH), despite <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-reportedly-probing-key-crypto-companies-in-push-to-make-eth-a-security-fortune.htm">regulatory uncertainty in the US</a>, could also hit all-time highs above $5,000. ETH was last in the $3,300s.</p>
<p>So HODLing blue-chip cryptos could deliver decent gains this year.</p>
<p>Investors and traders have also increasingly been turning their focus to smaller, lesser-known altcoins and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coins</a> this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/sol-solana/">Blockchains like Solana</a> and Avalanche have seen big price run-ups, partly driven by surging meme coin trading activity.</p>
<p>However, one often overlooked way to make a good return in crypto is by <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-presales.htm">investing in crypto start-up presales</a>.</p>
<p>A presale is where an up-and-coming web3 project that needs to raise funds for development launches an ICO.</p>
<p>These tokens are usually offered at a very favorable valuation, handing early presale investors the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/next-100x-crypto/">chance to make 100x gains</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s assuming that the web3 project delivers on its vision. Presale/ICO investing is, of course, very risky, much like traditional start-up investing is.</p>
<p>Ethereum is still the blockchain of choice for web3 start-ups to launch their tokens. That’s because Ethereum is the most liquid and widely used of all the major blockchains.</p>
<p>That being said, here are some of the top Ethereum ICOs and presales to watch right now.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Ethereum ICOs and Presales to Watch Right Now</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Umoja ($UMJA)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://umoja.xyz/">DeFi protocol Umoja</a>, which allows traders to tokenize their trading and yield-generating strategies, has already raised over $4 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The smart-money protocol is looking to raise another $6 million in cooperation with Ignition soon.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://twitter.com/UmojaProtocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UmojaProtocol</a> joins Ignition!</p>
<p>Another launch is approaching Ignition.</p>
<p>Umoja pioneers the world&#39;s first smart money protocol, empowering anyone to craft smart money. By integrating automated investment strategies into digital assets, Umoja enables tokens to autonomously… <a href="https://t.co/nKMxxFe4q9">pic.twitter.com/nKMxxFe4q9</a></p>
<p>&mdash; PAID NETWORK (@paid_network) <a href="https://twitter.com/paid_network/status/1770797687442460995?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Interest investors can register their account at <a href="https://t.co/VcA1WoVjom">ignition.paidnetwork.com</a>.</p>
<p>The project’s beta has already launched on Arbitrum and Ethereum, generating over $2.5 million in notional volume in just a month since its launch last month.</p>
<p>With all that said, Umoja could become a top Ethereum ICO.</p>
<h2><strong>Dogecoin20 ($DOGE20)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A promising new token called <a href="https://dogecoin20.io/">Dogecoin20</a> being watched by analysts at Cryptonews could be just the ticket.</p>
<p>Dogecoin20 is a rework of the meme coin Dogecoin beloved by <a href="https://x.com/dogeofficialceo/status/1768087572234793050">Elon Musk</a> that just launched in presale. It features the familiar Dogecoin brand but is based on Ethereum, and offers a staking option.</p>
<p>That means presale investors can generate an impressive passive income, <a href="https://dogecoin20.io/en/dashboard">which was around 156%</a>, per the project’s dashboard.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be surprising that the meme coin has already raised over $6 million.</p>
<p>Interested investors should move quickly to secure their tokens ahead of the next price rise when the $6.316 million mark is hit.</p>
<p>At a current price of $0.000202, investors are able to buy into the token at a hugely discounted valuation of under $30 million.</p>
<p>For a meme coin that could easily be 10x to above $300 million, or 100x to above $3 billion, investors are rushing to get involved.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20">Visit Dogecoin20 Here</a></strong></p>
<h2><strong>OrangeDX ($O4DX)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
OrangeDX ($O4DX), a multi-faceted Bitcoin native protocol that acts as a DEX, bridge, borrowing, lending, and yield-generating platform, is busily raising funds via an Ethereum ICO.</p>
<p>As per ICODrops, <a href="https://icodrops.com/orangedx/">it has raised 74% of its $2.24 million target</a>. As per its website, the <a href="https://orangedx.com/?utm_source=icodrops">$O4DX token will launch on Gate.io and MEXC</a> in just under four days.</p>
<p>That being said, OrangeDX could become a top Ethereum ICO.</p>
<h2><strong>GAIMIN ($GMRX)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Web3 gaming infrastructure project <a href="https://icodrops.com/gaimin/">GAIMIN ($GMRX) has raised $1.06 million</a>, as per ICODrops.</p>
<p>That is nearly 75% of its $1.46 million target raise. GAIMIN claims to be strategically positioned at the disruptive intersection of Web3, gaming, and cloud computing.</p>
<p>Its token is set to launch on Bybit, one of the world’s top crypto exchanges, on the 26 of March.</p>

<p>The hardware wallet also shared that only its X social media account was compromised and guaranteed the safety of all wallets for crypto transactions and storage.</p>
<h2>Trezor Confirms No Trezor Account or Funds Were Compromised</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/hackers-take-over-crypto-hardware-wallet-trezors-x-account-whats-going-on.htm">Cryptonews recently reported</a> the breach of Trezor’s X account when popular blockchain and crypto security investigator ZachXBT alerted his 533K followers about the compromise of the hardware wallet page.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Community alert: Trezor X/Twitter account is currently compromised <a href="https://t.co/hNm2OUjEgE">pic.twitter.com/hNm2OUjEgE</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Soon after, crypto security firm Scam Sniffer <a href="https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1770227728014614913">detected the suspicious activity</a> and warned crypto traders to steer clear.</p>
<p>According to SatoshiLab’s <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/update-addressing-concerns-around-our-recent-x-twitter-account-breach-a888bc349007">detailed report</a> via Medium, the unauthorized access to their X account was identified at 11:53 PM on March 19, scaling past a series of security protocols, including two-factor authentication (2FA) and a strong password.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Update on our X account security incident<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Earlier this week, we experienced a breach of our X account due to a sophisticated phishing attack.</p>
<p>Immediate actions were taken to secure our account &amp; no product security was compromised.</p>

<p>&mdash; Trezor (@Trezor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1770825552628220128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the hardware wallet producers stated that all compromises have been resolved, and accounts on its ecosystem were safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to stress here that the security of all our products remains unaffected,&#8221; SatoshiLabs said. &#8220;This incident has not impacted or compromised the security of Trezor hardware wallets or our other products. Your Trezor device and Trezor Suite remain safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the hardware wallet’s X account was used to promote a $TRZR presale on the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/how-to-buy-solana/">Solana blockchain</a> network during the breach, to deceive traders into sending funds into a Solana wallet.</p>
<p>The post also mentioned a new <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/slerf-price-prediction-as-solana-meme-coin-sees-1-4-billion-trading-volume-in-24-hours-can-it-overtake-shiba-inu.htm">Solana memecoin named Slerf</a> to attract more attention and directed crypto investors to click on a malicious link designed to connect to their wallets and wipe off all assets and funds stored. These posts were deleted shortly after.</p>
<p>Popular Web3 security investigator John Holmquist said the hardware wallet breach was due to neglecting to implement two-factor authentication (2FA).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trezor is not having a presale.</p>
<p>Trezor&#39;s account is compromised&#8230;</p>
<p>Good time to mention you can use a Trezor as a security key for 2FA to secure your Twitter account?</p>
<p>Absolutely major L from a security company, please take account security more seriously. <a href="https://t.co/ZQtgqdRx6G">pic.twitter.com/ZQtgqdRx6G</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This was off the mark, however, as SatoshiLab highlighted that its X account had<a href="https://x.com/Trezor/status/1771171273344778444?s=20"> 2FA and other security measures</a> active. It is still unknown if there will be an impending investigation to identify the perpetrator(s).</p>
<h2>Trezor Asserts Phishing Attack Was in the Works for Weeks</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
SatoshiLab further stressed that the official X account breach was a complex and calculated <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/over-580000-drained-in-phishing-scams-targeting-web3-firms-whats-going-on.htm">phishing attack</a> that had been in the works for weeks.</p>
<p>The company’s investigation revealed that the plan kicked off on February 29, 2024. The bad actors created a faux entity in the crypto sector that convinced members of crypto communities of its high reputation.</p>
<p>Although the entity&#8217;s name was left out in the report, it was noted that the bad actor participated in genuine crypto conversations to boost its media presence, grew their followership to thousands, and reached out to SatoshiLab&#8217;s PR team for an interview with the wallet firm’s CEO.</p>
<p>This led to a meeting being set up and a malicious link being shared under the guise of a Calendly invitation. The firm’s PR team member clicked the link and was directed to a page asking for X login details, which raised red flags and halted initial plans for an interview and a suggested reschedule.</p>
<p>During the rescheduled meeting, the attacker notified Trezor’s team members of technical issues and urged for a call authorization, which linked the attacker’s Calendly app with SatoshiLab’s X account.</p>
<p>The breach then enabled the bad actors to promote fraudulent crypto and malicious links on behalf of the hardware wallet. This was what ZachXBT detected, which made him alert his followers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Unabomber prosecutor Robert J. Cleary has been given the green light by a U.S. bankruptcy judge to probe law firm Sullivan and Cromwell’s potential conflicts of interests in relation to FTX, according to a Wednesday court filing.</span></p>
<h2>What Will Cleary Find in FTX Probe?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Cleary’s appointment by Judge John Dorsey marks a key shift in the examination of the FTX’s collapse, formally reversing his rejection of an independent examiner in February 2023. </span><span>Sullivan and Cromwell spearheaded the doomed <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/what-is-cryptocurrency/">crypto exchange</a> through its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and has since charged over $170 million for its services.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Do you have Unabomber prosecutor probing Sullivan &amp; Cromwell on your 2024 FTX bingo card? <a href="https://t.co/Da6ADWnvTp">pic.twitter.com/Da6ADWnvTp</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Nicholas Hall (@nicholashall) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicholashall/status/1771166128540168622?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>Last month, a number of FTX investors filed a <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/mopalwrljva/Garrison%20v.%20Sullivan%20Cromwell%20-%20complaint.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> against the law firm, noting Sullivan and Cromwell’s “conduct and participation” in “racketeering activity” with Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange. </span></p>
<p><span>Investors claimed that through the firm’s advisement to FTX through 2021 and 2022, Sullivan and Cromwell “placed itself in a unique position to gain deep insight into the FTX entities’ convoluted organizational structure, abject lack of internal controls, and dubious business practice.”</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, they alleged that the law firm “vouched for the solvency, safety, and security of the FTX Group up until its very collapse,” misleading customers and investors regarding the exchange.</span></p>
<p><span>“Despite this knowledge, S&amp;C stood to gain financially from the FTX Group’s misconduct and so agreed, at least impliedly, to assist that unlawful conduct for its own gain,” the filing continued.</span></p>
<h2>FTX&#8217;s Collapse Prompts Conflict of Interest Concerns</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>News of Cleary’s approval comes just two months after a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-to-face-independent-investigation-federal-appeals-court-rules.htm">federal appeals court</a> mandated the reversal of Dorsey’s February 2023 decision, citing added security to the crypto sector as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span>“The collapse of FTX caused catastrophic losses for its worldwide investors but also raised implications for the evolving and volatile cryptocurrency industry,” said Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo. “For example, an investigation into FTX Group’s use of its own cryptocurrency tokens, FTTs, to inflate the value of FTX and Alameda Research could bring this practice under further scrutiny, thereby alerting potential investors to undisclosed credit risks in other cryptocurrency companies.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>Critics of <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-hickenlooper-tillis-lummis_raise-conflict-of-interest-concerns-about-law-firms-role-in-ftx-bankruptcy-investigation-urge-court-to-appoint-independent-examiner">FTX’s collapse</a> have long called for such an examination, with Senators John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) penning a letter to Dorsey in January 2023 for an “objective investigation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;As legal counsel is often central to major financial scandals, given their role in drafting financial agreements, risk management compliance practices, and corporate controls, it is perfectly reasonable to have concerns about the impartiality and manner that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell will approach any investigation of FTX with,” the senators wrote.</span></p>
<h2>Going Forward with FTX Probe</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Meanwhile, current <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/ftx-users-seek-return-of-crypto-assets-not-dollars.htm">FTX CEO John J. Ray III</a> has pushed back against the appointment of an independent examiner, claiming the crypto company is now fully independent from the convicted fraudsters. </span></p>
<p><span>Cleary is set to return a report detailing his investigative findings on FTX’s collapse within sixty days. </span><span>Bankman-Fried is currently scheduled for sentencing on March 28 in Manhattan federal court.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With major cryptocurrencies struggling on Friday as focus returns to heavy and largely GBTC-driven spot Bitcoin ETF outflows, traders looking to turn quick exponential profits continue to flock to the on-chain shitcoin markets as they hunt for top crypto gainers today.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">has been up by 2.5% in the past 24 hours</a>, as per CoinMarketCap, and trading in the mid-$63,000s.</p>
<p>Other major cryptos Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), and <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/ripple/">XRP</a> (XRP) dropped as much as 5% over the same time period.</p>
<p>As per Zerohedge, GBTC is now down to 356,000 BTC from 619,000 BTC just two months ago.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">GBTC only has 356K bitcoins left to liquidate, down from 619K two months ago</p>
<p>&mdash; zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1770832037496107307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Traders have been dumping GBTC since it converted into a spot ETF.</p>
<p>That’s because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its comparatively high fee (of 1.5%),</li>
<li>Traders who bought GBTC at a big discount to NAV in 2023 before it converted to an ETF taking profit,</li>
<li>Bankrupt crypto companies (like FTX, Celsius, and BlockFi) liquidating holdings.</li>
</ul>
<p>While <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etfs-see-fourth-consecutive-day-of-net-outflows.htm">GBTC sell pressure could persist in the short term</a>, this is unlikely to be a long-term headwind to the market.</p>
<p>Major cryptos are thus likely to recover and hit new highs later this year, with Bitcoin bulls eyeing $100,000.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, impatient traders looking to turn faster profits will continue to enter the on-chain markets.</p>
<p>On-chain markets refer to the market for digital assets that have been issued directly on top of an existing blockchain.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/shiba-inu-price-prediction/">Shiba Inu (SHIB) token</a> is issued on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.</p>
<p>These tokens can then be traded on decentralized exchanges (<a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-decentralized-exchanges/">DEX</a>), and also perhaps on centralized exchanges if they get big enough.</p>
<p>They are often referred to as <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/best-meme-coins.htm">meme coin</a> (or shitcoin) markets and virtually anyone can issue a token at any time.</p>
<p>As a result, these <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/cryptocurrency-scams.htm">on-chain markets are replete with scams</a> and pump-and-dump schemes.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://cryptonews.com/cryptocurrency/best-shitcoins-buy/">shitcoin markets</a> are the only place to find tokens that can rally in the 50-100x region.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the top crypto gainers today on Solana that traders will be monitoring, as per <a href="https://dexscreener.com/">DEXScreener</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Crypto Gainers Today</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Stop ($STOP)</strong></h3>
<p>A just-launched anti-racism token called Stop ($STOP), which appears to be campaigning against racist tokens being launched on Solana, is <a href="https://dexscreener.com/solana/f5ixin6eufpsqllxw8mt1blt9ebytkmfywgrq9ggqgyx">up 130,000% in the past 24 hours</a>, as per DEXScreener.</p>
<p>The token’s market cap was last $2.2 million, with $120,000 in locked liquidity.</p>
<p>It has also seen an impressive $9.5 million in trading volumes since its launch.</p>
<p>But just because the token seems innocent and well-meaning, that doesn’t mean it isn’t a scam.</p>
<p>Traders must always do their due diligence in the on-chain shitcoin markets. Most tokens are scams or pump-and-dump schemes.</p>
<h3><strong>Doege ($DOEGE)</strong></h3>
<p>A fun alternative version of Dogecoin called Doege ($DOEGE) is pumping on Solana on Friday.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://dexscreener.com/solana/4mjx8zfxorlni7xa2cg1qlrnn1lgzi9rtn2xewtry4rv">went up 35,600% in 24 hours</a> as per DEXScreener.</p>
<p>But its market cap remains modest at just $800,000, with $100,000 in locked liquidity.</p>
<p>It seems to have decent community support though, with 563 “rocket” votes on DEXScreener versus 28 “shitcoin” and “40” red flag votes.</p>
<h3><strong>Thicc ($THICC)</strong></h3>
<p>A shitcoin called $THICC has pumped up 130% in 24 hours, reaching a market cap of $2.7 million.</p>
<p>That’s according to DEXScreener, which puts <a href="https://dexscreener.com/solana/6sfvpj2wkgkeyqe4dumeoxeumtmdoj75uclbn5h4utya">the token’s 24-hour volumes at a massive $30 million</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, over 10,000 unique wallets have traded the pair, an impressive feat.</p>
<p>But investors should never ape into a coin purely because of impressive numbers. Always do your own research first.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Investing in low-cap shitcoins is a very risky strategy.</p>
<p>An innocent-looking project could easily turn out to be a scam, and a few big sell orders could easily drive the price 80% lower.</p>
<p>A strategy that is still risky, but arguably has a better risk reward is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">getting involved in crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>The idea is that investors secure tokens of up-and-coming, high-potential crypto projects/protocols at a discounted early price.</p>
<p>These projects then put those funds to work, paying for protocol development and marketing.</p>
<p>While lots can go wrong when investing in crypto presales—unforeseen circumstances can prevent a project from delivering on its vision—savvy presale investors routinely secure gains of 10x or more.</p>
<p>With hundreds of presale projects vying for investor funds, analysts at Cryptonews have been combing the market.</p>
<p>Here are 14 of the presale projects with the highest potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meme Coin markets have become the fastest-growing opportunity in finance this month, and retail investors are now scrambling to find new meme coins to secure big profits.</p>
<p>The frenzied meme coin season was triggered early in 2024, when the now iconic Solana meme coin DogWifHat (WIF) token exploded onto a multi-billion dollar market cap.</p>
<p>In the weeks since crypto markets have gone parabolic as millions of investors around the world race to find new meme coins to make it big.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<h2><strong>Biggest Meme Coin Market Rug Pulls &#8211; March 22</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, with the statistics showing that the majority of Solana meme coin launches lose investors money &#8211; is this a smart money game for schmucks? Let&#8217;s unpack some of today&#8217;s biggest rug pulls.</p>
<h2><strong>Rug Pull #1 &#8211; Based Wojak (BOJAK)</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-187886" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22165219/1711126338-bojak_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-03-22_16-51-46.png" alt="" width="1473" height="631" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22165219/1711126338-bojak_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-03-22_16-51-46.png 1473w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22165219/1711126338-bojak_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-03-22_16-51-46-300x129.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22165219/1711126338-bojak_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-03-22_16-51-46-1024x439.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22165219/1711126338-bojak_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-03-22_16-51-46-768x329.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22165219/1711126338-bojak_usd-uni-dextools-io_2024-03-22_16-51-46-150x64.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1473px) 100vw, 1473px" /></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/base/pair-explorer/0x9421103043c1716211614a06ede9ce493b8eeed8?t=1711125590946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return</a> to classic ERC-20 meme coin architecture, BOJAK is an intrepid meme coin setting out to make it big in a double-edged play on 2023&#8217;s memorable WOJAK token &#8211; rebirthed (at least in name) into the BASE blockchain trend.</p>
<p>However, despite a massive influx of $1.14m in 24-hour trading volume, and surging up a whopping +53,687% at its peak &#8211; BOJAK has almost completely bled out over the afternoon &#8211; leaving more than 2,000 holders in despair.</p>
<h2><strong>Rug Pull #2 &#8211; Pnut (PNUT) </strong></h2>

<p>Next up, a new Solana meme coin called PNUT &#8211; a ticker play on the word peanut &#8211; briefly exploded on Raydium DEX markets with a <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/AS98jKn9RdGYn3MzAiTmUDDPcoWCjdhDfYgwsX8dppP2?t=1711125599777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">+145,228%</a> rally to an all-time high suckering in almost 2,000 traders.</p>
<p>Yet, a near-complete retracement has seen the majority of PNUT holders left underwater, with prices collapsing -97.5%, leaving PNUT market cap low at $332k.</p>

<p>Last but not least, another Solana meme coin that witnessed a seismic rug pull today is the Shrek token &#8211; a light-hearted play on everyone&#8217;s favorite Ogre.</p>
<p>Amid impressive $2.3m trading volumes, SHREK shot up an initial <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/solana/pair-explorer/GfmbURngNb8srksiVDTmBp5EhvrdCdNhUHHNsDd9M8KP?t=1711125644507" target="_blank" rel="noopener">+62,482%</a> &#8211; to reach lofty heights around $0.034 &#8211; before falling victim to a tumultuous -98.75% drop that has left 1,190 holders short-changed.</p>
<h2><strong>Looking For A Safe New Meme Coin Play With Big Potential Returns?</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Then look no further than the viral <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/dogecoin20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dogecoin20 presale</a>, which has exploded in just three days to hit a jaw-dropping $6M raised.</p>
<p>With DOGE20 hitting terminal velocity throughout today, the Dogecoin20 presale looks poised for an explosive weekend ahead as investors rush to position for early-bird advantage in the fastest-growing meme coin presale.<span></span></p>
<p>A replica play on the biggest meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), the real appeal of Dogecoin20 lies in the opportunity to buy the next DOGE at just 0.0001% of Dogecoin’s market cap.</p>
<p>Stop a second to imagine the possibilities &#8211; if DOGECOIN20 replicates just 1% of Dogecoin’s success, and hits a $192M market cap – investors could be walking away with life-changing 50x returns &#8211; all without the overhead risk of a rug pull as seen in straight to DEX launches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Worldcoin Orb has open-sourced some of its eyeball-scanning technology in a bid by founders to verify its claims to data privacy, according to a Friday blog post.</p>
<p>Developers can now review the software components of the Worldcoin Orb on Github, where it has been made publicly available under an MIT/Apache 2.0 dual license.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Worldcoin Orb</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The reveal adds to the organization’s pre-existing <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/engineering/opening-orb-look-inside-worldcoin-biometric-imaging-device">hardware</a> and <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/engineering/open-sourcing-worldcoin-iris-recognition-pipeline">iris recognition</a> repositories made available in January 2023 and December 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>“Their public availability marks significant progress in making the Orb’s image processing transparent and its privacy claims verifiable,” <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/engineering/worldcoin-foundation-open-sources-core-components-orb-software">the Worldcoin Foundation wrote</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/traders-expect-more-pump-on-worldcoin-and-fetch-ai-but-milei-moneda-has-immediate-appeal.htm">Worldcoin (WLD)</a> is a crypto project designed to distribute digital tokens to every human being on the planet, creating the foundation for a universal basic income scheme.</p>
<p>Doing so requires verifying “humanness” – that each user of the network is actually a one-of-a-kind person, and not <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/how-artificial-intelligence-ai-could-start-to-boost-crypto-crime-chainalysis.htm">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> or a duplicate.</p>
<p>Hence, the foundation is spreading a vast network of Worldcoin Orbs throughout the globe, where network participants can peer into the orb, have their iris scanned, verify their identity, and receive tokens.</p>
<h2>Ensuring Data Privacy Through Open-Source</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, given the ominous nature of “orbs” and “eyeball scanning,” its founders – including Sam Altman – have received massive criticism from the crypto community for what seems to many like a massive privacy invasion/surveillance tool.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This looks like it produces a global (hash) database of people&#39;s iris scans (for &quot;fairness&quot;), and waves away the implications by saying &quot;we deleted the scans!&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah, but you save the *hashes* produced by the scans. Hashes that match *future* scans. </p>
<p>Don&#39;t catalogue eyeballs. <a href="https://t.co/uAk0NYGeZu">https://t.co/uAk0NYGeZu</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to the Foundation, privacy and security were top priorities in the Orb’s construction.</p>
<p>“One privacy-critical step is sending individual data from the Orb to World App for a feature called &#8216;Personal Custody&#8217;. Individuals can use this self-custodied data, for example, for Face Authentication in World App,” they stated.</p>
<p>The Foundation added that it may reduce the frequency in which users must visit the orb to re-verify their identity in the future.</p>
<p>A white-box <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-08-worldcoin-orb-securityreview.pdf">audit report by Trail of Bits</a> found that the Orb collects no personally identifiable information from its users besides an Iris code. It also said that it collects no information from users’ devices that have the World App installed.</p>
<p>“Further audits are underway and, combined with open sourcing, reflect the Foundation’s aim to maintain a continuously high level of transparency around privacy and security,” the Foundation stated.</p>
<p>The WLD token has risen $3.45 to $8.16 over the past three months. In February, the foundation revealed that <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sam-altmans-worldcoin-surges-170-in-a-week-with-1-million-daily-users.htm">World App’s daily active user count has crossed 1 million</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FTX users are suing the now-defunct Silvergate by claiming it abetted FTX and its affiliated trading firm Alameda Research to commit a historic fraud.</p>
<p>According to the customers launching the suit, FTX knowingly transferred customer money into Alameda Research. FTX is currently on trial for numerous offences related to fraud and money laundering charges.</p>
<p>Central to the case is the allegation that FTX illegally wired Alameda Research customer funds to cover the cracks in its balance sheet after the trading company made some risky crypto bets.</p>
<p>On March 20, Judge <span>Ruth Bermudez Montenegro of a San Diego federal court </span>filed an <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67659723/25/bhatia-v-silvergate-bank/">order</a> denying Silvergate&#8217;s motion to dismiss the case.</p>
<p>Montenegro ruled that the customers had adequately presented a case for Silvergate knowing and participating in FRX&#8217;s fraud in their filing on March 19.</p>
<p data-ct-non-breakable="true">“It was foreseeable that allowing FTX customer funds to be deposited into non-FTX accounts would lead to fraud and harm the owners of those funds,” said the order.</p>
<p>The numbers ostensibly speak for themselves. According to the order, Silvergate’s annual income before taking on FTX as a client was $7.6 million. The bank&#8217;s post-FTX income was nearly ten times higher, at $75.5 million, through transaction fees and interest on money deposited in FTX and Alameda accounts.</p>
<p><span>The court also ruled that Silvergate&#8217;s earlier assertion that it doesn&#8217;t owe a duty of care to FTX customers is incorrect. Silvergate&#8217;s argument rests on the fact that the bank was not directly responsible for the withdrawal freezes that spread panic when FTX began to collapse. </span></p>
<p><span>The bank also argued that had it not dealt with FTX, the exchange would have found another bank, an assertion that the judge labeled called “highly speculative” because Silvergate “one of few banks willing to service the crypto industry.”</span></p>
<h2>Like Silvergate: 3AC Also Denies Wrongdoing</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Another company at the heart of 2022&#8217;s industry-wide recession, dubbed &#8220;crypto winter&#8221;, came under media scrutiny <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/3ac-co-founder-kyle-davies-stands-firm-wont-apologize-for-crypto-hedge-fund-bankruptcy.htm">this week</a> after its co-founder denied responsibility in the collapse.</p>
<p><span>Kyle Davies, the founder of collapsed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) told his interviewer in the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEsjWV7GRgY&amp;ab_channel=Unchained">latest episode</a><span> of Unchained that he feels he has nothing to apologise for. </span></p>
<p><span>“Am I sorry for a company going bankrupt? No, like companies go bankrupt, almost every company goes bankrupt, right?” reasoned Davies, in response to criticisms that he had shown no remorse when his company failed. </span></p>
<p><span>In May 2022, a huge crypto project called Terra collapsed when its dollar-pegged stablecoin UST slipped its peg and spiralled down to nothing. </span></p>
<p><span>Terra sold UST on the promise that an algorithm could peg it to the greenback by burning $1 dollars worth of a sister token called LUNA to create it. In order to redeem it, holders burned UST for equivalent amounts of LUNA. </span></p>
<p><span>The mechanism failed, however, after too many people exited UST at once, causing the algorithm to nosedive into a hyper-inflationary spiral. </span></p>
<p><span>At the time when Terra collapsed, 3AC had </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/11/how-the-fall-of-three-arrows-or-3ac-dragged-down-crypto-investors.html#:~:text=3AC%20told%20the%20Wall%20Street,when%20the%20stablecoin%20project%20failed.">$200 million to half a billion</a><span> LUNA tokens. The industry-wide contagion from UST&#8217;s historic depegging is also considered a factor in FTX&#8217;s downfall. </span></p>

Although the potential behind blockchain technology is huge, a number of setbacks may hamper adoption however.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, the “</span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/solution-blockchain-trilemma.htm"><span>blockchain trilemma</span></a><span>” continues to be one of the biggest challenges for Web3 developers and users alike. </span></p>
<p><span>The blockchain trilemma refers to the notion that it may be impossible to achieve everything blockchain promises – which is decentralization, security, and scalability. This is because increasing one of these elements often leads to the weakening of another. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Blockchain trillema.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s educate ourselves on it to understand how it works in order to protect ourselves from any manipulation.</p>
<p>The blockchain trilemma is a concept coined by Vitalik Buterin that proposes a set of three main issues,decentralization, security and scalability <a href="https://t.co/6v8Vd8XrfQ">pic.twitter.com/6v8Vd8XrfQ</a></p>

<h2><b>Can Parallelized EVMs Solve Blockchain Trilemma?</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>While the blockchain trilemma has existed for years, new solutions are being implemented to address these challenges.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span>For example, </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/evms-evolve-with-parallelized-technology.htm"><span>parallelized Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVMs)</span></a><span> are a recent development that seeks to fix scalability issues plaguing the Ethereum network. </span></p>
<p><span>Tom McClean, Senior Researcher at decentralized exchange Vega Protocol, told Cryptonews that a </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/guides/what-is-a-smart-contract.htm"><span>traditional EVM network</span></a><span> – such as Ethereum and many of its layer-2 networks (L2s) – requires all transactions to be processed sequentially. </span></p>
<p><span>But McClean noted that processing transactions one after the other reduces hardware requirements, limits transaction throughput, and doesn&#8217;t take advantage of modern advances in multi-core processing. </span></p>
<p><span>“Parallelized EVMs attempt to reduce this problem by running transactions in parallel, which can theoretically significantly increase processing speed,” said McClean. “This can lead to a generally faster blockchain.” </span></p>
<p><span>Given this potential, Matt Ballensweig, Head of Go Network – a digital asset settlement solution from BitGo – told Cryptonews that parallelized EVMs have the ability to solve the blockchain trilemma. </span></p>
<p><span>“Parallelized EVMs radically reduce transaction latency, allow for much lower transaction fees and create space for interoperability,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Ballensweig noted that platforms like Neon, Sei Network, and Monad are all working on </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-market-turns-spotlight-on-parallelized-evm-trend-for-enhanced-blockchain-scalability.htm"><span>parallelized EVM solutions</span></a><span> to make networks like Solana and Ethereum interoperable and more performant. </span></p>
<h2><b>Neon Parallelized EVM to Bring dApps to Solana </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Sukanya Parashar, Senior Integration Engineer at Neon, told Cryptonews that </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/neon-evm-launches-feature-to-pay-transaction-fees-with-different-tokens-on-testnet.htm"><span>Neon EVM is the first EVM live o</span><span>n Solana mainnet</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>According to Parashar, Neon&#8217;s parallelized EVM solution enables concurrent transaction processing without compromising the security and decentralization of the network – essentially solving the blockchain trilemma. </span></p>
<p><span>Parashar explained that this is made possible by utilizing a state sharding mechanism, which splits blockchain data into partitions. </span></p>
<p><span>“This solution aims to solve the scalability bottleneck, allowing for a higher transaction throughput while maintaining a decentralized consensus,” said Parashar. </span></p>
<p><span>She added that the goal behind Neon EVM is to allow Ethereum-based dApps to be deployed on Solana without any code changes. This would also enable developers and users to leverage scalability and parallel processing from the Solana network. </span></p>
<p><span>“Multiple dApps spanning across decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming have already launched on Neon EVM,” said Parashar. “Among these dApps, some are native to Neon EVM while others are pre-existing dApps from the EVM ecosystem that have expanded to Neon EVM to leverage Solana&#8217;s liquidity and its network benefits.”</span></p>
<p><span>This is important, as Parashar shared that a large portion of Solana&#8217;s user base, liquidity, and community remains unt</span><span>apped by EVM-based dApps. </span></p>
<p><span>Parashar hopes that Neon’s parallelized EVM solution can solve this, as she pointed out that Solana is the largest non-EVM ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span>“It’s the fourth largest chain by Total Value Locked, with over 20 million monthly active users and a well matured DeFi ecosystem,” she said. “In essence, we believe that Neon EVM is the easiest way to access Solana for EVM dApps.”</span></p>
<h2><b>Sei Labs Working On Interoperable Parallelized EVM</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Startup Sei Labs has also recently introduced a parallelized EVM called “Sei V2.” A </span><a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/"><span>blog post describing the solution notes</span></a><span>, “Sei V2 is Sei’s first major upgrade to become the first fully parallelized EVM.”</span></p>
<p><span>Head of Marketing at Sei Labs – who goes by the name of “Grover &#8221; – told Cryptonews that Sei V2 already contains a number of unique features. </span></p>
<p><span>“The first is ‘Twin Turbo Consensus,’ which allows Sei to reach the fastest time to finality of any blockchain, unlocking web2 like experiences for applications,” he said. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">90% of Ethereum transaction time is spent on consensus. Sei&#39;s twin-turbo consensus greatly enhances this process, leading to unprecedented efficiency.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>Grover added that optimistic parallelization within Sei V2 allows developers to unlock parallel processing for Ethereum applications without additional work. This means that Sei’s EVM solution is  fully interoperable. </span></p>
<p><span>Grover further shared that the Sei database is a major upgrade that will eventually allow Sei to handle a much higher rate of data storage. This is critical for a high performance blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span>“The Sei mainnet launch will happen in quarter two of this year,” Grover remarked. </span></p>
<h2><b>Monad introduces Optimistic Parallel Execution </b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>Keone Hon, CEO and Co-Founder of Monad, told Cryptonews that “Optimistic Parallel Execution” is one of several major improvements that </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/monad-devnet-launches-with-scalability-promise-could-it-push-ethereum-technology-to-new-heights.htm"><span>Monad has introduced in order to hyperscale the EVM</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>While it’s still in development, Hon pointed out that Optimistic Parallel Execution can be explained in two stages. </span></p>
<p><span> </span><span>“In the first stage, many transactions run in parallel as if they were all starting from the same initial state,” said Hon. “For each transaction, Monad executes bytecode, pulls dependencies from disk, and writes a pending result with a record of the input and output state variables for that transaction.”</span></p>
<p><span>In the second stage, Hon explained that pending results are then committed in the original order of the transactions.</span></p>
<p><span>“Each pending result is immediately accepted if its inputs are unchanged, or immediately re-executed if any inputs have been altered,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, Hon believes that Monad is capable of achieving the same end state as if transactions were running sequentially. In other words, the feature will introduce major time savings.  </span></p>
<p><span>“This ensures total backwards compatibility with Ethereum,” Hon remarked. “Performant parallel execution requires addressing the biggest bottleneck for execution, which is state access.”</span></p>
<p><span>Hon shared that these optimizations for the Ethereum community will be made available later this year. </span></p>
<h2><b>Risks Involved with Parallelized EVMs</b></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>While the promise of parallelized EVMs is notable, a number of risks are involved with these solutions.</span></p>
<p><span>“</span><span>Though parallelized EVMs have a lot of upside and are quickly evolving and integrating into the broader ecosystem, there are certain risks that need to be carefully mitigated such as increased technical complexity and potential security factors,” said </span><span>Ballensweig.</span></p>
<p><span>Parashar explained that</span> <span>challenges in parallel processing stem from the inherent complexity of implementation in computing systems. </span></p>
<p><span>“Multitasking and multiprocessor setups introduce more points of failure,” she said. “In blockchain networks, like Solana, parallel transaction execution increases system complexity, leading to potential bugs and outages.”</span></p>
<p><span>Given this, Parashar commented that ensuring accurate state updates across multiple threads is crucial to prevent invalid changes. </span></p>
<p><span>She added that general issues related to parallel and concurrent computing exacerbate complexity, especially in blockchain networks that contain cryptographic elements.</span></p>
<p><span>Grover pointed out that the biggest challenge for Sei will be to upgrade the Sei blockchain network with the upcoming parallelized EVM features. </span></p>
<p><span>“This will be like changing the wings on a plane in-flight, but Sei Labs is up to the task,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span>Yet Alejo Pinto, Co-Founder and Chief Growth Officer at EVM-product development studio Pontem, expressed skepticism.</span></p>
<p><span>“Parallelized EVM is an iterative improvement, but relatively untested,” said Pinto. “It enables all code built with EVM to be ported over.”</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, Pinto believes that alternative virtual machines, like parallelized EVMs, still need to be tested in production before developers and users will feel comfortable adopting them. </span></p>

<p>As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to struggle in the face of continued elevated outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), traders hunting for quick returns are parsing through the altcoin markets for the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<p>After popping momentarily above $68,000 on Wednesday following a dovish Fed meeting, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a> has since slipped to the $63,000s.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etfs-see-fourth-consecutive-day-of-net-outflows.htm">Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows every day this week</a>. That’s thanks to a slowdown in inflows into the likes of BlackRock’s IBIT and an <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/gbtc-bleeds-another-443-million-as-bitcoin-price-drops-below-61000.htm">uptick in GBTC outflows</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thursday saw the biggest bitcoin ETF inflows in 3 days: besides the constant GBTC outflows which will end once the fund hits 0, no other fund was selling and IBIT jumped (BITO is futures) <a href="https://t.co/hBG8Aok2xK">pic.twitter.com/hBG8Aok2xK</a></p>
<p>&mdash; zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1771136755439161591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As per Zerohedge, GBTC is now down to 356,000 BTC from 619,000 BTC just two months ago.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">GBTC only has 356K bitcoins left to liquidate, down from 619K two months ago</p>
<p>&mdash; zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1770832037496107307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Traders having been dumping GBTC since it converted into a spot ETF. That’s because of its 1) comparatively high fee (of 1.5%), 2) traders who bought GBTC at a big discount to NAV in 2023 before it converted to an ETF taking profit and 3) bankrupt crypto companies (like FTX, Celsius and BlockFi) liquidating holdings.</p>
<p>While GBTC sell pressure could persist in the short term, this is unlikely to be a long-term headwind to the market.</p>
<p>Now might be a good time to accumulate Bitcoin in the $60,000s, before it potentially rallies towards $100,000 before the year’s end.</p>
<p>Bitcoin could easily be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Best Crypto to Buy Today</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Aptos (APT)</strong></h3>
<p>Much hyped layer-1 blockchain protocol Aptos (APT) is probing its highest levels for more than 1-year.</p>
<p>APT was last up 10% on Friday in the $16s, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>The token is eyeing a quick retest of its 2023 highs above $20.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-187962" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22185420/1711133660-screenshot-2024-03-22-114025.png" alt="" width="820" height="709" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22185420/1711133660-screenshot-2024-03-22-114025.png 820w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22185420/1711133660-screenshot-2024-03-22-114025-300x259.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22185420/1711133660-screenshot-2024-03-22-114025-768x664.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/22185420/1711133660-screenshot-2024-03-22-114025-150x130.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px" /></p>
<p>Aptos was developed by a team of well-connected ex-Facebook employees who were behind the social media platform’s failed Libra cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Aptos could become a leading blockchain in the coming years.</p>
<p>That suggests its market cap of $6.3 billion and fully diluted market cap of $17.5 billion could be undervalued.</p>
<p>Aptos could well be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Internet Computer (ICP)</strong></h3>
<p>Up nearly 10% in 24 hours, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/">Internet Computer (ICP)</a> is one of the best-performing cryptos on Friday.</p>
<p>ICP for now remains stuck in its multi-week $10-16 range.</p>
<p>That leaves it still down over 96% down from its record peaks from 2021 around $350.</p>
<p>Its modest market cap of currently just $6.2 billion suggests there is plenty of room for growth.</p>
<p>ICP may not hit its 2021 highs soon, but 10x gains are certainly on the cards. That means it could easily be the best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h3><strong>Fantom (FTM)</strong></h3>
<p>Layer-1 blockchain protocol Fantom’s FTM token has pumped up 8% in the past 24 hours, as per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>In the past 30 days, Fantom has pushed 180% higher. That makes it one of the best performing major cryptos in the world.</p>
<p>Fantom’s upcoming “sonic” upgrade could be behind the recent outperformance.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fantom: sub $0.01 fees today, sub $0.01 fees a year ago, sub $0.01 fees two years ago, sub $0.01 fees since 2019.</p>
<p>Glad to see others catching up, when Sonic launches it increases this distance by 100x again.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s keep pushing the space forward. <a href="https://t.co/WX8fFS9eES">pic.twitter.com/WX8fFS9eES</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Andre Cronje (@AndreCronjeTech) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1768561021357019271?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Last just above $1.10, FTM is still over 70% down from its 2021 highs.</p>
<p>Given that FTM could easily post 3x gains this bull market, it is a good candidate for best crypto to buy today.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Alternatives to Consider</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
All of the above coins offer potential investors a great chance to make 10x gains.</p>
<p>But, for those looking for a better probability of near-term gains, an alternative high-risk, high-reward investment strategy to consider is getting involved in <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/new-cryptocurrency.htm">crypto presales</a>.</p>
<p>This is where investors buy the tokens of upstart crypto projects to help fund their development.</p>
<p>These tokens are nearly always sold cheaply, and there is a long history of presales delivering huge exponential gains to early investors.</p>
<p>Many of these projects have fantastic teams behind them and a great vision to deliver a revolutionary crypto application/platform.</p>
<p>If an investor can identify such projects, the risk/reward of their presale investment is very good.</p>
<p>The team at Cryptonews spends a lot of time combing through presale projects to help investors out.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 14 of what the project deems as the best crypto presales of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Max Howell, the founder of the decentralized technology protocol <strong>tea Protocol</strong>, sat down for a chat with <strong>Cryptonews&#8217;</strong> Matt Zahab, to discuss his highly popular <strong>Homebrew</strong> system, as well as the much-anticipated <strong>tea Protocol</strong>.</p>
<p>He talked about the massive importance of properly compensating developers to create and maintain open-source software so they can work on it full-time, and how tea aims to help that goal.</p>
<p>The famous developer also touched upon commercial open-source, the impossible attempt to merge open-source and capitalism, and what open-source is in its essence.</p>
<p>In this episode, Howell discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>compensating developers to create open-source software;</li>
<li>90% of all publicly traded companies utilizing open-source software across their business units;</li>
<li>relationship between open-source software and capitalism;</li>
<li>the emergence of commercial open-source;</li>
<li>open-source vs. closed-source AI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The First Big Success</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Howell achieved quite a feat early in life.</p>
<p>He told <em>Cryptonews</em> that in the mid-2000s, online music service <strong><a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a></strong> offered him a job.</p>
<p>It was while he was there that he wrote <strong><a href="https://medium.com/teaxyz/tea-brew-478a9e736638">Homebrew</a></strong> in 2009, a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on <strong>macOS</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong>. Tens of millions of developers around the world use it.</p>
<p>At Last.fm, the team was using Mac. But at that time, the state of the developer tooling was lacking.</p>
<p>“I came from a Linux background where I was used to all these awesome package managers that had amazing feature sets and worked really well,” Howell said.</p>
<p>So, after complaining about it at the pub after work, he decided to “do something about it.”</p>
<p>Three months later, he open-sourced his product on <strong>GitHub</strong>. Interestingly, nobody noticed it for a while, so he started “doing some self-evangelism.”</p>
<p>“One day, I woke up and found that I had a bunch of people interacting with my code,” Howell said.</p>
<p>Homebrew has become “a massive success” and quickly. But this created a different career problem. The then 26-year-old Howell thought that everything should move like Homebrew did or he should give it up.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In 2021 I was once again between paid work and wanting to work on Open Source fulltime. I looked at what was there and decided it couldn’t realize my dream. One evening I realized that I could wait forever for some one else to make my dream true—or I could fix it myself. So I…</p>
<p>&mdash; Max Howell (@mxcl) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/1770127864962146636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>When Homebrew became “extremely popular,” the developer was able to leave his job and work on the product full-time.</p>
<p>This eventually led him to create <strong><a href="https://mxcl.dev/">tea Protocol</a></strong>, a decentralized technology protocol that enables open source developers to be rewarded for their software contributions.</p>
<h2>Open-Source Software and Capitalism</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
It’s been 15 years since Howell created Homebrew. For most of his career, he’d take up jobs to earn and save money so he could quit and work on open source.</p>
<p>He stated tgat “there&#8217;s something really wonderful about working on open source. And there&#8217;s nothing else that compares in the corporate world.”</p>
<p>However, the major problem with it is that there&#8217;s no way to work on it full-time in a capitalist society.</p>
<p>And while Howell has no issue with capitalism per se, “it really doesn&#8217;t map onto open source at all.”</p>
<p>There are people doing “commercial open source” nowadays, but it&#8217;s not really open source per some of the usual metrics. The main purpose of open source is to solve a problem that is very specific and often unrelated to revenue models.</p>
<p>Therefore, people have tried to come up with solutions so that some of the open source developers and maintainers can work on it full-time.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Web2 was built on Open Source. I created Homebrew, used by almost every web2 company… yet the most compensation I ever received was a (literal) “thank you for Homebrew” blanket from Google one cold winter.</p>
<p>PromiseKit, another project I created, was once used by over 100,000…</p>
<p>&mdash; Max Howell (@mxcl) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/1749894737862025330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Notably, not many realize how important this is. People need to be paid for maintaining such widely used systems.</p>
<p>“People building in Web2 realized that open source was the way to bootstrap entire businesses,” Max Howell said, adding:</p>
<p>“You could build 95% of your product using freely available open source solutions that are performing and well-maintained and perfectly solved the niche they were trying to solve. Then do 5% of your code as the proprietary bit on the top and make fortunes.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, some 70% of enterprise software is built on top of open source, he said.</p>
<p>And this is not an issue on its own. The open-source tools are there to be used. But the fact remains that somebody still needs to properly maintain the solutions on which 95% of products are based.</p>
<h2>There is Money, But Very Little Goes to Developers</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Open source is everywhere now. It’s “been to Mars, it&#8217;s on the bottom of the ocean, it&#8217;s in every computer, every phone,” Howell said.</p>
<p>There is “a lot of money” in the software and the internet realms, “but very little of it has ended up trickling back to these people that are maintaining these core pieces of infrastructure.”</p>
<p>And you regularly hear about people burning out and rage quitting, he added.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s happened as a result of trying to shove capitalism on to open source is you&#8217;ve ended up with people treating it like a charity, where the only thing they can expect is the goodness of people&#8217;s hearts to throw them five bucks so they can buy a coffee,” said Howell.</p>
<p>Developers earning from donations, <strong>Patreon</strong>, or GitHub sponsors do not receive much either. Upon speaking to many prominent developers, Howell found that the top-earning person makes $24,000 a year. And this man worked on very popular packages.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TEA is stepping up to spotlight these contributors. We’ve noticed a gap—a big one—between the immense value open-source developers bring and the recognition they receive. It’s time for a change!</p>
<p>&mdash; tea Protocol (@teaprotocol) <a href="https://twitter.com/teaprotocol/status/1770081249979146748?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>A couple of years ago, Howell was looking once again for something fresh in the space in terms of working on open source full-time. He wasn’t able to find anything that would ensure that.</p>
<p>“So in a moment of inspiration, I realized that maybe the person who was going to solve the problem had to be me.”</p>
<p>He started exploring technologies he hadn&#8217;t looked at before and realized that there was an opportunity with blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>These could be tools to create something new open source that doesn&#8217;t fit onto a standard capitalist model.</p>
<p>While commercial open source introduces agendas in order to find a revenue model, Howell aimed to build a system that “recognized what is open source, why it works, and then didn&#8217;t change anything about that.”</p>
<p>The only thing the system needed to do is fix the problem of providing sufficient rewards.</p>
<p>Max Howell approached some crypto venture capitalists in 2022 and subsequently raised 17 million for tea Protocol, with <strong><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-investor-binance-splits-from-venture-capital-arm.htm">Binance Labs</a></strong> as the lead investor.</p>
<h2>10.5 Million Projects Over Multiple Decades Ranked</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://tea.xyz/resources/about">Tea Protocol</a> revealed its Incentivized Testnet on February 21. It <a href="https://tea.xyz/learn/roadmap">plans</a> to launch the mainnet on June 12.</p>
<p>Commenting on how and which developers get incentivized on tea, Howell explained that there is a system called Proof of Contribution.</p>
<p>It’s a novel consensus mechanism designed to quantify the impact of all projects across all open-source ecosystems.</p>
<p>An oracle ranks all 10.5 million projects created over the past 20-30 years and assigns them a teaRank between zero and a hundred. “Everything above a teaRank of 25 is going to get automatic rewards if they onboard to our system,” Howell said.</p>
<p>In the three weeks since the testnet launch (between the launch date and the podcast recording), tea saw more than 5,000 open-source projects onboard. And the onboarding process is intentionally made simple.</p>
<p>Max Howell told the viewers that “we&#8217;ve had over half a million people sign up at this point. And as a result, we have over half a million wallets created on the tea Protocol, and so far, 89% of them are active on the protocol as well.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We crossed 400,000 sign-ups to <a href="https://twitter.com/teaprotocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@teaprotocol</a> this morning—we’ve been live less than 3 weeks.</p>
<p>tea Protocol’s mission is to reward Open Source developers for their invaluable contributions to all modern digital infrastructure.</p>
<p>Sign up! <a href="https://t.co/WuFqvGLWO0">https://t.co/WuFqvGLWO0</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Max Howell (@mxcl) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcl/status/1766476348170629553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The goal is to enable developers to work on open source projects more, and if possible even full-time.</p>
<p>When it comes to tokenomics, the gas fees are paid with <strong>TEA</strong> tokens. <strong>Paymasters</strong> facilitates that.</p>
<p>There is also staking, allowing people to “find a project that you think is interesting, […] put some token down, and then earn rewards off of the project.”</p>
<p>Therefore, the project is shifting the view of open source from charity to “an incredibly valuable ecosystem that props up the whole internet.”</p>
<h2>Incentivizing Open Source Security</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Another relevant aspect, the developer said, is that until now the incentives for open source to keep their technologies secure just weren&#8217;t quite there.</p>
<p>What tea is doing is incentivizing whitehats to report any security vulnerabilities they find in a confidential manner via the smart contracts available on the protocols.</p>
<p>If that vulnerability is legitimate, the project must fix it within a certain amount of time. Otherwise, they risk a slashing event where people staking against that project are also slashed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#39;Proof of Contribution&#39; is tea’s secret sauce, accurately rewarding projects based on their impact. Being built on Base ensures a fair, transparent reward system.</p>
<p>&mdash; tea Protocol (@teaprotocol) <a href="https://twitter.com/teaprotocol/status/1764709085641933182?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Notably, many projects are severely underfunded. Often those who need funds the most get the least.</p>
<p>However, tea wanted to introduce an incentive for the open-source maintainers to keep their projects secure.</p>
<p>“I feel that what we&#8217;re building here is for open source and run by the open source community,” Howell said. “So governance-wise, open source maintainers are gonna have the most clout. And longer-term, I&#8217;m hoping that the governance committee of the tea Protocol itself will be entirely staffed by leaders in the open source space. So we&#8217;re going to be courting them actively over the next couple of years,” he concluded.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Only a few weeks into its ICO, 5thScape is already clocking up thousands of followers on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/5thscape"><span>Discord</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://t.me/fifthScape"><span>Telegram</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/5th_scape"><span>X/Twitter</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@5thScape"><span>YouTube</span></a> as more crypto curious get involved.</p>
<p>Clearly there are strong reasons for the buzz, so Cryptonews is here to help readers understand the speculative buzz.</p>
<h2>5thScape&#8217;s Web3 Premise</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In an industry founded on technological innovation, the projects with the most staying power are ones that nurture and pioneer the development of blockchain&#8217;s utility potential.</p>
<p>After all, to drive adoption, which is the endgame for every player in the industry, crypto projects have to interact, integrate and dovetail with other emerging technologies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in the intersection of blockchain, VR and AI that we find the concept of &#8220;Web3&#8221;, a term describing a future decentralized iteration of the internet driven by these technologies.</p>
<p>There in Web3 is 5thScape, the world&#8217;s first crypto, VR, and AI ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Exciting news from 5th Scape! The VR-focused cryptocurrency has raised $1.7 million in its presale phase, and has showcased the potential for innovation in the digital space. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While every crypto project is technically a Web3 project, a few, like 5thScape go a step further into the future: into the metaverse.</p>
<p>Like Web 3, the metaverse is another term for an envisioned internet shakeup.</p>
<p>The metaverse essentially refers to the applications and features of Web 3 that people will interact with in a virtual reality space.</p>
<p>And as a tokenized gaming platform, 5thScape promises to be at the forefront of the metaverse.</p>
<p>Participation is easy, gamers simply buy and hold tokens to get access to the platform, where they will be able to game and stream for free.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the project team took development back to first principles and designed all the software and hardware in-house.</p>
<p><!-- notionvc: 81ec04ce-eab1-4e3c-85cd-3feea01f5585 --></p>
<h2>5thScape&#8217;s 5SCAPE Tokenomics</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
5SCAPE has a market cap on launch of $15 million and is currently priced at <span>$</span><span>0.00215, although this is due to rise 15% to $0.00248 when the third round begins in under two days. </span></p>
<p><span>Eighty percent of the total token supply is up for purchase in the presale. </span></p>
<p><span>When it concludes, 5SCAPE&#8217;s fixed listing price will be $0.01, giving the token a possible prelaunch upside potential of over 365%. </span></p>
<p>5thScape is also fully audited with KYC and the team behind it are <a href="https://docs.5thscape.com/team">transparent</a>.</p>
<p>Those who join the community over on the project&#8217;s socials channels can stay informed of tasks to claim even more 5SCAPE rewards before the protocol launches.</p>
