<p>Nadeem Anjarwalla, a high-ranking executive at cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-future-trade-challenge-tesla-model-y/">Binance</a>, has reportedly escaped from custody in Nigeria. He and his colleague, Tigran Gambaryan, found themselves in legal turmoil, accused of tax evasion among other charges. Despite the expiry of their detention order, Anjarwalla remains unaccounted for. The escape happened from a guest house in Abuja, raising significant questions about security protocols and the effectiveness of law enforcement in the country.</p>



<p>The timing of Anjarwalla&#8217;s disappearance, coinciding with the detention order&#8217;s end, injects further complexity into the situation. This development marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing saga between Binance executives and Nigerian authorities. Anjarwalla and Gambaryan&#8217;s detention highlighted the Nigerian government&#8217;s intensifying scrutiny of cryptocurrency operations within its borders amid allegations of regulatory non-compliance and tax evasion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance under scrutiny after executive&#8217;s escape</strong></h2>



<p>The Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has been at the forefront of the case against Anjarwalla and Gambaryan. The agency alleges that the Binance executives violated tax laws and financial regulations. They remained in detention longer than initially planned, indicating the seriousness of the accusations against them. The legal battle underscores the tension between cryptocurrency entities and regulatory bodies in Nigeria, reflecting a global trend of increased regulatory oversight in the digital currency space.</p>



<p>Authorities are now faced with the challenge of reassessing their strategies following <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/680511-exclusive-detained-binance-executive-escapes-from-custody-in-nigeria.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Anjarwalla&#8217;s escape</a>. This incident not only complicates the legal proceedings but also highlights potential vulnerabilities within the detention and oversight mechanisms. Meanwhile, Binance, a major player in the cryptocurrency market, finds itself under heightened scrutiny. The Nigerian government&#8217;s actions against the platform are part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities purportedly facilitated by cryptocurrency transactions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nigeria increases scrutiny on cryptocurrency platforms</strong></h2>



<p>Anjarwalla&#8217;s escape from lawful custody has ignited a wave of speculation and concern, both locally and internationally. It exemplifies the growing tensions between cryptocurrency platforms and regulatory authorities worldwide. In Nigeria, the crackdown on Binance and similar entities aligns with global efforts to enforce financial transparency and compliance within the burgeoning digital currency industry. These developments come amid broader concerns about money laundering and terrorism financing through cryptocurrency channels.</p>



<p>The case has captivated the attention of the cryptocurrency community and regulatory watchers alike. It serves as a reminder of the evolving challenges and complexities at the intersection of technology, finance, and law enforcement. As the situation unfolds, stakeholders across the spectrum are keenly observing the implications for the future of cryptocurrency regulation and the measures authorities will take to ensure compliance and security in the digital finance landscape.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a much needed resurgence in 2024. Both seasoned veterans and newcomers are seeking opportunities for growth, injecting capital into established players and exploring exciting new ventures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among the hundreds of altcoin options available in the crypto market today, a new presale token, NFTFN, has become the talk of the town.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Armed with strong fundamentals, NFTFN’s popularity is taking on established altcoins. In an interesting turn of events, investors who previously preferred memecoins like Shiba Inu in hopes of significant gains, have now turned their attention to NFTFN.</p>



<p><strong>A Closer Look At NFTFN</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.nftfn.xyz/?utm_source=CryptoPolitian&amp;utm_medium=CryptoPolitian250308" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NFTFN</a>, a pioneer in the web3 fintech space, has emerged as a project to keep a close eye on in 2024. Its ongoing presale has generated significant interest, attracting crypto investors eager to participate at the current price point of $0.025 per token, with supply limited to 1 billion tokens. Analysts are considerably optimistic about NFTFN&#8217;s future, citing the booming NFT market and the potential of its groundbreaking product, SuperNova (SNV).</p>



<p>SNV aims to address key challenges plaguing the NFT market, such as limited liquidity, high entry barriers, and complex risk management. It offers a cost-effective and accessible solution by introducing an NFT floor-price perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX). This innovative derivative product allows users to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Gain exposure to top-tier NFT collections (BAYC, MAYC, Azuki, Doodles, CloneX) without directly owning them.</li>



<li>Diversify their portfolios by hedging bets across various collections, mitigating risk.</li>



<li>Leverage the NFT market with up to 10x amplification on the NFT index, potentially leading to amplified profits.</li>
</ul>

<li>Cloud Partner: Collaboration with Google Cloud Platform ensures scalability and reliable infrastructure support.</li>



<li>Valuation Partner: The partnership with BitsCrunch suggests expertise in NFT valuation, potentially enhancing future NFTFN offerings.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recently, the tech world has been abuzz with discussions surrounding the concept of open-source artificial intelligence (<a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/korean-firms-penalize-ai-crafted-resumes/">AI</a>). With Meta&#8217;s pledge to create open-source artificial general intelligence and Elon Musk&#8217;s legal dispute with OpenAI over its approach to openness, the spotlight on defining &#8220;open-source AI&#8221; has intensified.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Defining open source AI: A conundrum</h2>



<p>Despite the growing interest, a fundamental challenge exists the lack of a clear definition of &#8220;open-source AI.&#8221; While the concept promises inclusivity, transparency, and innovation acceleration, there&#8217;s a lack of consensus on its parameters. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has gathered a diverse group to delineate what constitutes open-source AI.</p>



<p>At the heart of the matter lies the intricate nature of AI models. Unlike traditional software, AI involves multiple components, including trained models, training data, preprocessing code, training algorithms, and model architectures. Determining which elements should be open and accessible poses a significant challenge.</p>



<p>The debate intensifies when considering the role of data. Major AI companies release pre-trained models but withhold the training data, citing competitive advantage and data privacy concerns. This approach raises questions about the authenticity of openness and restricts meaningful modifications and studies.</p>



<p>While some argue that pre-trained models can be adapted without access to original training data, purists contend that genuine openness necessitates transparency in data sources. The disagreement underscores the tension between fostering innovation and safeguarding proprietary interests.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Balancing act: Openness vs. competitive advantage</h2>



<p>For tech giants, embracing open-source principles presents both opportunities and dilemmas. Open-sourcing software fosters ecosystem development, industry standards, and regulatory benefits. However, relinquishing control over valuable training data risks diluting competitive edges and challenging market dominance.</p>



<p>Amidst the debate, voices advocate for compromise. Suggestions include sharing open training resources like data from public repositories like Wikipedia to enable model recreation and understanding. However, legal complexities and property rights concerns surrounding scraped data highlight the need for pragmatic solutions.<br>The tech community defines its parameters as the discourse on open-source AI unfolds. Clarity in defining open-source <a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ai-mobilizes-volunteers-to-save-hedgehogs/">AI</a> is crucial for fostering innovation, ensuring transparency, and addressing concerns about monopolistic control. Achieving consensus amidst divergent interests remains the ultimate challenge in shaping the future of technology.</p>

		<title>UNESCO Report: AI Continues to Amplify Gender Bias</title>

<p>A recent UNESCO report has shed light on the persistent gender bias perpetuated by contemporary Artificial Intelligence (<a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/navigating-generative-ai-guide-for-board/">AI</a>) models. Despite ongoing efforts to mitigate prejudice, the study found that AI systems, including large language models (LLMs), are prone to amplifying societal biases, particularly around gender.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Gender bias in AI models</h2>



<p>The report revealed that popular LLMs often generate sexist and misogynistic content, reflecting societal prejudices. For instance, when prompted with sentences mentioning gender and sexual identity, Meta&#8217;s open-source Llama 2 model produced outputs containing sexist or misogynistic language in 20% of cases. While some AI models, like ChatGPT, exhibited better behavior, biases were still present even after fine-tuning.</p>



<p>UNESCO warned that if left unaddressed, algorithmic bias could become more deeply embedded in critical sectors such as healthcare and finance. Biased AI algorithms could exacerbate existing gender disparities in these fields, hindering efforts to achieve gender equality.</p>



<p>One of the significant concerns highlighted in the report is the impact of biased medical data on AI-powered healthcare systems. Data collection practices have historically favored male subjects, leading to gender gaps in AI training data. This bias has tangible consequences, as demonstrated by a study of AI tools used to screen for liver disease, which missed 44% of cases in women due to biased training data skewed towards men.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Addressing the imbalance</h2>



<p>Sandy Carter, COO of Unstoppable Domains, emphasized the importance of addressing the gender gap in AI training data. She advocated for increased data transparency to highlight gender skews and proposed novel approaches such as crowd-sourcing women&#8217;s health data or generating synthetic data to mitigate discrepancies.</p>



<p>Carter underscored the necessity of fair representation in training data for developing equitable AI systems. By incorporating diverse data sources and embracing transparency in data collection practices, developers can work towards minimizing biases in AI models.</p>



<p>UNESCO report serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenge posed by gender bias in AI. To build <a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/aussies-skeptical-generative-ai-hype-fails/">AI </a>systems that serve all users equitably, concerted efforts are needed to address biases at every stage of development, from data collection to model deployment.</p>



<p>By raising awareness of these issues and advocating for inclusive practices, stakeholders can work towards realizing the potential of AI to advance gender equality in healthcare and beyond. Only through collaborative action and a commitment to fairness can the promise of AI technology be fully realized for all individuals, regardless of gender.</p>

<p>The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) has taken a significant step forward in its endeavor to regulate artificial intelligence (<a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/study-urges-temporary-ban-on-advanced-ai/">AI</a>) usage, especially concerning consumer and worker data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amidst lobbying efforts from both unions and the tech sector, the agency&#8217;s board voted 3-2 to advance rules governing the deployment of AI and the collection of personal information. This development marks a crucial moment in the ongoing debate surrounding privacy, technology, and worker rights in the state.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Union advocacy for worker AI protections</h2>



<p>Labor unions in California are redoubling their efforts to influence the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), seeking to establish robust safeguards around the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in workplaces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This renewed focus marks a significant lobbying initiative as unions confront the formidable influence of the state&#8217;s tech sector. The regulations under consideration by the CPPA are a direct response to the California Consumer Privacy Act, which extends privacy protections to employees alongside consumers.</p>



<p>The proposed regulations drafted by the CPPA encompass a wide array of AI applications in the workplace, spanning decision-making processes related to employment, housing, insurance, healthcare, and education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of particular significance is the provision granting individuals the right to opt out of AI-driven assessments, such as those conducted during job interviews, without fear of facing discrimination. Moreover, businesses would be obligated to disclose their utilization of AI technologies and provide transparency regarding the use of personal data for predictive purposes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Implications of enhanced worker AI rights</h2>



<p>If implemented, these regulations would represent a significant milestone in ensuring worker protection amidst the increasing integration of AI in various aspects of employment. By empowering individuals with the right to opt out of AI-based assessments and requiring businesses to be transparent about their AI usage, these regulations aim to mitigate the potential risks of algorithmic bias and discrimination in the workplace. Additionally, they underscore the evolving landscape of privacy rights in the digital age, where the intersection of technology and labor necessitates proactive regulatory measures to safeguard individual autonomy and well-being.</p>



<p>Under the proposed rules, businesses exceeding $25 million in annual revenue or processing the personal data of over 100,000 Californians would be subject to regulation. Given California&#8217;s status as a hub for AI companies, with a significant proportion of the world&#8217;s leading firms headquartered in the state, these regulations could wield substantial influence.</p>



<p>Despite progress, more than 20 labor unions and digital rights organizations have raised concerns regarding the latest iteration of the rules. They contend that amendments introduced shortly before the vote have watered down crucial provisions, potentially creating loopholes that could undermine accountability in AI usage. Specifically, changes to the definition of automated decision-making technology have drawn scrutiny, with advocates warning of potential exploitation by businesses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ongoing debate and future outlook</h2>



<p>The advancement of AI regulation in California has sparked robust debate, reflecting the complexities surrounding privacy protection, technological advancement, and labor rights. Business interests have weighed in, advocating for exemptions and expressing reservations about the breadth of the proposed regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, proponents argue that comprehensive regulation is essential to safeguard individuals&#8217; privacy and prevent algorithmic bias and discrimination.</p>



<p>As the CPPA progresses in shaping AI regulations, stakeholders from various sectors continue to engage in dialogue and advocacy efforts. The outcome of this regulatory process will have far-reaching implications, not only for California but potentially serving as a model for AI regulation nationwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As discussions evolve and the regulatory landscape takes shape, the balancing act between technological innovation and privacy protection remains at the forefront of policymaking efforts in the Golden State.</p>

<p>Meme coins are renowned in the cryptocurrency market for boosting investor morale, particularly during periods of market turbulence or stagnation. For enthusiasts of meme coins, the newly-introduced &#8220;PEPE&#8221; coin is one not to be overlooked. It has established a remarkable benchmark, experiencing an extraordinary surge of nearly 7,000% since its debut in April 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Memecoins, themed after popular memes, exemplify this trend, with Pepecoin being a prime example. Pepecoin drew inspiration from the &#8220;Pepe the Frog&#8221; meme, originally featured in Matt Furie&#8217;s comic &#8220;Boy’s Club.&#8221; The initial market dynamics of Pepecoin were significantly influenced by frog-themed memes propagated by its creators and supporters on social platforms.</p>



<p>Pepecoin demonstrates how crypto communities can unite around cultural symbols, often overlooking the underlying economic fundamentals of the asset. It follows in the footsteps of dog-themed meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Dogecoin gained prominence with backing from billionaire Elon Musk, achieving a market capitalization of $10 billion. Shiba Inu, meanwhile, boasts a market cap exceeding $5 billion. Pepecoin, by contrast, currently holds a more modest market cap of around $464 million, which is far less than its peak value of $1.5 billion in May 2023.</p>



<p>Following its remarkable bull run, the well-known meme coin Pepe has recently experienced a slowdown. However, even with this downturn, large investors are still actively acquiring PEPE. This raises an important consideration: is investing in Pepe a worthwhile decision? Can it surpass the dominance of leading meme coins, including Shiba Inu and Dogecoin?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Much is Pepe Coin Worth Today?</h3>



<p>The current price of Pepe today stands at $0.0000075, with a 24-hour trading volume of $45.06M. It has a current market cap of $595M and holds a market dominance of 0.04%. The PEPE price has seen a 2.8% increase in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>Pepe Coin achieved its peak on May 5, 2023, reaching the highest price paid of $0.000004408. The record lowest price for Pepe Coin is not specified, but it hit a cycle low at $0.0000006088 following its all-time high. Conversely, the highest price Pepe Coin attained since its last cycle low was $0.051455, marking the cycle high. Talking about how many pepe coins there are, the amount is currently at 417.5 trillion, which is the current circulating supply.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="524" src="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-44-28-1200x524.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-501317" srcset="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-44-28-1200x524.jpg 1200w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-44-28-300x131.jpg 300w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-44-28-768x335.jpg 768w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-44-28-1536x671.jpg 1536w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-44-28.jpg 1814w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>The BoP indicator is trading in a positive region at 0.5, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect from PEPE price analysis next?</h3>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="524" src="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-25-54-1200x524.png" alt="" class="wp-image-501318" srcset="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-25-54-1200x524.png 1200w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-25-54-300x131.png 300w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-25-54-768x335.png 768w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-25-54-1536x671.png 1536w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PEPEUSDT_2024-03-25_13-25-54.png 1814w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p>If bulls fail to initiate a surge, Pepe price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.00000592, which may begin a bearish trend to $0.00000503.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is PEPE A Good Investment?</h2>



<p>Reviewing the Pepe project&#8217;s roadmap, it appears there are no specific future plans detailed, other than an anticipation that $PEPE and similar meme coins will dominate. Given this lack of clear direction, and with an already sizable community of over 500,000 Twitter followers, the project&#8217;s price growth potential may be capped.</p>



<p>However, meme coins have a reputation for offering significant returns, as their values can surge dramatically when supported by strong community movements.</p>



<p>This was evident when Pepe&#8217;s value skyrocketed by over 222% to reach a new all-time high (ATH) following its listing on the Binance exchange. A similar significant announcement in 2024 could potentially propel Pepe to surpass its previous ATH.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recent News&nbsp;</h2>



<p><strong>Pepe Burns $5.5 Million</strong>: In October, Pepe saw a burning of 6.9 trillion tokens. This move, which reduces the total supply, has diminished concerns about the team&#8217;s large token holdings, now worth $3.72 million. Following this, new advisors were brought on to strategize the use of the remaining tokens for partnerships and marketing. This development comes after a recent incident where several developers allegedly made unauthorized transfers of Pepe tokens.</p>



<p><strong>Pepe Rug Pull</strong>: Pepe Coin is embroiled in controversy, with claims of it being a scam emerging on social media. An anonymous developer from the team accused three members of stealing 16 trillion tokens, about 60% of the total supply, from Pepe&#8217;s multi-signature wallet and selling them on exchanges, citing internal strife and greed as the cause of the issue.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pepe Coin: A Quick Overview&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The official Twitter account of PEPE coin brands it as the &#8220;most memeable memecoin ever,&#8221; playfully noting that it&#8217;s time for a change from the dog-themed meme coin era, like the once-famed Dogecoin. PEPE made its debut on April 17 with modest initial attention. It draws its theme from the Pepe the Frog meme, created by Matt Furie in 2005, which has been linked to various trends, including the alt-right movement. Despite its thematic roots, PEPE has no formal affiliation with Furie or the original cartoon character. Additional features that underscore PEPE&#8217;s memecoin status include its total supply of 420 million tokens, a nod to the 4/20 date celebrated in cannabis culture. Analysts call PEPE coin a &#8216;meme takeover.&#8217;</p>



<p>For context, Dogecoin (DOGE) required nearly four years to exceed a market capitalization of $1 billion. In stark contrast, Pepe Coin achieved this milestone within just three weeks of its introduction. Despite the significant price fluctuations of $PEPE since that time, the count of individual investors remains notably high.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The official website of Pepe Coin states that $PEPE holds no inherent value and does not promise any financial return. However, unofficially, it&#8217;s noteworthy that over a hundred thousand investors have acquired $PEPE through Binance and other major cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">PEPE’s Project Changes&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In August 2023, the Pepe Coin community was alarmed by the unexpected transfer of 16 trillion $PEPE tokens (valued at approximately $15 million USD) from the project&#8217;s multi-signature wallet to various centralized exchanges.</p>



<p>This incident, once reported in the media, led to a substantial decline in the meme coin&#8217;s value. Concerns about the future of $PEPE were voiced by community members across <a href="https://twitter.com/asxn_r/status/1694827857694924924/photo/1" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/asxn_r/status/1694827857694924924/photo/1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">social media platforms</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="350" src="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot_4147.png" alt="" class="wp-image-414154" srcset="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot_4147.png 1000w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot_4147-300x105.png 300w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot_4147-768x269.png 768w, https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot_4147-500x175.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>In an attempt to clarify the situation, a representative with access to the project&#8217;s official communication account provided an explanation for these mysterious transfers. This was presumably aimed at reassuring the community. Contrarily, the statement only heightened concerns.</p>



<p>The explanation revealed that disgruntled developers from the Pepe Coin team were behind the <a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pepe-coins-telegram-x-accounts-compromised/">unauthorized access</a> and transfer of tokens from the multi-signature wallet, purportedly under the guise of &#8220;updating&#8221; the wallet. These developers had since parted ways with the project.</p>



<p>The individual managing the project&#8217;s communication account categorically labeled these former developers as culprits, accusing them of theft and subsequent sale of the stolen tokens.</p>



<p>Throughout September, the value of Pepe Coin continued its downward trend despite assurances that the tokens in the multi-signature wallet were secure and being managed by an individual committed to the welfare of the community and the remaining $PEPE tokens.</p>



<p>In October, a significant development was announced via the official Pepe Coin communication account. They introduced a new advisory team to lead the project. The announcement also included the news that 6.9 trillion $PEPE tokens, equivalent to about $6,000,000, had been burned, effectively reducing the total available supply of the project.</p>



<p>This action of burning tokens, combined with the news of the new advisory team, sent a positive message to investors about the ongoing development and management of the project. Consequently, these developments contributed to an increase in the price of $PEPE.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Does Pepe Coin Work?</h2>



<p>The PEPE coin was informally created as a nod to the widely recognized internet meme &#8220;PEPE the Frog,&#8221; which became popular in the early 2000s. It lacks a structured team or a defined development roadmap.</p>



<p>Despite its absence of fundamental backing, PEPE swiftly ascended into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, reaching the 70th position on CoinMarketCap within just two weeks of its inception. PEPE coin commenced trading on April 15, 2023, at approximately $0.000000001 per coin, and at the time of this writing, its value stands at $0.000001116 per coin.</p>



<p>The official website of the PEPE coin candidly states, &#8220;PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.&#8221;</p>



<p>Contrary to this statement, PEPE was designed to leverage the meme coin craze, similar to Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and others. Its primary distinction lies in its thematic inspiration; while Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are dog-themed, PEPE is frog-themed.</p>



<p>PEPE Coin incorporates a deflationary mechanism where a small fraction of tokens is burned with each transaction. This approach aims to create scarcity and potentially<a href="https://x.com/pepecoineth/status/1726428740845228417?s=20" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/pepecoineth/status/1726428740845228417?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> enhance the value</a> of the remaining tokens over time.</p>



<p>Additionally, PEPE uses a redistribution model, where a part of each transaction is allocated among existing token holders. This strategy is intended to foster user engagement and encourage long-term investment in the coin.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pepe Price Forecast: Price History</h2>



<p>The origins of PEPE coin remain shrouded in mystery. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, it didn&#8217;t employ common methods like an initial coin offering (ICO), presale, or airdrop for token distribution. Instead, the coin&#8217;s emergence and popularity are solely attributed to the appeal of the &#8220;PEPE the Frog&#8221; meme among potential investors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/orYSlsY-88lkXAebQjmmo7KQ01li5y0sNU3nVYzlFnjLFqTiX_w0lC4s5DbQFmwyGdEmoHMvR1peO3Cz19YX4G_sr3OXsFGcnLmV7GH166MayOSIEwYF6dXjhcWyD-rTQdpfvH15NuZ6s4ffZjz9ANU" alt="" /></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that there is no known connection between PEPE coin and Matt Furie, the original creator of the &#8220;PEPE the Frog&#8221; meme. The identities of PEPE coin’s creators are still undisclosed, with the only known fact being its launch around mid-April 2023.</p>



<p>Details regarding the team behind PEPE are sparse. However, despite the lack of clear information about its creators, PEPE has garnered significant attention on social media platforms like Twitter and Telegram. This visibility has rapidly cultivated a community around the meme coin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pepe coin quickly gained attention shortly after its discreet launch in mid-April, with its first notable activity on Etherscan recorded on April 18.</p>



<p>The coin&#8217;s value surged dramatically right from the start, jumping from $0.00000006036 to $0.0000004002 within the first three days, a remarkable 563% increase. This rapid growth sparked discussions about Pepe&#8217;s potential as a top meme coin.</p>



<p>Following a brief period of price correction and stabilization, Pepe&#8217;s value began a significant ascent on April 30, soaring 214% in just two days to reach a new all-time high. This surge was attributed by Binance to large-scale buying by major investors.</p>



<p>Pepe&#8217;s momentum continued, with the meme coin achieving a staggering market capitalization of $1.8 billion and an all-time high price of $0.000004354. This peak coincided with Binance&#8217;s announcement on May 5 that it would list Pepe.</p>



<p>However, this upward trend was short-lived, as early investors quickly began taking profits, leading to a downward price trend. After reaching its all-time high, the volatility of Pepe significantly decreased, with both buying and selling pressures appearing to diminish.</p>



<p>The token experienced a significant sell-off on August 24th and 25th, 2023, losing nearly 27% of its value. According to a statement on Pepe’s official communication channel, this drop was due to a malicious team member who misappropriated and sold funds from the Pepe multi-signature wallet.</p>



<p>On October 19th, in tandem with Bitcoin&#8217;s late-2023 rally, Pepe also experienced a resurgence. The coin burned 1.6% of its total supply, totalling 6.9 trillion tokens. This action helped Pepe break out of its long-standing downward trend, climbing 104% in eight days and surpassing the $0.000001 mark again. Since then, the coin has been trading relatively steadily, yet to retest the crucial support level of $0.000001.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">More On Pepe Coin&nbsp;</h2>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Pepe Coin Vs. Pepe 2.0</h4>



<p>Pepecoin (PEPE) witnessed an exceptional surge in the meme cryptocurrency market, recording an increase of over 35,000% within its first three months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The token&#8217;s viability hinged mostly on speculation within social media circles, suggesting that a touch of real-world application might have been beneficial. The launch of a derivative platform, PEPE 2.0, which shared the limelight with the original $PEPE, resulted in a shift in investor interest. While Pepecoin ($PEPE) experienced its first-ever four-day consecutive loss, PEPE 2.0 saw a price increase over the same weekend.</p>



<p>PEPE 2.0 emerged in June as a spin-off from the original Pepecoin (PEPE) platform, about three months after $PEPE&#8217;s debut. It was created by some $PEPE investors aiming to replicate the initial success of $PEPE, but with improvements to address perceived shortcomings of the original token. The launch of PEPE 2.0 attracted significant investor attention, leading to a roughly 1,000% increase in its value within ten days, seemingly at the expense of the original Pepecoin (PEPE).</p>



<p>In contrast to Pepecoin (PEPE), PEPE 2.0 incorporates a 1% transaction tax intended to fund development initiatives for the platform. According to official statements, PEPE 2.0 is designed to incentivize token holders and foster a sustainable ecosystem. The developers have also renounced the smart contract address, demonstrating their commitment to the platform&#8217;s security and integrity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Influences The Price Of Pepe?</h2>



<p>Several key factors contributed to Pepe&#8217;s significant price surge, and they could continue to influence its value in the future. Here are the main ones:</p>



<ol>
<li>Exchange Listings: Pepe&#8217;s value soared following its listing on the Binance exchange. It&#8217;s now traded on various top-tier exchanges. A potential listing on another high-profile exchange like Coinbase could lead to another price hike.</li>



<li>Meme Coin Narratives: Pepe spearheaded the recent meme coin trend. Its rise in value triggered similar increases in other new meme coins. In future phases of meme-coin popularity, Pepe could experience further surges.</li>



<li>Bitcoin Halving Impact: The Bitcoin Halving, a scheduled event every four years that halves the creation of new Bitcoin, often initiates a bull market. The next Halving in April 2024 could positively impact Pepe&#8217;s price both before and after the event.</li>



<li>Future Developments: To reach valuations like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, Pepe needs to offer more utility to its users. Announcements about Pepe&#8217;s future development could greatly affect its market value.</li>
</ol>



<p>On the flip side, if Pepe continues to function solely as a meme coin without added utility, it might struggle to sustain demand, potentially leading to a decline in its price over time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Place To Buy PEPE&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Since its 2023 release, Pepe has been featured on several leading crypto exchanges, with Binance being a notable inclusion. Binance distinguishes itself with its competitive fee structure, diverse features, and a range of payment options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in joining the trend and investing in PEPE coin, here are the steps to purchase it through cryptocurrency exchanges where it&#8217;s available:</p>



<ol>
<li>Account Creation and Verification: Register for an account on the exchange&#8217;s website or app. Complete the identity verification process.</li>



<li>Existing Account Login: If you already have an account on the exchange, simply log in using your existing credentials.</li>



<li>Buying Crypto: Navigate to the “Buy Crypto” section on the exchange&#8217;s website. This will display the available options in your region. At this point, you might consider purchasing a stablecoin first, which can then be traded for PEPE.</li>



<li>Payment Method: Complete the purchase of PEPE using your preferred payment method, such as a bank credit or debit card, bank deposit, or a peer-to-peer (P2P) service.</li>



<li>Storing PEPE: Once you have purchased PEPE, you have the option to store it in your personal cryptocurrency wallet or keep it in your account on the exchange.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is the Pepe Hype Over?</h2>



<p>Pepe, a meme coin with a dedicated community, has seen its hype diminish recently as investors shift their focus to utility tokens. However, market trends are often cyclical, with liquidity fluctuating between different types of investments.</p>



<p>Aware of these trends, the meme coin sector anticipates future developments like exchange listings and ecosystem enhancements, potentially increasing Pepe&#8217;s value and sparking long-term interest.</p>



<p>Remarkably, Pepe soared to a $1.8 billion market cap during its peak but now sits at $477 million despite lacking inherent utility. This speculative nature renders it a high-risk investment.</p>



<p>The rapid growth of Pepe Coin has led to the emergence of numerous variants, attracting investors who are either seeking alternatives or hoping to capitalize on these new coins early, much like they did with Pepe.</p>



<p>Considering these dynamics, it&#8217;s premature to declare the end of Pepe&#8217;s popularity. In the next bull market, Pepe might align with broader market trends and possibly enhance its value through strategic updates.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The frog-themed meme coin PEPE, rapidly gaining popularity in the cryptocurrency market, has been a boon for its early adopters, offering substantial profits. It has even surpassed established meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, attracting a mix of criticism and a strong fanbase. This surge is evident in its increasing holder base, trading volume, and social media footprint, leading to speculation about its future growth.</p>



<p>However, PEPE&#8217;s foundation lacks solidity and intrinsic value, traits typical of meme coins, casting doubt on the longevity of its current success. Its future, like that of other meme coins, remains highly speculative in the volatile crypto market.</p>



<p>Historically, the crypto industry has seen a few &#8220;rags-to-riches&#8221; stories with cultural phenomena like meme coins. Only a couple, namely DOGE and SHIB, have maintained their value in bear markets and performed well as investments. PEpeCoin may be emerging as the third notable example in this trend, but it&#8217;s too early to predict the long-term viability of meme coins.</p>



<p>For meme coins like PepeCoin to be considered a stable asset class, they must endure through various Bitcoin cycles, achieve significant milestones, such as reaching a $1 trillion market cap, and form substantial, culture-driven ecosystems within the crypto world. Until such achievements are realized, meme coins, including PEPE, remain on the speculative fringe of the crypto ecosystem.</p>

<p>In the fast-evolving landscape of technological innovation, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) stands out as a pivotal force reshaping industries worldwide. As companies grapple with decisions regarding GenAI investments, board members find themselves at the forefront of strategic deliberations. Here&#8217;s a concise yet comprehensive guide outlining key considerations for board members navigating GenAI investments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Seizing a competitive advantage with GenAI</h2>



<p>In today&#8217;s cutthroat business environment, gaining a competitive edge is paramount. GenAI offers a gateway to innovation and growth, positioning companies ahead of rivals. Despite initial apprehensions, the burgeoning GenAI market is projected to burgeon into a $1.3 billion industry by 2032, as per Bloomberg forecasts. Embracing GenAI isn&#8217;t just an option but a strategic imperative to stay abreast of industry trends and maintain relevance in dynamic markets.</p>



<p>The integration of GenAI tools across various sectors promises to revolutionize productivity. Businesses anticipate a substantial uptick in overall efficiency, with GenAI poised to streamline tasks ranging from content creation to data analysis. Notably, studies indicate significant productivity spikes, with sectors like customer support witnessing a notable 14% surge. By equipping employees with GenAI-powered solutions, companies can redirect human capital towards high-impact projects, maximizing organizational output.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fostering innovation in GenAI ecosystems</h2>



<p>Innovation lies at the heart of GenAI integration. Companies must proactively cultivate environments conducive to GenAI-driven creativity and ingenuity. Executives recognize the need for robust resources to meet evolving GenAI innovation expectations. Instituting novel workflows and roles geared towards optimizing GenAI utilization is crucial. By championing a culture of experimentation and adaptability, organizations can harness GenAI&#8217;s transformative potential to drive sustainable growth.</p>



<p>As companies contemplate GenAI investments, assessing Return on Investment (ROI) remains paramount. While CFOs prioritize cost reduction, it&#8217;s essential to acknowledge the substantial operational expenses associated with GenAI implementation. Estimates suggest costs exceeding $76 billion by 2028, signaling the magnitude of financial commitments involved. Balancing expenditure with anticipated gains in productivity and efficiency underscores the need for prudent financial planning and strategic foresight.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prioritizing visibility and governance in GenAI adoption</h2>



<p>Maintaining transparency and governance in GenAI utilization emerges as a critical imperative. With the proliferation of Shadow AI – unregulated GenAI usage – companies face heightened risks concerning data security and compliance. Robust monitoring mechanisms are indispensable to track internal GenAI usage effectively. Additionally, investing in employee education and training on GenAI tools is essential to foster responsible usage and mitigate potential risks associated with unauthorized utilization.</p>



<p>The transformative potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is undeniable, presenting both opportunities and challenges for organizations worldwide. As board members navigate the complex terrain of GenAI investments, strategic foresight, and decisive action are paramount. By seizing competitive advantages, boosting productivity, fostering innovation, evaluating ROI diligently, and prioritizing visibility and governance, companies can chart a course toward sustainable growth and success in the era of GenAI.</p>



<p>In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, board members must remain agile and forward-thinking, leveraging GenAI investments to drive organizational excellence and unlock new avenues of value creation. With careful deliberation and strategic acumen, companies can harness the power of GenAI to propel themselves toward a future defined by innovation, efficiency, and competitive advantage.</p>

<p>Michael Dell, the founder and chief executive of Dell Technologies, has initiated a substantial sale of shares within his namesake computer company, marking his first divestiture in nearly three years.</p>



<p>Dell, 59, has been steadily offloading shares since March 6, amounting to more than four million shares with an estimated value of $465 million. Despite these transactions, Dell still retains half ownership of the Texas-based company, a significant portion of his $99.7 billion fortune.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Record high shares</h2>



<p>Dell&#8217;s decision to sell comes as Dell Technologies&#8217; stock continues its upward trajectory, hitting record highs. The surge in stock value follows the company&#8217;s robust financial performance, driven particularly by heightened demand for technology-supporting artificial intelligence applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried, the erstwhile billionaire and founder of the now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange, is embroiled in a legal battle. Convicted of stealing $8 billion from FTX customers, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s successor, John Ray has labeled him &#8220;delusional&#8221; for suggesting customers may recover funds. Bankman-Fried faces sentencing on March 28, with prosecutors seeking a lengthy prison term.</p>



<p>Adam Neumann, the former CEO of WeWork, is making waves in Miami with his real estate start-up, Flow. The company plans to invest $300 million in downtown developments, including rental apartments and retail spaces. Neumann&#8217;s foray into Miami comes amid his exploration of a joint bid for WeWork, the company he previously helmed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Joe Lewis&#8217;s insider trading plea</h2>



<p>British billionaire Joe Lewis, founder of Tavistock Group, has pleaded guilty to insider trading charges. At 87, Lewis&#8217;s legal team argues for probation over prison time, citing his age and cooperation with prosecutors. He awaits sentencing on April 4.</p>



<p>As Michael Dell cashes in on Dell Technologies&#8217; soaring stock, Sam Bankman-Fried faces the repercussions of his involvement in the FTX scandal. Meanwhile, Adam Neumann&#8217;s ambitious Miami venture and Joe Lewis&#8217;s legal battle highlight the diverse trajectories of the world&#8217;s super-wealthy.</p>



<p>With these developments, the ever-evolving landscape of billionaire fortunes continues to captivate observers worldwide.

<p>Amidst the generative AI hype sweeping through boardrooms and digital forums alike, a surprising skepticism lingers among the Australian workforce. Despite bold claims heralding a new era of transformative technologies, many Australians remain unconvinced about the tangible impact of generative AI on their professional lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As businesses grapple with the challenges of digital transformation, a collaborative study by RMIT Online and Deloitte Access Economics has unveiled a concerning trend: a significant gap in understanding and readiness for the adoption of generative AI, raising questions about the nation&#8217;s preparedness for the future world of work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Generative AI hype and it&#8217;s relevance in the workplace</h2>



<p>The growing demand for digital skills, including proficiency in generative AI, underscores the pressing need for workforce upskilling. Deloitte and the Australian Computer Society (ACS) projects a staggering shortage of 1.3 million digital skills by 2030, highlighting the urgency for businesses and individuals to adapt. However, despite acknowledging the impending integration of generative AI into various job roles, a significant portion of employees confess to never having utilized this technology in their current positions. This discrepancy between awareness and application underscores a fundamental challenge in bridging the gap between technological potential and practical implementation within the workforce.</p>



<p>As businesses grapple with the imperative to embrace digital transformation, the reluctance to invest in generative AI training becomes increasingly apparent. Despite its potential to revolutionize learning and development through personalized content creation, many employers have yet to introduce comprehensive training initiatives. This hesitancy reflects a broader skepticism or unawareness surrounding the benefits and practical applications of generative AI, even as industries brace for profound changes driven by technological innovation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Generative AI&#8217;s impact on skill demand and industry transformation</h2>



<p>The economic landscape of Australia stands poised for substantial shifts as generative AI reshapes industries and job roles. With sectors such as financial services, ICT, media, professional services, education, and wholesale trade expected to undergo transformative changes, the demand for digital skills is more pronounced than ever before. While coding has long been hailed as a critical skill, the emergence of no-code generative AI tools is democratizing access to programming capabilities, emphasizing the importance of both technical and soft skills in the modern workforce.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, generative AI is forecasted to create new job roles centered around AI model management and data analytics, necessitating specialized skills and expertise. As businesses race to harness the potential of AI technologies, the challenge lies in closing the gap between skill demand and workforce readiness, ensuring that individuals possess the requisite capabilities to thrive in an increasingly digitized economy.</p>



<p>As Australia navigates the complex terrain of digital transformation, the <a href="https://www.cryptopolitan.com/generative-ai-hype-genuine-game-changer/" data-type="post" data-id="368808">generative AI hype</a> presents both opportunities and challenges for businesses and the workforce alike. The discrepancy between enthusiasm for learning about AI and actual investment in training initiatives raises critical questions about the nation&#8217;s readiness to embrace emerging technologies. In light of these findings, how can Australian businesses and policymakers bridge the gap between generative AI&#8217;s potential and its practical implementation, ensuring that the workforce is equipped with the skills needed to succeed in the digital age?</p>
