										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/grayscale-investments/">Grayscale</a> amended a regulatory filing through which it intends to convert its <span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> Trust </span>to a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/rule-filings/filings/2024/SR-NYSEArca-2023-70_Am._1.pdf">March 15</a> amendment strengthens its earlier filing in multiple ways. The update supports the argument that surveillance sharing within the CME ETH market is sufficient to protect against fraud and manipulation in the spot ETH market.</p>
<p>Grayscale&#8217;s latest amendment includes a correlation analysis conducted by <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> as evidence of sufficient market correlation. Coinbase found that the CME ETH futures market has been &#8220;consistently and highly correlated&#8221; with the spot Ethereum market for roughly the past three years.</p>
<p>The rate is higher than the correlation that the SEC found between the CME Bitcoin futures market and the spot <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> market.</p>
<p>Grayscale&#8217;s amendment also expands on the creation and redemption of ETF shares. Notably, this section describes only cash creations and redemptions. It accordingly states that authorized participants cannot purchase, hold, deliver, or receive ETH.</p>
<p>According to the filing, Grayscale Ethereum Trust now holds $11.8 billion in assets under management (AUM) instead of $4.8 billion of AUM. The conversion of the fund to an ETF would unlock over $1.73 billion of value instead of the $1.6 billion previously estimated.</p>
<h2>Grayscale advocates for ETF</h2>
<p><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Craig Salm</span>, Grayscale&#8217;s <span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Chief Legal Officer, acknowledged the filing and emphasized the expected broad appeal of spot Ethereum ETFs. He <a href="https://twitter.com/craigsalm/status/1768750794021511218">wrote on X</a> that investors </span>&#8220;want and deserve access to Ethereum in the form of a spot Ethereum ETF.&#8221;</p>
<p>Salm added that the case for an Ethereum ETF &#8220;is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Market manipulation and creation/redemption methods were key concerns before spot Bitcoin ETFs gained approval this January. Grayscale&#8217;s latest amendment is vital as it addresses those same issues in the context of Ethereum ETFs.</p>
<p>Grayscale&#8217;s amendment comes alongside declining expectations of regulatory approval. <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/ethereum-etf-approved-by-may-31">Polymarket</a> places the odds of Ethereum ETF approval by the end of May at just 26% as of March 15.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/microstrategy/">MicroStrategy</a> could raise as much as $600 million from its latest convertible debt offering to purchase more <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/jpmorgan/">JPMorgan</a> analysts have <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/microstrategy-bitcoin-acquisition-debt-crypto-rally-price-high-downturn-pullback-2024-3">reportedly</a> cautioned that the firm&#8217;s reliance on debt to purchase Bitcoin could exacerbate a market downturn.</p>
<p>The firm, led by BTC advocate <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/michael-saylor/">Michael Saylor</a>, has <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/mstr-rallies-10-as-microstrategy-buys-155-million-bitcoin-in-10-days/">acquired over 15,000 BTC worth nearly $1 billion</a> since the year began, primarily <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/microstrategy-spends-821-million-to-grow-bitcoin-hoard-to-205000/">financed through a convertible debt offering</a>.</p>
<p>According to the analysts, this funding approach has turned MicroStrategy into a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-long-traders-still-leveraged-at-over-40-billion-notional-value-above-50k/">leveraged player</a> in the Bitcoin arena, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-holders-rejoice-as-value-breaks-unprecedented-71000-milestone-marking-new-ath/">amplifying the ongoing market rally</a>.</p>
<p>They added that such debt-funded Bitcoin acquisitions contribute to market froth and increase the likelihood of more significant deleveraging in future downturns.</p>
<p>Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s recent surge to a record-breaking high of over $73,000, a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoins-sudden-price-correction-wipes-out-over-666-million-from-long-traders-in-24-hours/">sharp downturn</a> has occurred, with prices dipping approximately 4% to around $68,000 as of press time, according to <em>CryptoSlate&#8217;s</em> <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">data</a>.</p>
<h2>Pricing details</h2>
<p>According to a March 15 <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-pricing-of-offering-of-convertible-senior-notes_03-15-2024">statement</a>, MicroStrategy plans to price its latest issuance of senior convertible notes at $525 million, with purchasers also granted an option to acquire up to an additional $78.5 million of the offering.</p>
<p>As such, the anticipated proceeds from this offering range between $515 million and approximately $592.3 million. The notes are slated to mature by March 2031, carrying an annual interest rate of 0.875%, payable semi-annually.</p>
<p>Investors who hold these notes will enjoy certain rights like the ability to request repurchase under certain conditions. Additionally, they will retain the flexibility to convert their notes into either cash or shares of MicroStrategy&#8217;s class A common stock.</p>
<p>The conversion rate for these notes stands at $2,327.31 per share, marking a premium of roughly 40% over MicroStrategy&#8217;s average share price of $1662.20.</p>
<p>The private offering targets qualified institutional buyers and remains subject to prevailing market conditions and other pertinent factors. Its sales would close by March 18.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a face-melting rally in the <a href="/cryptos/ai/">AI crypto sector</a> over the past few months, investors appear to have taken a profit-taking approach over the past few days. The sector <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ai-crypto-sector-nears-10-billion-market-cap-as-bittensor-surges-220-in-2024/">soared past $10 billion</a> in mid-February, buoyed by Bittensor&#8217;s remarkable climb to a $4 billion market cap with an increase of over 220% in 2024. By March, the sector had exploded to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ai-crypto-market-cap-doubles-to-25-billion-in-20-days/">over $25 billion in market cap</a>.</p>

<p>Around March 9, several projects hit new all-time highs, including <a href="/coins/bittensor">Bittensor</a>, <a href="/coins/fetch">Fetch</a>, OriginTrail, <a href="/coins/worldcoin">Worldcoin</a>, and <a href="/coins/arkham">Arkham</a>, pushing the market cap close to $30 billion.</p>
<p>In the past few days, the sector has cooled to below $25 billion in market cap as investors seem to be taking profits after a potentially overheated market surge. While <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-long-traders-still-leveraged-at-over-40-billion-notional-value-above-50k/">Bitcoin has also dipped</a>, as of press time, it sits just 6% below its all-time high, while the top 10 AI crypto projects are mostly down over 20%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_404954" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-404954" style="width: 2140px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-404954 size-full" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-22.58.55.png" alt="Top 10 AI coins" width="2140" height="1244" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-22.58.55.png 2140w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-22.58.55-300x174.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-22.58.55-1024x595.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-22.58.55-768x446.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-22.58.55-1536x893.png 1536w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-15-at-22.58.55-2048x1191.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2140px) 100vw, 2140px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-404954" class="wp-caption-text">Top 10 AI coins</figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, many AI crypto coins have not recently been as closely correlated with Bitcoin as the rest of the market. Bittensor and Fetch, specifically have seemingly been treading their own course, moving down only when Bitcoin has made substantial moves. Even then, the coins often had a delayed reaction or moved against Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Fetch increased 140% in four days since March 6 before slightly retracing approximately 20%. Across the board, since the sector&#8217;s peak on March 9, Fetch is down 4%, ICP is down 11%, The Graph is down 12%, Singularity is down 13%, and Bittensor is down 12.8%.</p>

<p>While the rise of AI in 2023 saw an influx of new AI-related memecoins and hype projects, those currently sitting toward the top of the sector chart are primarily focused on real-life implementation of decentralized AI tooling. The work has attracted the attention of Ethereum&#8217;s Vitalik Buterin, Erik Voorhees, and other notable players in the crypto space.</p>
<p>The importance of decentralized AI models likely aligns with that of decentralized finance as the progress of AI development continues to ramp up. Blockchain and tokenization appear solid bedfellows for a distributed AI network, indicating the recent retracement is possibly profit-taking rather than investors losing faith in the burgeoning sector. However, with such rapid gains, it is also likely that investors will be eager to see progress in delivering technology.</p>
<p>Many of the top progress have live mainnets with projects actively building. The critical next step is to see whether a network effect can bring users on chain to engage with this fascinating cross-section of AI and blockchain. Bittensor, for one, is undoubtedly seeing demand for adoption as the cost to register one of its 32 subnets has risen from around $200,000 to over $5 million this month alone, with the price set by market forces rather than any centralized entity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley said Bitcoin needs to &#8220;change as an asset class&#8221; for the investment firm to consider it as a viable option and has no intention of changing its mind about spot Bitcoin ETFs until that happens.</p>
<p>Buckley made the statement in a preview clip of an upcoming webcast posted on <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/vanguards-perspective-on-bitcoin-etfs#modal-transcript">March 15</a>. The full conversation with CIO Greg Davis will be published on March 19.</p>
<h2>Too volatile</h2>
<p>Buckley said that Vanguard does not intend to change its stance toward the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/products/category/bitcoin-etf/">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, primarily because it does not believe they belong in long-term and retirement portfolios. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Something like bitcoin is just too volatile and it&#8217;s not a store of value — it hasn&#8217;t been&#8230; It is speculative, really tough to think about how it belongs in a long-term portfolio.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Vanguard CEO said that Bitcoin prices recently fell alongside stock prices, and it is difficult to predict the flagship crypto&#8217;s growth. These factors make it difficult to determine how to include Bitcoin ETFs in portfolios.</p>
<p>Buckley said the firm focuses on investing in asset classes with underlying cash flows, such as stocks or bonds, which are easier to value and model.</p>
<p>Buckley <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/vanguard-ceo-to-retire-but-firm-unlikely-to-change-anti-crypto-stance/">plans to retire</a> before the end of 2024 but his departure is unlikely to change Vanguard&#8217;s stance as the beliefs are part of the firm&#8217;s investment philosophy.</p>
<h2>Vanguard&#8217;s past complaints</h2>
<p>Vanguard <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/vanguard-to-ban-all-bitcoin-etfs-on-its-platform/">previously confirmed</a> that it would not offer access to spot Bitcoin ETFs shortly after the funds gained approval in January 2024. The company commented more extensively on its concerns later in the month and said that Bitcoin was an &#8220;immature asset class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vanguard&#8217;s Global Head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker and Index Relations, Janel Jackson, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/vanguard-says-bitcoin-is-immature-asset-class/">notably commented</a> that crypto &#8220;can create havoc within a portfolio&#8221; due to its short history and lack of inherent value and cash flow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the firm&#8217;s Head of Brokerage &amp; Investments, Andrew Kadjeski, explained that the firm aims to serve long-term, buy-and-hold investors.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s history of avoiding short-term market trends, including steering clear of internet funds in the 1990s and removing access to leveraged and inverse funds and ETFs in 2019 and over-the-counter stocks in 2022, illustrates a historic strategy of prioritizing long-term stability over short-term gains.</p>
<p>Vanguard&#8217;s stance has generated significant discussion within the investment community, with some clients expressing frustration over the firm&#8217;s reluctance to include Bitcoin in its investment offerings.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy and potential market pressure, Vanguard remains steadfast in its traditional investment approach, focusing on asset classes it deems fundamental for sustained investment success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/binance/">Binance</a> spun off its $10 billion venture capital arm, Binance Labs, into an independent entity that will no longer be under the group&#8217;s purview weeks ago.</p>
<p>Bloomberg drew attention to the silent change in a <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/top-crypto-exchange-binance-spins-off-10-billion-venture-unit-1.2047231">March 15</a> report, which revealed that Binance Labs had added a disclaimer about the change on its website earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Based on snapshots from Archive.org, the venture firm added the disclaimer in late February:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Binance Labs is an independent venture and not part of the Binance Group nor is it involved in any of the businesses operated by the Binance Group (including but not limited to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The spin-off is one of the most significant decisions made under the exchange&#8217;s new CEO, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/richard-teng/">Richard Teng</a>, since taking over four months ago. He previously headed the exchange&#8217;s Singapore division and has no publicly listed role at Binance Labs.</p>
<p>The companies did not respond to a request for comment as of press time, and the reasons behind the decision to split the venture capital division are unclear.</p>
<h2>Licensing the brand</h2>
<p>Binance Labs Investment Director Alex Odagiu told Bloomberg that the venture capital firm operates independently but will continue to use the Binance brand name under a licensing agreement.</p>
<p>Despite its newfound independence, Binance Labs remains dedicated to its foundational mission of discovering and investing in promising crypto projects. Odagiu reaffirmed the commitment, stressing that the venture&#8217;s focus on supporting innovation within the blockchain ecosystem remains unchanged.</p>
<p>The separation entails distinct contractual agreements for Binance Labs staff, mirroring the organizational structure seen in other Binance-supported entities such as the BNB Chain.</p>
<p>Bloomberg identified the value of Binance Labs as close to $10 billion. The company&#8217;s website indicates that it has supported more than 200 crypto projects over six years. Its portfolio notably includes the top-twenty market cap blockchain Polygon, the metaverse-focused platform <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/the-sandbox/">The Sandbox</a>, and the decentralized finance platform CurveFi.</p>
<h2>Binance reshuffled leadership</h2>
<p>This strategic pivot comes in the wake of Binance&#8217;s recent settlement with US regulatory bodies, culminating in a hefty <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-sentencing-rescheduled-for-april-30/">$4.3 billion fine</a> and the replacement of its founder, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/changpeng-zhao/">Changpeng Zhao</a>, with Teng as CEO.</p>
<p>The reorganization appears to be part of a broader strategy to navigate the post-settlement landscape, ensuring compliance and operational resilience.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Binance co-founder Yi He,  Binance Labs has emerged as a pivotal force in the crypto venture capital arena.</p>
<p>Funded primarily through the exchange&#8217;s profits, it has established itself as a key player, supporting approximately 250 projects, including notable names like <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/sky-mavis/">Sky Mavis</a>, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/aptos/">Aptos Labs</a>, and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/polygon/">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>The venture operates both as an investor and an incubator, with a focus on nurturing startups across various blockchain ecosystems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Federal prosecutors have requested a prison sentence of 40 to 50 years for <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/ftx/">FTX</a> founder <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (SBF) following his <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/sbf-housed-with-ex-honduras-president-in-jail-is-trading-mackerel-and-giving-crypto-tips/">conviction</a> for conducting one of the most significant financial frauds in recent times through the misappropriation of over $8 billion of customer funds.</p>
<p>The US Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York filed a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.410.0_2.pdf">sentencing memorandum</a> detailing SBF&#8217;s wide-ranging fraudulent activities on March 15.</p>
<p>According to the filing, his malpractices not only undermined the integrity of the financial and political systems but also left tens of thousands of victims across several continents grappling with significant losses.</p>
<h2>Greed and ambition</h2>
<p>The government&#8217;s filing paints a picture of SBF as a figure driven by <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/billions-in-user-funds-were-lost-crypto-community-reacts-to-sbf-guilty-verdict/">unparalleled greed and ambition</a>, whose actions reached into the political arena through unlawful contributions and even extended overseas with attempts to bribe Chinese government officials.</p>
<p>Beyond the financial deceit at FTX and Alameda Research, a trading firm he founded, SBF was also involved in banking misconduct, including operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and misleading banks to facilitate his operations.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy, SBF attempted to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/sbfs-defense-claims-ftx-had-no-fiduciary-relationship-with-customers-on-technicality/">deflect blame and evade responsibility</a>, further complicating the legal proceedings and highlighting a persistent refusal to acknowledge the scope of his wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The prosecutors also outlined instances of obstruction of justice, including his use of encrypted messaging to delete evidence and tampering with witnesses.</p>
<h2>Extraordinary punishment for extraordinary crimes</h2>
<p>The request for a 40 to 50-year sentence emphasizes the severity of SBF&#8217;s actions and reflects the prosecution&#8217;s stance on the need for a punishment that matches the extraordinary impact of his crimes.</p>
<p>The memorandum argues that such a sentence is necessary not only to provide justice for the victims but also to serve as a deterrent against similar crimes in the rapidly evolving crypto sector.</p>
<p>In addition to the prison term, the government is seeking forfeiture of assets acquired through the criminal activities and has proposed victim compensation through remission as an alternative to traditional restitution. This approach aims to address the financial harm suffered by the victims, some of whom lost their life savings in the collapse of FTX.</p>
<p>SBF&#8217;s sentencing is set for March 28, marking a pivotal moment in bringing justice to the thousands of FTX customers who were wronged. The case stands as a significant chapter in the legal challenges facing the digital finance world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solana (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">SOL</a>) broke new ground on March 15 after an 11% rally brought its market capitalization to a new all-time high of $82.5 billion at a price of $186.77 per token despite the overall downtrend, which saw the market contract by 4%.</p>
<p>This achievement surpasses its prior peak market cap of approximately $77.9 billion — observed in November 2021 at its all-time high of $259.96 — signaling strong investor confidence and a growing interest in the digital asset.</p>
<p>SOL was trading at $181.35 as of press time — up 9.29% over the past 24 hours, with a market cap hovering just above $80 billion, according to <em>CryptoSlate</em> <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">data</a>.</p>
<h2>Sol ecosystem thriving</h2>
<p>Adding to Solana&#8217;s impressive week, the network saw a record-breaking number of new addresses, with a daily average of 738,040 new addresses based on a seven-day moving average.</p>
<p>This uptick in new addresses highlights the growing community and interest in the Solana ecosystem, which saw a green day of trading, with most tokens recording significant gains.</p>
<p>DEX native tokens — including Raydium and the recently launched Jupiter and Jito —  saw double-digit gains over the past day.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/raydium/">RAY</a> and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/jupiter-ag/">JUP</a> were up more than 30%, while <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/jito/">JITO</a> recorded gains 10%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the largest Solana-based memecoins like <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/dogwifhat/">WIF</a> and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bonk1/">BONK</a> saw a drawdown mimicking the wider market as investors turned to smaller cap tokens on DEXs amid renewed memecoin frenzy.</p>
<h2>Memecoin fever</h2>
<p>The current enthusiasm surrounding Solana is largely fueled by the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/revolut-to-launch-new-crypto-exchange-amidst-reports-of-listing-solanas-bonk-memecoin/">vibrant trading activity</a> related to newly launched <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/meme/">memecoins</a> on the network following a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/pepe-leads-memecoin-rally-with-blistering-118-surge-over-48-hours/">dramatic surge</a> in memecoins this year.</p>
<p>Noteworthy gains were observed in memecoins like Dogwifhat, Popcat, and Bonk, which have posted gains ranging from 117% to 554% over the past 30 days. This surge in memecoin activity has drawn considerable attention to Solana, highlighting its utility and growing relevance in the crypto space.</p>
<p>The appeal of memecoins on the Solana network has been attributed to their accessibility and entertainment value. The trend reflects a broader interest in engaging with the crypto market in a fun and accessible manner.</p>

<p>Other Bitcoin forks, such as Bitcoin Cash, are also down against BTC but at a more modest 3% and 7%, respectively.</p>
<p>Craig Wright&#8217;s Bitcoin fork Bitcoin SV is down around 80% from its all-time high compared to Bitcoin, which is currently rocking around price discovery ranges. While Bitcoin SV is up around 360% from its all-time low set in July 2023 in dollar terms, it is near its all-time low when denominated in BTC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong financial regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), issued a public warning about <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/mexc-global/">MEXC&#8217;s</a> unlicensed operations within its jurisdictions.</p>
<p>SFC <a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/alert-list/3016">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The entity purports to be a virtual asset trading platform operating at the above website. It has been targeting Hong Kong investors but is not licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Consequently, the platform has been added to Hong Kong&#8217;s list of suspicious virtual asset trading platforms, including other notable crypto firms like <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/hong-kong-adds-bybit-to-its-list-of-suspicious-crypto-exchanges/">ByBit</a>.</p>
<h2>Local laws violation</h2>
<p>Per the SFC, MEXC&#8217;s operation in the city-state violated local laws.</p>
<p>According to the SFC:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, it is an offence to carry on a business of providing a virtual asset service (ie, operating a virtual asset exchange) in Hong Kong and/or actively market such services to Hong Kong investors without a licence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not the first time the SFC has issued a public warning related to the MEXC exchange. Earlier in the year, the regulator <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/hong-kong-authorities-issue-public-alert-about-fraudulent-crypto-exchange-masquerading-as-mexc-global/">stated</a> that scammers were pretending to be from the crypto trading platform and luring unsuspecting victims into participating in what appears to be a crypto investment scam.</p>
<p>The scammers used links with addresses that start with &#8220;MEXC&#8221; and end in random letters, similar to phishing links.</p>
<p>As such, the SFC said it may pursue regulatory action against the platform if necessary.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The SFC will not hesitate to take enforcement action against unlicensed activities where appropriate,&#8221; it added.</p></blockquote>
<p class="s3"><span class="s5">Meanwhile, the financial regulator warned crypto investors against trading on unregistered platforms, adding that they risk losing their investment if the platform experiences any form of failure.</span></p>
<p>SFC&#8217;s MEXC warning is unsurprising, considering the financial watchdog recently ended its <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/hong-kong-sets-deadline-for-crypto-exchange-licensing-applications-or-face-shutdown/">registration window</a> for crypto firms to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/htx-reenters-race-for-hong-kong-crypto-license-days-after-withdrawing-initial-bid/">apply</a> for licensing to operate within the Asian city-state. Unregistered entities must close their businesses by the end of May.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>El Salvador received <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> donations after President <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/nayib-bukele/">Nayib Bukele</a> shared the Central American country&#8217;s digital wallet address with the public.</p>
<p>In a March 14 <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1768425845163503738">post</a> on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Bukele revealed that the country transferred &#8220;a big chunk of our Bitcoin to a cold wallet and stored that cold wallet in a physical vault within our national territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>The on-chain address, described by Bukele as the country&#8217;s &#8220;first piggy bank,&#8221; showed that the government holds ‎5,689 BTC, equivalent to $383 million as of press time, according to BitInfoCharts <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/32ixEdVJWo3kmvJGMTZq5jAQVZZeuwnqzo">data</a>.</p>
<h2>El Salvador&#8217;s BTC bag</h2>
<p>This disclosure reveals a substantially larger Bitcoin treasury for El Salvador than previously estimated. Public trackers like <a href="https://nayibtracker.com/">Nayibtracker</a> and <a href="https://bitcointreasuries.net/entities/48">Bitcoin Treasuries</a> had previously placed the nation&#8217;s holdings at 2864 BTC, estimated at $193 million.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the sizable treasury aligns with recent revelations by Bukele, who <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/president-bukele-champions-el-salvadors-multiple-bitcoin-revenue-streams/">highlighted</a> multiple revenue streams beyond mere acquisition. These include BTC earnings from <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/el-salvador-entices-bitcoin-investors-with-citizenship-offer/">citizenship sales</a>, currency exchanges for local businesses, mining activities, and other undisclosed <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/el-salvadors-bitcoin-bonds-set-to-launch-after-gaining-regulatory-nod/">government services.</a></p>
<p>Moreover, President Bukele has consistently reiterated El Salvador&#8217;s commitment to holding onto its Bitcoin reserves, signaling a steadfast dedication to its crypto strategy for the long term.</p>
<h2>Donations and praises</h2>
<p>Following Bukele&#8217;s revelation, crypto enthusiasts praised the country&#8217;s move and swiftly began <a href="https://x.com/mononautical/status/1768449945110233511?s=20">sending</a> small amounts of BTC and rare Ordinals to the wallet.</p>
<p>Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, <a href="https://x.com/paoloardoino/status/1768539020584222814?s=20">said</a> no other country has a bright trajectory like El Salvador while highlighting the country&#8217;s security, growth, economy, and talent.</p>
<p>Femi Longe, a crypto stakeholder from Nigeria, <a href="https://twitter.com/femilonge/status/1768611113451561069">said</a> he looks &#8220;forward to a future where African countries keep a portion of their national reserves in Bitcoin instead of the US Dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This would weaken the hold the guardians of the current global economy &amp; monetary system have on our progress as a continent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, BitInfoCharts <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/32ixEdVJWo3kmvJGMTZq5jAQVZZeuwnqzo">shows</a> that the Central American country&#8217;s BTC wallet received more than $1000 worth of BTC donations in 30 transactions.</p>
<p>In addition, Ordiscan <a href="https://ordiscan.com/address/32ixEdVJWo3kmvJGMTZq5jAQVZZeuwnqzo">reveals</a> that the wallet boasts 67 Ordinal inscriptions, comprising BRC-20 tokens, textual inscriptions, images, and others.</p>
