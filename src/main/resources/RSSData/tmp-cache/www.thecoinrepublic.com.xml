<p><em><strong>Gemini and Genesis were charged with a case by the SEC in the Southern District of New York, and the latest hearing occurred on Wednesday, March 13.</strong></em></p>



<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission said that Gemini and Genesis were engaged in the sale of unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program. A federal judge has approved the allegations, enough to bring a company to the witness box. Both firms were allowed to move forward in the latest hearing, but the two defendants’ motions were denied.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The SEC Lawsuit&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>On March 13, Edgardo Ramos released the New York District Court ruling. It had released a 32-page detailed order that denied the motions by Genesis and Gemini to dismiss or disapprove of the SEC’s lawsuit.</p>



<p>The SEC initiated the lawsuit in January 2023. It claimed that the Gemini Earn program was a cryptocurrency yield-bearing product. Gemini offered the product, and Genesis managed it. Moreover, the product involved the sale and offering of unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Edgardo Ramos emphasized that the program wrongly appeared to meet the criteria of an investment contract according to the Howey test. It determines what constitutes security. The test determines the constituents of security.</p>



<p>Genesis was especially highlighted for not segregating pooled assets on its balance sheet, and it also lent these funds to institutional borrowers at its discretion. This move made customers’ profit expectations dependent on Genesis’ efforts.</p>



<p>Moreover, the court found that it was reasonable to believe that agreements underpinning Gemini&#8217;s Earn program could be classified as notes, a type of debt security that mandates the repayment of loans with interest.</p>



<p><em>“At this stage, under both tests, the court finds that the complaint plausibly alleges that defendants offered and sold unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn program,” </em>stated Judge Ramos.</p>



<p>The ruling does not guarantee a court judgment in favor of the SEC. Still, it will also allow the regulatory body to proceed with its case, requiring the collection of multiple pieces of evidence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Development in the case</strong></h2>



<p>The developments in the case follow a backdrop of challenges for<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/01/13/genesis-global-trading-pays-8m-to-settle-new-york-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Genesis </a>and Gemini, including Genesis’ bankruptcy filing after the SEC’s lawsuit and subsequent agreement to a $21 million settlement with the SEC noted in a bankruptcy court filing the previous month.</p>



<p>In November 2022, 340,000 customers and $900 million in assets under management were boasted because of the controversy surrounding the Gemini Earn program. The controversy intensified after FTX’s bankruptcy, which led to market turmoil.</p>



<p>This change in market forces led Genesis to halt withdrawals from Gemini Earn, citing liquidity issues. To resolve customer grievances, Gemini agreed in February to return $1.1 Billion to Gemini Earn customers via a settlement in the Genesis bankruptcy proceedings, coordinated with New York’s financial regulator.</p>



<p>In May 2023, Gemini and Genisis filed motions to dismiss the case against them. Additionally, subsequent alternative motions to strike the SEC’s request for permanent injunctive relief and disgorgement against both firms. However, both were denied, and it was ruled that the case would be allowed to proceed in the Southern District Court.</p>

<p>Navigating the tumultuous terrain of meme coins, <strong>Dogecoin </strong>(<strong>DOGE</strong>) and <strong>Shiba Inu </strong>(<strong>SHIB</strong>) currently find themselves amidst minor price dips, typical of the volatility inherent in these assets. However, amidst this fluctuation, <strong>Furrever Token </strong>(<strong>FURR</strong>) stands out with its presale achieving remarkable success, signaling a new chapter in the meme coin landscape.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dogecoin (DOGE) Faces Volatility but Looks Somewhat Resilient</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/10/doge-shib-surge-while-furrever-token-furrs-initial-presale-achieves-record-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Dogecoin </strong>(<strong>DOGE</strong>)</a> has encountered a recent downturn, with its current price hovering around $0.1595, reflecting a 3% decline over the past week. This dip is not uncommon for meme coins like DOGE, which are known for their inherent volatility in the market. Despite this setback, many analysts hold optimistic outlooks for DOGE&#8217;s future, particularly as they anticipate a potential resurgence coinciding with the rallying trends of <strong>Bitcoin </strong>(<strong>BTC</strong>) and <strong>Ethereum </strong>(<strong>ETH</strong>).</p>



<p>As meme coins often experience sharp fluctuations in value, the recent decline in DOGE&#8217;s price is not unexpected. Such volatility is inherent to the nature of these assets, characterized by rapid shifts in market sentiment and speculative trading activity. Despite the current downturn, analysts remain hopeful that <strong>DOGE </strong>will regain momentum once <strong>BTC </strong>and <strong>ETH </strong>resume their upward trajectories. This sentiment is rooted in the enduring popularity and strong community support behind DOGE, factors that have historically contributed to its resilience amidst market fluctuations.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, investors and analysts alike are keeping a close eye on DOGE&#8217;s movements, anticipating potential shifts in response to broader market trends. While short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term outlook for DOGE remains positive, driven by factors such as its widespread adoption and community-driven initiatives. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, DOGE&#8217;s ability to weather market volatility and adapt to changing conditions will likely play a crucial role in shaping its future trajectory.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shiba Inu (SHIB) Dipped a Bit but Analysts Are Quite Hopeful</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/11/04/how-to-buy-shiba-inu-shib-coin-on-coinbase-find-the-best-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Shiba Inu </strong>(<strong>SHIB</strong>) </a>is currently trading at $0.00002883, reflecting a 1% decrease in the last 24 hours and a 15% decline over the past week. As with many meme coins, SHIB&#8217;s price volatility is par for the course in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the recent downtrend, SHIB appears to be undergoing a corrective phase, aligning with broader market movements.</p>



<p>The minor dip observed in SHIB&#8217;s price can be attributed to the temporary pause in the rallying trends of <strong>Bitcoin </strong>(<strong>BTC</strong>) and <strong>Ethereum </strong>(<strong>ETH</strong>), which have exerted influence over the broader cryptocurrency market. However, analysts maintain a bullish outlook on SHIB&#8217;s recovery prospects, citing its resilient nature and strong community support as key factors.</p>



<p>While short-term price fluctuations may unsettle some investors, many analysts view them as opportunities to capitalize on buying opportunities. As <strong>SHIB </strong>corrects its price and navigates the current market conditions, investors are encouraged to consider purchasing the dip and exercising patience. With analysts projecting a potential rebound in the near future, SHIB&#8217;s long-term prospects remain promising amidst the broader landscape of meme coins and cryptocurrency assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Furrever Token (FURR) Is Going Strong Despite the Pause on the Bull Rally</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://furrevertoken.com/?ref_url=tcr-dogeshibfurr-16032024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Furrever Token </strong>(<strong>FURR</strong>)</a> is taking the cryptocurrency world by storm with its record-breaking presale success.

<p><em><strong>Paradigm has conducted a survey to know who is the preferred presidential candidate among the crypto community.</strong></em></p>



<p>A crypto investment firm, Paradigm, concluded a poll commissioned among a large share of U.S. voters who hold cryptos and are not very happy with the current financial system.</p>



<p>The survey was conducted between February 28 and March 4 and presented its results on Thursday, March 14.</p>



<p>Donald Trump is the U.S. presidential candidate and is getting favoritism from voters who own cryptocurrencies, as per the data recorded from a poll commissioned by crypto investment firm Paradigm.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Details of the Poll</strong></h2>



<p>Out of the total <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/05/27/crypto-holders-still-in-bear-market-shock-halted-activities-fed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto holders</a>, 48% intend to cast ballots for former President Donald Trump, and 39% posted in favor of current President Joe Biden. Public Opinion Strategies has conducted an online poll, the results of which are shared. </p>



<p>The poll indicated a 3.5% margin of error, and the gap could be reversed as undecided voters can decide on either and reverse the expected trend. The poll gathered the opinions of 1,000 voters. Out of the total, 7% of respondents hold more than $1,000 worth of cryptocurrencies, and 19% have purchased some crypto assets.</p>



<p>The respondents were asked which political party they believed would be able to tackle the issues surrounding crypto. Some of the voters picked neither.</p>



<p>Paradigm’s Justin Slaughter and Dominique Littlle posted a blog entry describing the poll’s results, &#8220;Large numbers of voters are looking for policymakers who can boldly light a path forward on crypto policy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Looking at the development of other products in the industry, more than 10% of the people who have polled said they have either bought a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) (6%) or are going to (6%).</p>



<p>It could further demonstrate that the recent approval of the bitcoin spot ETFs by the Securities and Exchange Commission is not only drawing the eyes of institutional investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The presidential election is just a few months away. However, the primaries have already gathered sufficient support to make Biden and Trump the expected nominees of the two most prominent parties. Other polls on the general election show that both of these prominent candidates are running neck to neck. Trump is enjoying a slight edge over other nominees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is Trump enjoying a higher edge over other candidates?</strong></h2>



<p>Trump is getting favored by crypto investors because of his open acceptance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and also for releasing his own collections. Moreover, he has also addressed the growing popularity of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Trump has been addressing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2019. He has taken a clear stance on cryptocurrencies and the regulations surrounding them on his multiple election commissions at various locations.</p>



<p>Donald Trump is receiving elevated preference amid the surge in value, trading in its all-time high range. His party is also getting popular as the political party with the most support for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, other political parties are getting less trust from crypto investors for their anti-crypto policies.</p>



<p>Trump’s stance against CBDC is also helping it become the favorite choice.</p>

<p>The above data shows that Sandbox crypto gained traction among users in December 2023 and January 2024 and witnessed a massive rise in popularity among social media users. However, SAND crypto seemed to lose its social volume in February, which also impacted the price negatively, and it dropped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, recent data shows a rising curve in the Sandbox crypto social volume in the last week of February and March 2024, which may have a positive impact on the price in the forthcoming sessions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the development activity reflects the activity level in the form of undergoing projects and developments in the Sandbox crypto.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Chain- The Transaction Volume Ratio of Sandbox Crypto in Daily Profit to Loss</strong></h2>



<p>Daily on-chain transaction volume in profit of SAND, loss, and the ratio are metrics that measure the amount and proportion of Sandbox assets that are moved on the blockchain and are either in profit or in loss, contingent on their acquisition cost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss ratio for Sandbox is 0.622&lt;1.</p>



<p>Daily On-chain transaction volume in profit(SAND) is &#8211; 6.58 Million</p>



<p>Daily On-chain transaction volume in loss(SAND) is &#8211; 10.59 Million</p>



<p>These metrics highlight the following aspects of the Sandbox crypto:</p>



<p>Since the volume in loss is high and the ratio is below 1 due to the recent dip observed in the price, it means that most holders might be in a negative position due to the recent dip in price and Sandbox crypto&#8217;s sentiment and behavior may be more likely to hold or buy more.</p>



<p>Similarly, it highlights that related to its supply dynamics and price pressure on SAND, a higher amount of SAND crypto assets are locked or illiquid, generating upward pressure on the price.</p>



<p>In the same way, it also exhibits the trend and momentum of SAND, that the volume in loss is advancing, and the ratio is falling. It illustrates that SAND crypto is facing a correction scenario and is gradually losing momentum as more holders are becoming unprofitable.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Total Supply in Profits and Percent of Supply in Profit of Sandbox Evaluation</strong></h2>



<p>The percentage of Total Supply in profit measures market hype in SAND crypto, which is at 68.511. It measures the percent of total supply in profit earned for a given asset as the ratio between the total supply in profit and the total circulation of the Sandbox asset.</p>



<p>Moreover, the total supply in profit is 2.23 billion, and it shows the overall amount of SAND assets bought at a lower price than the current price of Sandbox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Sandbox Crypto About to Launch Up to $1.0 Mark?</strong></h2>



<p>The<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/12/25/sandbox-price-can-the-sand-price-continue-its-upward-stream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> SAND price</a> structure showed a wonderful rally in its price earlier and made a high of $0.8000. Then, it plunged in recent sessions and showed signs of sustenance by showing the sellers&#8217; rejection at the support level. </p>



<p>However, the Sandbox crypto has revealed a sign of sustenance on a crucial level of around $0.6500 on the chart, and the asset is exhibiting bullish strength and rising capacity from the dynamically active support levels, as it holds above major 20-day and 50-day EMA band&#8217;s.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the SAND crypto asset is showing bullish signs, and it is capable of growing further. It has performed well in the past month and quarter by 42.44% and 31.40%, indicating a solid uptrend.</p>



<p>At press time, the Sandbox crypto is experiencing a decline of 2.80% in the last 24 hours. It is currently trading at $0.6650 and has been showing a dip up to the nearest support level.</p>



<p>Therefore, if the demand rises from this level, the SAND asset price could bounce back, and the next goal for the price is to reach $1.00, and in-between resistance would be at $0.8000.</p>



<p>Another possibility would be that if the SAND crypto price fails to stay above the $0.6500 level, it could decline further.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>SAND saw increased popularity on social media in December 2023 and January 2024 but experienced a decline in February. The recent uptick in social volume in late February and March 2024 could positively influence its price.</p>



<p>Moreover, there&#8217;s a rise in development activities for Sandbox, indicating a growing interest in blockchain solutions, which may also affect SAND.</p>



<p>SAND had a significant rally, reaching a high of $0.8000 before dropping. It&#8217;s showing signs of stability around the $0.6500 support level, with bullish indicators from the 20 and 50-day EMA bands.</p>



<p>Therefore, if demand increases, SAND could aim for a rebound to $1.00, with immediate resistance at $0.8000. Conversely, further declines could occur if it fails to maintain the $0.6500 level.</p>



<p>This analysis suggests that while SAND is facing some challenges, there is potential for recovery if the positive social and development trends continue.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technical Levels</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Support Levels</strong>: $0.6500</p>



<p><strong>Resistance Levels</strong>: $0.8000</p>

<p><strong></strong>The cryptocurrency market is driven in part by popularity. Professionals spot the next big investment opportunity by swiftly analyzing patterns. It explains how the popularity of Bitcoin (BTC) helped make altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX) more widely accepted.</p>



<p>The upcoming sensation has expressed interest in the Raffle Coin presale. Talks of 100x gains have circulated, and this attention alone has attracted holders of Bitcoin, and Avalanche to <a href="https://raffcoin.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raffle Coin (RAFF)</a>. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors Are Even More Sorry About Missing Out on Ethereum (ETH)</strong></h2>



<p>Donald Trump lost out on a lot of possible <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/02/22/bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-and-cardano-ada-price-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum (ETH)</a> income because he sold his shares too soon. Ethereum has increased by 32% over the previous month. Given the current trajectory, Ethereum investors are waiting to see the possibility of $5k.</p>



<p>Analysts predict that Ethereum will soon surpass other milestones because it hasn&#8217;t shown any indications of slowing down. As the second-highest market cap token demonstrates its dominance, fresh Ethereum investors are looking for more opportunities to make purchases.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Avalanche (AVAX) Begins to Pick Pace</strong></h3>



<p>2023 saw relatively little activity from<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/07/30/polkadot-dot-and-avalanche-avax-price-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Avalanche (AVAX)</a>. Even though a lot of cryptocurrencies didn&#8217;t do well in 2023, investors were still interested in them because of their life indicators. On the other hand, despite forecasts of a bull run all year long, Avalanche remained low until late November.</p>



<p>The digital asset is, nevertheless, garnering notice and repairing its reputation. Avalanche has not stopped rising and has increased by 40% in the last 30 days. With further progress, Avalanche has the potential to steal all of the investors departing Ethereum, but before Avalanche needs to start looking for investors, it must hope those investors don&#8217;t find out about Raffle Coin.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Raffle Coin (RAFF) Presents Superior Utilities</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://raffcoin.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raffle Coin (RAFF)</a> offers a genuine opportunity to make enormous gains. People can constantly participate in lotteries with this decentralized platform. To create an account, users do not even require KYC. Members can access lotteries and increase winning chances with a straightforward sign-up procedure.</p>



<p>Users can win a variety of items from Raffle Coin, including clothing, vacations, vehicles, and cryptocurrency. These awards are also easily obtained instantaneously. It gets clearer why Ethereum (ETH) investors are giving Raffle Coin considerable thought.</p>



<p>The traditional lottery system makes the grand claims of being able to transform lives, but the number of winners is never large enough. Because of the daily and weekly opportunities, anyone can now win. A monthly prize is also offered, with 10% of the fees collected from Raffle Coin.</p>



<p>Investors who purchase now will receive more rewards as the Raffle Coin (RAFF) presale proceeds. For a token with the potential to yield 100x gains, $0.016 is just too little. The demand from Avalanche holders indicates how much the public believes in Raffle Coin. Perhaps the next big blue-chip altcoin to completely transform the coin market is Raffle Coin.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Find out more about Raffle Coin (RAFF) from the official website </strong><a href="https://raffcoin.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>.</h4>
