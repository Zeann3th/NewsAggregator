					<description><![CDATA[The price performance of Bitcoin over the past week has been a source of concern for the majority of the crypto community. This has pretty much been the case for other cryptocurrencies in the market, with several large-cap tokens reversing their recently-accrued profits. However, some investors are treating the recent price decline as a rare opportunity in the bull market as they continue to load their bags with assets of their choice. Specifically, the latest on-chain data shows significant buying activity amongst a certain class of investors.  25,000 BTC Flow Into Accumulation Addresses In One Day Prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez revealed, via a post on X, that more than 25,000 BTC (valued at approximately $1.6 billion) was moved to accumulation addresses on Friday, March 22. This figure represents the highest amount transferred to these wallets in a single day so far in 2023. Related Reading: Ethereum Drops Below The 100-Day Moving Average – What’s Next? The metric of interest here is the Inflow to Accumulation Addresses on the Bitcoin blockchain. For context, a Bitcoin accumulation address refers to an address that has zero outgoing transactions and maintains a balance of at least 10 BTC. A chart showing the inflows to Bitcoin accumulation addresses &#124; Source: Ali_charts/X This classification, however, excludes digital wallets linked to centralized exchanges and miners and has less than 2 non-dust incoming transfers. Also, it doesn&#8217;t include addresses that have not seen any activity in more than seven years. The increased flow of coins into this class of wallet addresses is evidence of substantial BTC accumulation by entities who view the crypto as a long-term investment. It signals that certain big-money players are amassing Bitcoin in anticipation of potential value appreciation. What&#8217;s more, this significant acquisition by long-term investors emphasizes the increasing adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value. Meanwhile, it might be an indicator of bullish price movement in the short term.  Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $64,636, reflecting a mere 1% price increase in the past 24 hours. This price change is somewhat negligible, considering the deep retracement of the premier cryptocurrency earlier in the week. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of BTC is down by 2.4% over the past week. Meanwhile, the market leader is currently about 13% from its record high of $73,798.

However, it has been an overall positive performance for the Bitcoin price in March, having surpassed this previous all-time high of $69,000 a little over a week ago.

					<description><![CDATA[XRP, the native token of Ripple, is stirring up excitement in the crypto market with analysts predicting a potential short-term price explosion. However, the extent and timing of this surge remain a point of contention. In a recent analysis of the cryptocurrency market, several market analysts have expressed optimism about the short-term prospects of XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple. These analysts believe that XRP could experience a substantial increase in price, potentially reaching new heights before the peak of the current market cycle. Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Bull Run: Can FTM Hit $2 After 20% Price Spike? XRP Bold Predictions: Fact Or Folly? Capt Toblerone, a prominent crypto analyst, recently ignited the discussion with a bold claim: XRP could see a staggering 15-fold increase (1500%) before the current bull market reaches its peak. This translates to a price target of roughly $10 by July 2024, a significant leap from its current price hovering around $0.62. $XRP chart update. 3 day MACD turning bullish at the right time. 🚀🚀 pic.twitter.com/VgJAjO0Bru — CAPT.

Analyst Jake Gagain believes a $5 price point for XRP is achievable in the near future, while crypto founder Nick envisions a more ambitious target of $10 by the cycle&#8217;s end. This bullish sentiment echoes the broader market expectation of a potential $5-$10 range for the altcoin. Total crypto market cap currently at $2.377 trillion. Chart: TradingView The underlying rationale for this bullishness hinges on XRP&#8217;s historical performance. Back in late 2017, XRP witnessed a meteoric rise, culminating in its all-time high of $3.84.

This more measured approach acknowledges the inherent volatility of the crypto market and avoids relying solely on historical parallels. The divided opinions highlight the importance of caution for investors considering XRP. While a price increase is certainly possible, the predicted 15x surge might be overly ambitious.

					<description><![CDATA[Digital asset analyst with X handle Crypto Patel has recently shared a bullish prediction on MATIC price movement in the coming weeks. This forecast comes amidst MATIC’s poor performance in the last seven days, during which it lost 6.68% of its market value, based on data from CoinMarketCap.  The Polygon native token had been one of the best-performing assets in 2024 rising by over 76.38% between January to March. However, the altcoin has now recorded a 22.83% decline over the last two weeks, drawing much concern over its future price movement.  Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Jumps 180% In 4 Weeks: Just The Beginning? $1.20 Price Level Critical For MATIC Price Surge, Analyst Says In a post on X on March 23, Crypto Patel presented a bullish case for MATIC despite the token’s current downtrend, naming the forecast the “MATIC BULL RUN ROADMAP.” Firstly, the analyst stated that a MATIC bullish pennant was being formed. For context, the bullish pennant represents a price pattern that typically follows a string of upward movement in price (the flagpole) followed by a period of consolidation (pennant). $MATIC BULL RUN ROADMAP 🚀 1⃣ #MATIC Forming Bullish Pennant In HTF 2⃣ 2021 Bull Run: Did 100x in Last bull Market After Bull Flag Breakout 3⃣ If MATIC/USDT Break $1.20 Level in HTF then Ready for $10-$15 Target 4⃣ I am Bullish in #POLYGON for Long Run 5⃣ If Market Crash then… pic.twitter.com/FJEvGiHd4U — Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) March 23, 2024 A bullish pennant is characterized by converging trendlines, which indicates the continuation of the previous uptrend once the price breaks out of consolidation. Importantly, Crypto Patel emphasized that MATIC’s bullish pennant was being formed on a higher time frame (HTF), such as the weekly chart.  Following historical trends, the complete formation of the bullish pennant could result in Polygon native asset experiencing a 100x price increase in the highly anticipated crypto bull run, as observed in 2021. However, with a focus on short-term targets, Crypto Patel has stated that MATIC reaching the $1.20 price zone on the HTF could trigger a surge to a range of $10-$15, representing a potential 1500% gain on the asset’s current price.  Albeit, in the advent of an unexpected crash, the crypto analyst expects MATIC could be significantly affected but should find support around the $0.60-$0.70 price zone.  Related Reading: Buy High, Sell Low: FOMO Made This Crypto Trader Lose 6,039 SOL MATIC Price Overview At the time of writing, MATIC trades around $0.9817 with a 1.30% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume has declined by 31.82% and is valued at $291.65 million. With a market cap value of $9.7 billion, MATIC is ranked the 16th largest cryptocurrency and one of the world’s most prominent digital assets.

<p>However, with a focus on short-term targets, Crypto Patel has stated that MATIC reaching the $1.20 price zone on the HTF could trigger a surge to a range of $10-$15, representing a potential 1500% gain on the asset’s current price.  Albeit, in the advent of an unexpected crash, the crypto analyst expects MATIC could be significantly affected but should find support around the $0.60-$0.70 price zone. </p>

<h2>MATIC Price Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align: left">At the time of writing, MATIC trades around $0.9817 with a 1.30% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume has declined by 31.82% and is valued at $291.65 million. With a market cap value of $9.7 billion, MATIC is ranked the 16th largest cryptocurrency and one of the world’s most prominent digital assets.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum&#8217;s network has seen notable growth recently in both daily active users and daily transaction volume, yet the price of ETH, Ethereum&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, has undergone corrections in the past few days. Notably, Ethereum is down by over 10% in the past seven days, underperforming Bitcoin and the S&#38;P 500. While this decline can be felt through the majority of large cryptocurrencies in the industry, the number of daily active Ethereum addresses has been steadily rising over the past month.  Related Reading: BONK Bonked: Price Crashes 30% In 7 Days – More Pain Ahead? Ethereum&#8217;s Network Activity Surges But Price Remains Stagnant An increase in network activity is usually a bullish sign for the price of cryptocurrencies as more activity means more demand. Interestingly, the number of daily active Ethereum addresses has increased by over 46% since January 3.  This increase in active addresses largely came with a surge in price over the past few months. Ethereum shot up from $2,909 on February 24 to reach a two-year high of over $4,000 on March 12, representing a surge of over 39%. According to data from YCharts, the number of daily active addresses increased simultaneously from 432,647 to 515,145 during the same time frame.  However, Ethereum has been on a price decline since its brief cross over $4,000 and is currently down by 17% in the past 10 days. On the other hand, the network has witnessed a continued surge in activity in terms of on-chain data, with the number of daily active addresses now at 618407 in the past 24 hours, its highest point since October 2023.  According to data from IntoTheBlock, ETH&#8217;s daily average volume has been steadily growing in a similar manner to the one recorded in 2020&#8217;s early bull market. This growth has now pushed the amount of ETH transferred on Ethereum to its highest level since May 2022 this week. Ethereum is now trading at $3,420.

The price of any cryptocurrency, including ETH, depends heavily on market sentiment and speculation. While growing adoption and network activity are positive signs for long-term price growth, speculation is what really drives the price, at least in the short term. At the same time, its price remains under pressure from several areas. One of such pressures is a recent report that the SEC is poking around Ethereum and the Ethereum Foundation and is looking to classify ETH as a security.  As the second-largest cryptocurrency, ETH&#8217;s classification as a security could cause chaos that would eventually cascade into other crypto assets.

					<description><![CDATA[The price of Ethereum has not exactly lived up to its promise as the month has gone on, despite a stellar start to the month. While this bearish pressure has been widespread in the general cryptocurrency market, regulation uncertainty has been an additional concern for ETH, igniting a negative sentiment around the “king of altcoins.” Interestingly, the latest on-chain revelation shows a substantial amount of Ethereum has made its way to exchanges so far in March, suggesting that investors might be losing confidence in the long-term promise of the cryptocurrency. Are Investors Losing Confidence In Ethereum? According to data from CryptoQuant, more than $913 million has been recorded in net ETH transfers to centralized exchanges so far in March. This on-chain information was revealed via a quicktake post on the data analytics platform. This net fund movement represents the largest volume of Ethereum transferred to centralized exchanges in a single month since June 2022. Even though March is still a week from being over, this exchange inflow appears to be a complete deviation from the pattern observed over the past few months. Chart showing total monthly netflow of ETH on centralized exchanges &#124; Sources: CryptoQuant Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Go On Massive Buying Spree, Here’s How Much They’ve Bought As shown in the chart above, October 2023 was the last time cryptocurrency exchanges witnessed a positive net flow. It is worth noting that there was significant movement of Ethereum tokens out of the centralized platforms in subsequent months up until this month. Meanwhile, a separate data point that supports the massive exodus of ETH to centralized exchanges has come to light. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed on X nearly 420,000 Ethereum tokens (equivalent to $1.47 billion) have been transferred to cryptocurrency exchanges in the past three weeks. The flow of large amounts of cryptocurrency to centralized exchanges is often considered a bearish sign, as it can be an indication that investors may be willing to sell their assets. Ultimately, this can put downward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price. Substantial fund movements to trading platforms could also represent a shift in investor sentiment. It could be a sign that investors are losing faith in a particular asset (ETH, in this case). Moreover, the recent regulatory headwind surrounding Ethereum specifically accentuates this hypothesis.  According to the latest report, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a probe to classify the ETH token as a security. ETH Price As of this writing, the Ethereum token is valued at $3,343, reflecting a 4% price decline over the past /4 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is down by 11% in the past week.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market is experiencing a pullback after Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, reached a new all-time high. However, Ethereum (ETH) is not left out in this downward move. After setting a new yearly high of $4,094, the price of Ethereum has been moving downward and this has led to the price trading below the 100-day Moving Average (MA) both in the 1-hour and 4-hour timeframes, but this is not so in the daily timeframe.  Will the price continue downward or will it change direction and start moving upward? At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price was trading around $3,360 and was up by 0.64% in the last 24 hours. Ethereum Indicators And What They Suggest Looking at the chart, technically we can see that a support level of $3,067 and a resistance level of $3,681 and $3,591 have been formed respectively. Nonetheless, there could be more support and resistance created if the price continues to move downward. 4-Hour Moving Average: A technical observation of the chart from the 4-hour timeframe as seen in the image below reveals that the price is trending below the 100-day moving average. This suggests that the price is on a downtrend and could potentially move further downward.  4-Hour RSI indicator: With the help of the Relative Strength Index indicator (RSI) we can see the RSI signal line is trending below the 50 line. This is a strong indication that the price of Ethereum is in a downward trend as observed in the image above. MACD Indicator: Taking a close look at the MACD indicator in the 4-hour timeframe, it appears that the MACD histogram has dropped below the zero line. In addition, both the MACD line and the signal line have crossed below the zero line.  This setup indicates that the price is still bearish and there are possibilities that it could still move downward. The image below provides more details: Possible Outcome If the price of Ethereum continues downward and breaks below the support level of $3,067, it could move further downward to create a new support level. However, if the price fails to break below this support level, we could see a price reversal and may start a fresh trend upward. Thus there could be a possibility that the price could break above the resistance levels of $3,681 and $3,591 respectively, and continue its bullish run.

<h2>Possible Outcome</h2>
<p>If the price of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-signals-uptrend-3580/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Ethereum</a> continues downward and breaks below the support level of $3,067, it could move further downward to create a new support level. However, if the price fails to break below this support level, we could see a price reversal and may start a fresh trend upward. Thus there could be a possibility that the price could break above the resistance levels of $3,681 and $3,591 respectively, and continue its bullish run.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In line with the decline in Bitcoin’s price, the spot Bitcoin ETF market has appeared rather gloomy in recent days. According to data from analytics firm BitMEX Research, these BTC ETFs have recorded a negative netflow for the last four trading sessions.  This situation has been marked by large levels of Grayscale’s GBTC outflows and the record low inflows for the other ETFs, mainly the market leaders BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. However, amidst these persistent declining netflows, Ki Young Ju, a prominent analyst and Chief Executive Officer at Cryptoquant, has predicted a possible resurgence in the spot Bitcoin ETF market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders &#38; Price Top: Glassnode Reveals Pattern Analyst Pinpoints $56,000 Level As Critical To Bitcoin ETF Recovery In a post on X on March 22, Ki Young Ju shared that a rise in spot Bitcoin ETFs netflows could occur even as the BTC price decline continues. Using data from the historical netflow trends, the analyst noted that demand for Bitcoin ETFs usually kicks in when the cryptocurrency traces to certain support levels.  Young Ju stated that, in particular, new BTC whales, especially ETF buyers, have shown to have a $56,000 on-chain cost basis. This suggests that the new significant holders of Bitcoin, particularly those invested in ETFs, usually purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $56,000.  Following this trend, the crypto quant boss believes the spot Bitcoin ETF market could experience massive inflows if BTC reached the specified price level. #Bitcoin spot ETF netflows are slowing.

However, Young Ju believes that such a descent is quite feasible as price corrections usually see a maximum decline of 30%.

Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down 3.53% and valued at $39.62 billion.  Following historical trends of the bull cycle, it is possible that BTC may have reached its price peak leading up to the halving event in April.

					<description><![CDATA[The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has explained that Bitcoin tends to reach a potential top when the long-term holders show this pattern. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Ramping Up Distribution In a new report, Glassnode discussed the influence that the BTC long-term holders have on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply dynamics. The &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days. The LTHs comprise one of the two main divisions of the BTC user base based on holding time, with the other cohort known as the &#8220;short-term holders&#8221; (STHs). Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Surges 15% As Coinbase Plans Futures Listing Historically, the LTHs have proven themselves to be the persistent hands of the market. They don&#8217;t quickly sell their coins regardless of what is happening in the broader sector. The STHs, on the other hand, often react to FUD and FOMO events. As such, it&#8217;s not unusual to see the STHs participating in selling. However, the LTHs showing sustained distribution can be something to note, as selling from these HODLers, who usually sit tight, may have implications for the market. There are many different ways of tracking the behavior of the LTHs, but in the context of the current discussion, Glassnode has used the &#8220;LTH Market Inflation Rate&#8221; metric. As the report explains: It shows the annualized rate of Bitcoin accumulation or distribution by LTHs relative to daily miner issuance. This rate helps identify periods of net accumulation, where LTHs are effectively removing Bitcoin from the market, and periods of net distribution, where LTHs add to the market&#8217;s sell-side pressure. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC LTH Market Inflation Rate over the past several years: The value of the metric seems to have been on the rise in recent days &#124; Source: Glassnode In the chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data for the asset&#8217;s Inflation Rate, which is basically the amount that the miners are introducing into the circulating supply by solving blocks and receiving rewards for them. When the LTH Market Inflation Rate equals 0%, these HODLers are accumulating amounts exactly equal to what the miners are issuing. This implies that the indicator below the 0% mark suggests the LTHs are pulling coins out of the supply, while it being above is a sign that they are either distributing or just not buying enough to absorb what the miners are producing. The graph shows that historically, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has tended to reach a state of equilibrium and potentially even a top when the LTH distribution has peaked. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Capitulate: Here’s What Happened Last 2 Times The LTH Market Inflation Rate has been increasing recently, but it&#8217;s yet to reach any significant levels. As for what this could mean for the market, Glassnode says: Currently, the trend in the LTH market inflation rate indicates we are in an early phase of a distribution cycle, with about 30% completed. This suggests significant activity ahead within the current cycle until we achieve a market equilibrium point from the supply and demand perspective and potential price tops.

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin has seen a steady rise in activity in the past two days to reverse the period of stagnancy recorded earlier in the week. At the time of writing, DOGE is up by 7% in the past 24 hours, reversing some of the corrections it has experienced in the past week. Turns out some Dogecoin whales have been going on a massive buying spree, as indicated by on-chain data.  Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this accumulation trend by tweeting that DOGE whales have bought over 25 million DOGE worth around $3.75 million in the past three days.  Crypto Analyst Reveals Dogecoin Whale Accumulation According to the Santiment chart shared by Ali Martinez on social media, wallets holding between 10 million to 100 million DOGE tokens have now pushed their total balance to 15.63 billion DOGE after adding 25 million DOGE in the past 24 hours.  Related Reading: Don’t Panic: The Bitcoin Bull Market Is Far From Over, Quant Says Interestingly, the chart dynamics indicate this is a major change in sentiment from this cohort of traders, as their collective balance has been in a freefall since March 14th. #Dogecoin whales have bought 25 million $DOGE in the past 72 hours, worth around $3.75 million! pic.twitter.com/y1RnRffWhv — Ali (@ali_charts) March 21, 2024 Why Does This Matter? Crypto whales typically move the market. Increased buying or selloff from a few large traders could change the sentiment of other investors, and they could further cascade a price surge or decline. Notably, the chart shared by Martinez shows that the total balance of DOGE&#8217;s whale addresses has largely corresponded with the price increase.  For example, the drop on March 14 in the total whale balance corresponded with a 33% drop in DOGE&#8217;s price from $0.1878 on March 14 to March 20. However, DOGE is now showing signs of recovery and is currently trading at $0.1629. While Dogecoin whales and FOMO buyers may temporarily push DOGE higher, its long term success really depends on whether it can transform from a memecoin into a widely used cryptocurrency. Dogecoin recently scored a point in its bid to achieve mainstream adoption. Coinbase, America&#8217;s biggest crypto exchange, revealed plans to introduce Dogecoin along with Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash to its regulated futures contract offerings. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals The Possibility Of Bitcoin Reaching $500,000 According to an earlier prediction by Ali Martinez, DOGE could reach the $1 mark in April. His prediction was based off of the crypto&#8217;s performance after similar breakouts in 2017 and 2021.  A large part of this prediction coming to manifestation is a bullish sentiment from whale addresses, especially if they continue on an accumulation pattern. A key price level to watch is $0.20. If DOGE breaks above this resistance level, it could continue surging higher on buying momentum. But if it fails to break $0.20 and starts dropping again, it may indicate the rally is running out of steam.

					<description><![CDATA[The development team behind the dog-themed meme coin Floki Inu has unveiled its highly anticipated roadmap for 2024, revealing several upcoming features and utility-focused initiatives.  Notable highlights include the launch of regulated digital banking accounts, integration with the Venus decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, the Floki debit card&#8217;s introduction, and the Valhalla mainnet&#8217;s upcoming release. Floki Inu Aims To ‘Bank The Unbanked’ Floki Inu plans to introduce regulated digital banking accounts, enabling users to create and fund bank accounts using FLOKI tokens.  Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Jumps 180% In 4 Weeks: Just The Beginning? In partnership with an unnamed licensed fintech company operating in key jurisdictions such as Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE, these accounts will support SWIFT payments and SEPA IBANs.  In addition, the upcoming launch of Floki Debit Cards will allow users to link their digital bank accounts to debit cards, providing a convenient and secure way to spend their FLOKI tokens in traditional currencies such as Euro (EUR) and US dollars (USD).  According to the proposal, the initiative aims to &#8220;bank the unbanked&#8221; by enabling a broader user base to access traditional banking services using their FLOKI tokens while increasing the utility and adoption of cryptocurrency. Pending governance approval, Floki Inu also seeks to list its native token, FLOKI, on the Venus Core Pool. This integration aims to unlock deeper liquidity, comparable to established blue-chip cryptocurrencies and allow FLOKI holders to use their tokens as collateral to borrow various assets such as Maker (DAI), Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin, Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH).  By integrating Venus Markets directly into Floki&#8217;s user interface (UI), the protocol states that users will have frictionless access to the liquidity provided by the platform, further integrating Floki into the decentralized finance ecosystem. FLOKI-Powered Trading Bot And Valhalla Mainnet Launch Floki Inu plans to introduce a cross-chain Telegram and Discord trading bot powered by the FLOKI token. This bot will allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on leading blockchain networks. Specifically, 50% of the fees generated will be used to buy and burn FLOKI tokens, increasing their utility and contributing to a deflationary mechanism.  Finally, the highly anticipated mainnet release of Valhalla, Floki Inu&#8217;s flagship utility and metaverse game, will occur. Valhalla on the Mainnet will feature on-chain game mechanics, a PlayToEarn economy, upgradeable NFTs, and an open-world experience.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETFs See 4 Consecutive Days Of Outflows, Here’s What Happened Last Time As of this writing, the FLOKI token has experienced a correction of over 17% in the past seven days, aligning with the overall market trend. This correction has resulted in the current trading price of $0.0002295 for the FLOKI token. Despite the recent downtrend, it is worth noting that FLOKI has still achieved a remarkable year-to-date gain of 440%. This substantial increase in value has propelled the token&#8217;s market capitalization to $2 billion, solidifying its position at the 59th spot among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the market.
