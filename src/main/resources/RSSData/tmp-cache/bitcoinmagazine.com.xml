If a wallet has a single component that—when lost or stolen—can lead to a permanent loss of funds, then it’s simply too dangerous to consider. Nobody wants to keep significant wealth teetering on the edge of catastrophe.</p><p>Individual bitcoin holders have numerous tools available that can help reduce the risk of loss or theft. <a href="https://unchained.com/features/singlesig-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">In a previous article</a>, we covered some of these tools, highlighting modifications commonly applied to singlesig wallets. However, we also explained why these approaches fall short of removing single points of failure entirely.</p><p>For a business, government, or other institution that wants to secure a bitcoin treasury, eliminating single points of failure is not just a nice-to-have, but a prerequisite. The only custody models worth considering for these entities are ones that include a threshold requirement in order to access funds. A threshold requirement describes a structure that involves multiple, separately secured components, where a subset of those components are needed to approve any withdrawal. This is the only way of achieving institutional-grade security, with single points of failure eliminated completely.</p><p>In this article, we’ll cover how to apply threshold security using three different methods: script multisig, Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS), and multi-party computation (MPC). We’ll also dive into the tradeoffs associated with each approach, and how an institution can choose the best setup to meet their needs.</p><figure>

                    <h2>What is multisig?</h2><p>If you aren’t sure what script multisig is, we recommend checking out our <a href="https://unchained.com/features/what-is-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">earlier article</a> dedicated to explaining how multisig wallets work and what they’re used for. As a quick review, a multisignature wallet involves multiple <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/private_keys">private keys</a>, and can be configured so that a specific number (threshold) of those private keys are required to sign any transaction. The signatures can be produced at different times and locations, allowing each key to remain physically separated. Once a threshold number of signatures have been produced, they can be combined into a single bitcoin transaction capable of spending the funds.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDUwNTgzNjU5MzI1MTgw/image6.png" height="567" width="1200">

                    </figure>
                    <p>This relatively simple way of creating a threshold requirement is highly effective at removing all single points of failure. As long as the spending threshold is greater than one but less than the total number of keys, then any single key can become lost, stolen or destroyed without bitcoin becoming unrecoverable. The remaining keys could sign a recovery transaction moving funds to a fresh multisig setup.</p><p>Satoshi Nakamoto laid the groundwork for multisig when bitcoin was first released, anticipating that it could be a popular mechanism for securing funds. However, it wasn’t until the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-battle-for-p2sh-the-untold-story-of-the-first-bitcoin-war">P2SH softfork in 2012</a> that multisig started to become a widely used tool. Multisig has since proven itself as a battle-tested security model for more than a decade, across several different <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-address-types-compared/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">address types</a>.</p><h2>What is Shamir’s secret sharing?</h2><p>Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) is a secret sharing algorithm that was developed by renowned cryptographer Adi Shamir in 1979. It can be used as another way of introducing a threshold requirement for protecting bitcoin. SSS allows users to split a key into several distributed “shares,” with only a certain threshold of the shares needed to reassemble the key. This can be used to design quorums like 2-of-3 or 3-of-5, similar to multisig. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDUwNTgzMzkxNTQ1MDg0/image2.png" height="570" width="1200">

                    </figure>
                    <p>However, this approach still leads to single points of failure at certain instances during its lifecycle. One example is when the key is initially split up into SSS shares. This operation is usually done on a single device at a single time and place. If an attacker compromises that device, the key generation process or the share creation process, they’ve compromised the key. Another example is whenever the user needs to reassemble the key to sign a transaction. A threshold number of shares must be brought together, once again on a single device at a single time and place, which an attacker could exploit.</p><p>A fairly simple and widely used method of implementing SSS technology for cryptocurrency custody is through the <a href="https://trezor.io/learn/a/what-is-shamir-backup">Shamir backup</a>, developed by Satoshi Labs in 2017. It can be found as an option in certain Trezor hardware wallet models.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <h2>What is MPC?</h2><p>MPC, or multi-party computation, is a subfield of cryptography that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation">traces back to the 1970s</a>. The goal of MPC is to allow multiple participants to jointly perform a computation, while each participant’s contribution to the computation is not revealed to the rest of the group and therefore can remain private. This allows for multiple parties to collaborate in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_problem">various contexts</a> without needing to trust each other.</p><p>When applied to bitcoin custody, MPC involves distributed “shares,” similar to SSS. However, unlike SSS, the shares are not split from a private key nor used to rebuild a private key. Instead, multiple parties compute a single signature directly from a threshold of their shares.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDUwNTgzMzkxMTUxNzQ4/image4.png" height="570" width="1200">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Unlike SSS, MPC does not necessitate a single point of failure. MPC shares can be generated separately from one another, and they never need to be brought together to operate the wallet. Information produced from a share can be communicated to the other participants, without the share itself being revealed.</p><p>Since bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have primarily used a signature system based on ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), MPC had to be adapted for this context. The first practical threshold protocols for ECDSA were published in 2018. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114">GG18</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/987">LNR18</a>]</p><h2>What are the trade-offs between threshold models?</h2><p>With three different threshold security models to choose from, the next step is understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each option.</p><h3>Tradeoffs with multisig</h3><p>Script multisig is a standardized way of achieving threshold security, native to the bitcoin protocol. The structure is considered relatively simple and robust. The barrier to entry is also small—if a bitcoin user knows how to operate a singlesig wallet, then it’s not a large leap to learn how to set up and use a multisig wallet.</p><p>When a multisig wallet is initialized, the addresses produced for receiving bitcoin into the wallet have the threshold requirement built into them. Once a multisig address has been funded, the bitcoin is protected by an immutable contract that has essentially been written into the blockchain itself. The only way to alter the contract (such as changing the access control policy, adjusting which keys are protecting the bitcoin) is to move the bitcoin to a new address that was built with a different contract. For multiple parties who are collaborating to secure bitcoin, this ground-level immutable contract mechanism can provide the highest degree of reassurance that the money is secured according to how all parties have intended. If anything were to be fundamentally changed, it would become obvious to everyone by the occurrence of a public transaction, and the keys that approved the change would be known. This is why collaborative custody providers such as Unchained rely on script multisig for our products.</p><p>However, deploying contracts publicly on the blockchain comes with tradeoffs. As bitcoin is spent out of a multisig address, the access control policy for that address must be permanently published on the blockchain. Observers can then see the details of the multisig quorum that was being used. Although the remaining funds can be easily migrated to a new address going forward, the fact that past security arrangements are exposed isn’t ideal. Additionally, needing to move bitcoin from one address to another in order to adjust the access control policy means that transaction fees are always involved with the process (and the larger the quorum, the more expensive it will be).</p><p>For entities that value custodying altcoins, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, script multisig can pose more of a challenge than the other two methods of threshold security. This is because a multisig threshold quorum is imposed on the blockchain level, and different cryptocurrencies use different blockchains. Many cryptocurrencies don’t even support a native, robust multisig implementation at all. Meanwhile, SSS and MPC enforce threshold quorums at the key level, and look like singlesig transactions publicly. Since almost all cryptocurrencies support a similar standard for singlesig custody (the same key can be used across most cryptocurrencies), this allows SSS and MPC to be more cross-chain compatible.</p><h3>Tradeoffs with Shamir’s secret sharing</h3><p>SSS offers another way of designing a threshold requirement based on relatively simple and battle-tested cryptography. For the purposes of cryptocurrency custody, SSS also has a widely deployed method with a low barrier to entry (<a href="https://trezor.io/learn/a/what-is-shamir-backup">Shamir backup</a>). Once someone has experience using a conventional singlesig wallet, it isn’t a huge leap to use a Trezor to set up a wallet with a Shamir backup.</p><p>Unlike multisig, SSS operates completely outside of public-facing addresses and transactions on the blockchain. Instead, the threshold requirement is decided by how the private key is split into shares. This means that splitting a key into shares and later reassembling them can be done in private, so that only the people participating in the bitcoin custody arrangement are aware that SSS is being used. In addition to privacy advantages, keeping the threshold structure outside of the blockchain also means that SSS transactions won’t lead to increased fees, and it can be used to secure many different cryptocurrencies. Although most cryptocurrencies have their own unique blockchains, they can all share the same private key as an access point, and that key can in turn be split up using SSS.</p><p>The biggest disadvantage to SSS has already been mentioned above—the private key must exist in one place at one time, before it is first split into shares, and also when the shares are recombined for the purposes of approving a withdrawal. These vulnerabilities create temporary single points of failure, meaning that SSS by itself doesn’t offer truly institutional-grade security, unlike multisig or MPC.</p><p>Additionally, SSS doesn’t natively offer a method for adjusting the access control policy. Once a private key is split into a quorum of shares, those shares will always maintain the ability to reproduce that key. If a group is securing a treasury together using SSS and a member of the group leaves, revoking permissions for that individual in a secure manner can pose a challenge. Remaining members of the group could reassemble the key and then split it into new shares, but the old shares would need to be verifiably destroyed. Otherwise, the funds would need to be sent to an entirely new wallet protected by a different key.</p><h3>Tradeoffs with MPC</h3><p>Much like SSS, MPC enforces the threshold requirement at the key-level instead of the blockchain-level. This unlocks similar advantages, such as granting a higher capacity for privacy, avoiding increased transaction fees, and allowing for one MPC custody structure to be used across many different cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Importantly, MPC manages to avoid the temporary single points of failure that come with using SSS. By using a different cryptographic method, the key shares can exist separately from the moment the wallet is first created, and even remain separate while signing withdrawal transactions. Most MPC implementations also include a native method of adjusting the access control policy (creating a new quorum of shares) without having to send funds to a new wallet address.</p><p>However, MPC for threshold ECDSA is considered very complex cryptography, and there is not an agreed-upon standard for using it. There are many different protocols, with the first two being developed independently in 2018 by Gennaro and Goldfeder [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114">GG18</a>] and Lindell et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/987">LNR18</a>]. Since then, we’ve also seen protocols from Doerner et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/523">DKLs19</a>], Castagnos et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/084">CCL+20</a>], Damgård et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/501">DJM+20</a>], Canetti et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/492">CMP20</a>], Gągol et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/498">GKSS20</a>], Gennaro and Goldfeder [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540">GG20</a>], Canetti et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060">CGG+21</a>], Abram et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1587">ANO+21</a>], Doerner et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/765">DKLs23</a>], and perhaps others. While the newer protocols tend to make certain improvements upon the older ones, they may have had less opportunity for peer-review, audit, and other testing.</p><p>The higher level of complexity involved with MPC creates a widened attack surface. With additional components and procedures, there is more room for error and potential security vulnerabilities. Evidence of serious security flaws, including full private key extraction attacks, has already presented itself more than once, affecting some of the threshold ECDSA protocols listed above.</p><p>Examples include:</p><p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1052">AS20 vulnerabilities</a>, September 2020, affecting GG18 implementations</p><p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1621">Alpha-Rays vulnerabilities</a>, December 2021, affecting GG18 and GG20</p><p><a href="https://www.verichains.io/tsshock/">TSSHOCK vulnerabilities</a>, August 2023, affecting GG18, GG20, and CGG+21 </p><p><a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/bitforge-fireblocks-researchers-uncover-vulnerabilities-in-over-15-major-wallet-providers/">BitForge vulnerabilities</a>, August 2023, affecting GG18 and GG20<br><br></p><blockquote><p>“Cryptography needs to pass the test of time to attain longevity, and these new protocols clearly didn’t pass the test of time[…] this research was not ready for implementation or widespread adoption. From my perspective, implementing and productizing such recent research is quite dangerous.” — Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet, December 2021 response to Alpha-Rays</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>‍“[MPC is] more complicated, more to get wrong. Advanced crypto protocols are fragile in the detail and in the implementation. I'd feel more confident in multisig, which is super simple and rock solid.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1612878274446639105">Post</a> by renowned cryptographer Adam Back, January 2023</p></blockquote><p>MPC is also limited by who can realistically use it in the first place. As previously mentioned, threshold ECDSA is very complicated. For the average individual, there are no tools available to safely or easily set up MPC independently. While some businesses offer collaborative custody MPC wallets that are fairly easy to use, those businesses offer no easy way for users to recover funds if the business disappears (or no way at all, in which case they are a single point of failure). Because script multisig is a simple and open standard, businesses who provide <a href="https://unchained.com/features/diy-vs-collaborative-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">collaborative custody solutions</a> using multisig can offer open-source and <a href="https://help.unchained.com/how-to-vault-external-recovery-caravan/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">easy-to-use recovery tools</a>. This creates a straightforward avenue for clients to recover their funds even if the collaborative multisig business were no longer available to assist.</p><h2>Which model is best?</h2><p>As we just covered, there are numerous tradeoffs between using multisig, SSS, and MPC. They can be arranged in a chart for a visual comparison:</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDUwNTgzNjU5MzI1MDYw/image5.png" height="800" width="855">
                        <figcaption><em>This chart demonstrates the strengths (blue) and weaknesses (red) for each method of implementing threshold security. Gray could be a strength or weakness depending on one’s perspective.</em></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>If a business specializes in the custody of many different cryptocurrencies, they might be motivated to hire a team of professionals to carefully set up an MPC custody model. However, if a business or individual were looking for a simple and reliable way to secure bitcoin for the long term, using script multisig and accepting the privacy tradeoffs might be preferable. SSS is rarely used by itself due to its inability to enforce institutional-grade threshold requirements at all times.</p><h3>Combining models for collaborative custody</h3><p>While multisig, SSS, and MPC are often thought of as competing security models, it’s possible to incorporate more than one of them into an overall custody structure. As previously described, SSS and MPC allow a threshold of key shares to produce a signature for a transaction. If the signature was for spending funds out of a singlesig wallet, then nothing else would be required to complete the transaction. However, if instead the signature was for spending funds out of a multisig wallet, additional signatures from other keys could also be needed.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDUwNTgzMzkxNDc5NTQ4/image1.png" height="800" width="1130">
                        <figcaption><em>A 2-of-3 multisig structure, where one possible signature could be produced from a normal key, another possible signature could be produced from a key that is reassembled from 2-of-3 SSS shares, and another possible signature could be produced directly from 2-of-3 MPC shares.</em></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>While this combination of techniques may sound unnecessary and cumbersome, there are indeed some contexts where it makes practical sense. With the rise in popularity of <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-key-agent/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">key agents</a> and <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin-multi-institution-custody/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">multi-institution custody</a>, there is a growing number of specialty businesses that are commissioned by individuals and institutions to secure one of the keys to a multisig wallet. These distributed key agents can help reduce custodial risk. But how should a key agent secure that single key which they are responsible for?</p><p>SSS or MPC can be a strategy to minimize or remove single points of failure from this duty. A corporate key agent can design a system where several different officers within the business each hold key shares, and therefore a signature can only be produced upon agreement from a threshold of those officers. Additionally, if an attack were to occur during an SSS reassembly, or an MPC implementation ends up suffering from a new key extraction vulnerability like the ones listed earlier, then no customer funds are immediately at risk. The key agent would have time to react and address the issue, while the bitcoin remains protected by the broader multisig wallet.</p><p>Using script multisig to create a threshold requirement as a foundational immutable contract, and then commissioning professional key agents to each protect a multisig key using their own SSS or MPC threshold, is far and away the safest method for an institution to keep bitcoin secured for the long-term.</p><h3>New capabilities with Taproot</h3><p><br>In November of 2021, the Taproot soft-fork occurred, adding new tools into the bitcoin ecosystem. Some of these tools impact the future of institutional-grade bitcoin custody, by allowing for certain improvements and optionalities.</p><ul><li><strong>Schnorr signatures: </strong>The Schnorr signature algorithm is now available in bitcoin as an alternative to ECDSA. Using MPC on top of Schnorr leads to threshold security schemes that are far less complicated, and therefore also provide higher confidence in their security, compared to the ECDSA protocols mentioned earlier. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852">FROST</a> is the leading Schnorr threshold signature protocol, while <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki">MuSig2</a> is also available specifically for N-of-N quorums. Both of these signature schemes are on the path to becoming standardized tools across the bitcoin industry, and they are expected to make MPC available for regular individuals, with a user experience similar to script multisig.</li><li><strong>Script type privacy: </strong>Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) addresses are a new <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-address-types-compared/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">address type</a> that allow script multisig bitcoin addresses to appear identical to the addresses being used for singlesig wallets. This provides a significant privacy improvement, because it means that the bitcoin address itself doesn’t provide any clues about its owner’s security model, such as whether or not they might be using script multisig.</li><li><strong>Multiple spending paths:</strong> P2TR addresses also have the ability to contain multiple spending paths built into them. This can create new ways of structuring threshold security for institutional-grade custody, as described in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki">BIP 342</a> (rationale, section 5). For example, a user could create an N-of-N script multisig spending path for every combination of keys that can spend funds. Rather than build a 2-of-3 quorum with keys A, B, and C, a similar outcome can be achieved with three separate 2-of-2 quorums as possible spending paths—one with keys A and B, one with keys A and C, and one with keys B and C. This strategy can increase privacy, because only the spending path that ends up getting used will be revealed. A similar concept can be applied to MPC key share quorums, allowing MuSig2 to be utilized for thresholds.</li></ul><p>These Taproot tools are relatively new, and their adoption is still in the early stages. Many bitcoin softwares and services don’t yet offer full support for what Taproot has to offer. It’s also worth noting that most altcoins don’t have these tools natively available.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>A growing number of institutions are becoming interested in securing a bitcoin treasury, and they require effective solutions. Avoiding single points of failure and minimizing counterparty risk are paramount considerations. The best way to meet these criteria is by leveraging a multisig structure, where keys can be distributed among various enterprise key agents, none of whom will have unilateral control over the bitcoin. Each key agent can use SSS or MPC to add extra threshold protection for their particular key.</p><p>Unchained has pioneered an <a href="https://unchained.com/private-wealth-and-enterprise/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">enterprise custody network</a>, built for institutional clients who want to set up an arrangement like this.

According to critics, these transactions are, at worst, an attack on Bitcoin that tainted the sanctity of scarce blockspace; at best, they are shitcoins, the play-things of gamblers that belong on casino chains like Ethereum.</p><p>Well, miners don’t give a shit if they’re shitcoins. They give a shit about making money, and Ordinals gave them a revenue boost at a time when mining income was at one of its lowest points ever. So many miners have embraced — or at the least, are ambivalent about — Ordinals/inscriptions, since they received a much-needed boost to Bitcoin mining profitability when many miners were nearly breakeven or unprofitable. </p><figure>

                    <p><em>Hashprice is a measure of the USD (or BTC) amount miners can expect to earn from a unit of hashrate (for example, at $80/PH/day, a miner with 1 petahash of mining rigs — roughly 10 new-gen ASICs like the S19j Pro, for example — can earn $80 per day).</em></p><p>Given their positive impact on hashprice, Ordinals, a darkhorse technical advancement that few could have predicted last year, have found themselves at the center of discussions regarding Bitcoin mining economics, discussions that are more germane with each block that pulls us closer to Bitcoin’s fourth block subsidy halving.</p><figure>

                    <p>I’m not writing this to proselytize anyone into becoming an Ordinals enjoooyer. I, for one, don’t really understand the appeal. But I do think that they’re important in the context of Bitcoin’s ever-dwindling block subsidy, so they’re worth studying to understand how they affect blockspace and mining economics — and what developments like them might mean in a future where miners subsist solely on transaction fees. </p><h2>WTF is an Ordinal, Anyway?</h2><p>In NFT parlance, folks use Ordinal and inscription interchangeably, but the individual terms refer to two different aspects of the NFT standard.</p><p>An inscription is a piece of art or digital media, while an Ordinal is technically the number prescribed to an inscription to mark its place in the grand scheme of all other inscriptions. Another way to view it is that the inscription itself is the NFT, while the Ordinal is the number used to identify an individual inscription. </p><p>The data for each inscription lives in the Segregated Witness section of a transaction. As such, unlike other NFT standards, the actual art, digital media, or data is uploaded directly to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Since the inscriptions are fully on-chain, you could argue that they are the purest form of NFT available as they benefit from the blockchain’s immutability. </p><h3>Not All Inscriptions Are Created Equal</h3><p>When you understand that inscriptions are actual on-chain data, you can appreciate some of the critiques and concerns from detractors; if a bunch of NFT degens are inscribing monkey JPEGs and dickbutts and God-knows-what-else on-chain, then this crowds out economic (and potentially necessary) transactions.</p><p>This concern was aggravated by the fact that the arbitrary data for each inscription benefits from a transaction fee discount. As a scalability measure, Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness upgrade modified the transaction structure so that the witness data for a private key signature and public key was moved from the transaction hash field to another part of the block. Bitcoin discounts SegWit data, so it requires fewer satoshis per byte in transaction fees to transact. The arbitrary data for an inscription lives in the SegWit field of a transaction, so it’s entitled to the SegWit discount. Cue the pitchforks. </p><p>This discount is why, despite the first wave of image-based inscriptions clogging block space in February/March/April, transaction fees did not meaningfully increase; block sizes swelled when trendsetting inscribers flushed the blockchain with thousands of JPEGs for the first inscriptions collections, but these all benefited from SegWit’s 4-to-1 data discount versus normal transactions. Perhaps intuitively, it wasn’t until less data-heavy, text-based inscriptions from BRC-20 tokens became the most popular inscription type that transaction fees soared.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDM4OTYzODkzODcyMzgw/image3.png" height="787" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>So-called BRC-20s (a nod to Ethereum’s own ERC-20 token standard) are a loose form of token. I say loose because they are really just Ordinals in a series defined by Bitcoin’s OP_CODE function, where each “token” is itself an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token’s place in the specific BRC-20 series. It goes like this: Someone (God only knows who) publishes an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token series’ max supply, ticker, and the minting limit per transaction. Once publicized, anyone with the technical know-how can mint tokens in the series.</p><p>These OP_CODE transactions do not benefit from SegWit’s data discount, so they cost a pretty penny more than image-based inscriptions. But they also have a feature that image inscriptions don’t: the minting function, which brings Ethereum NFT-esque incentives to collecting these inscriptions. Ethereum NFT series typically have minting contracts where anyone can create new NFTs in the series by interacting with the contract. This is part of — if not the entire — appeal. Minting an NFT is like opening up a digital pack of Pokémon/baseball/Magic: The Gathering cards — maybe there’s a rare card in this next one! </p><p>And while there isn’t necessarily the opportunity to mint a rare BRC-20 (because they are all the same), there’s the chance to mint a bunch of NFTs in a hot new series. Why anyone cares about having ORDI/CUMY/RATS #1 or #100 or whatever, I don’t know. Perhaps it’s the greatest expression of the greater fool theory yet in Bitcoin. But the fact is, they do, and the minting incentives for BRC-20s precipitated the largest wave of Bitcoin transaction activity ever.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDM4OTYzODkzODA2ODQ0/image2.png" height="787" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Through a combination of fee wars and the fact that these NFTs don’t benefit from the SegWit discount, BRC-20s have catered a veritable fee feast for Bitcoin miners, but not exactly in the way you might think.</p><h2>Quantifying Transaction Fee Collateral Damage </h2><p>The bulk of transaction fee increases in 2023 has not come directly from fees associated with Ordinals; it has come from indirect fee pressure on other transactions. </p><p>Per data from independent analyst Data Always’ Dune dashboard, as of November 12, 2023, miners have raked in $70.3 million fees from Ordinals. Seems bigly, but it’s only 19.4% of the $368.2 million in transaction fees that miners have earned in total since inscriptions debuted on December 14, 2022. To put this into further perspective, there have been 40.2 million inscription transactions, which equates to 30% of all transaction volume since December 14. So inscriptions have accounted for one-third of transaction volume over the last year but only one-fifth of all fees. </p><figure>
                        
                        <a href="https://inscriptionissue.bitcoinmagazine.com/how-miners-learned" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDM5MDUxOTQwNjM2NDEy/harper3.jpg" height="791" width="1200"></a>
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>As for the other fees, many of them are the result of indirect fee pressure from inscriptions — that is, fees that do not come directly from inscriptions themselves, but from the pressure that inscriptions exert on the average transaction fee needed to clear a Bitcoin transaction in a reasonable time frame. </p><p>Galaxy Digital Research examines this dynamic in a report titled “Bitcoin Inscriptions & Ordinals: A Maturing Ecosystem”. Rampant inscription activity congests the mempool. This is particularly true during BRC-20 minting events, as the first-come-first-mint incentivizes bidding wars as inscribers gun to be the first to mint a series. This raises the floor for average transaction fees and, as Galaxy Digital Research points out, precipitates transaction fee “overpayment” from various transactors. They define overpayment as any fee in a block that is greater than that block’s median transaction fee. For normal transactions, this overpayment could come from transaction fee estimators in wallets or on exchanges or from general user ignorance regarding transaction fee structure and dynamics. Some users may also need to expedite transactions for any number of reasons, leading to overpayment. For inscription transactions, Galaxy Digital Research says that “voluntary overpayment” was commonplace during times of high activity and popular inscription mints.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDM4OTYzODkzNzQxMzA4/image1.png" height="787" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>This chart quantifies overpayment for inscription transactions and all other transactions to demonstrate the dynamics Galaxy Digital Research outlines in their report. When Bitcoin’s mempool became backlogged in April and May — the hottest time frame for inscription activity so far — a majority of the transaction fees during this time actually came from user overpayment for financial transactions, not inscriptions themselves. These users could probably make it easier on themselves by not using built-in transaction fee estimators with their wallets and exchanges.</p><h2>Blessing and a Curse</h2><p>Inscriptions are a blessing and a curse. They’re a godsend for miners, but they can be a pain in the ass for other Bitcoiners, particularly those who have to send transactions on the network every day. </p><p>That said, blockspace is an open market. So I don’t have to like Ordinals to recognize that it’s not my place to police someone else’s spending. Nor is it my place to censor a transaction that pays for blockspace on the f(r)ee market. That’s part of the point of a permissionless blockchain, after all: to make transactions other people don’t want you to make.</p><p><strong><em>This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s</em> <em>“The Inscription Issue”.

Even if the probability is low, the reward is worth the risk. </p><p>Pascal’s wager as a justification for bitcoin? Yes, I’m aware of the fallacies: false dichotomy, appeal to emotion, begging the question, etc. That is not the point.

The translated points would go something like this:</p><ul><li>If you own bitcoin early and it becomes a globally valuable money, you gain immensely. 😀</li><li>If you own bitcoin and it fails, you’ve lost that value. 😢</li><li>If you don’t own bitcoin and it goes to zero, no pain and no gain. 😐 </li><li>If you don’t own bitcoin and it succeeds, you will have missed out on the significant financial revolution of our lifetimes and fall comparatively behind. 😡</li></ul><p>If bitcoin is successful, it will be worth far more than it is today and have a massive impact on your financial future. If it fails, the losses are only limited to your exposure. The most that you could lose is the money that you invested. </p><p>It is hypothetically possible that bitcoin could be worth 100x more than it is today, but it can only possibly lose 1x its value as it goes to zero. The concept we’re discussing here is <strong>asymmetric upside</strong> - significant gains with relatively limited downside. In other words, the potential rewards of the investment outweigh the potential risks. </p><p>Bitcoin offers an asymmetric upside that makes it a wise investment for most portfolios. Even a small allocation provides potential protection against extreme currency debasement.</p><h2>Salt, gasoline, and insurance</h2><figure>

                    <p><em>“Don’t over salt your steak, pour too much gas on the fire, or buy too much insurance.” </em></p><p>A little bit goes a long way, and you can easily overdo it. The same applies when looking at bitcoin in the context of a financial plan.</p><p>Bitcoin’s asymmetric upside gives it “insurance-like” qualities, and that insurance pays off very well in times of money printing. This was exemplified in 2020 when bitcoin's value increased over 300% in response to pandemic money printing, far outpacing stocks, gold, and bonds. </p><p>Bitcoin offers a similar asymmetric upside today. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it resistant to inflationary debasement. In contrast, the dollar's purchasing power consistently declines through unrestrained money printing. History has shown that societies prefer money that is hard to inflate. </p><p>If recent rampant inflation is uncontainable and the dollar system falters, bitcoin is well-positioned as a successor. This global monetary A/B test is still early, but given their respective sizes, a little bitcoin can go a long way. If it succeeds, early adopters will benefit enormously compared to latecomers. Of course, there are no guarantees, but the potential reward justifies reasonable exposure despite the risks. </p><p>Let’s imagine Nervous Nancy, an extremely conservative investor. She wants to invest but also take the least risk possible. She invests 100% of her money in short-term cash equivalents (short-term treasuries, money markets, CDs, maybe some cash in the coffee can). With this investment allocation, she’s nearly certain to get her initial investment back and receive a modest amount of interest as a gain. However, she has no guarantees that the investment returned to her will purchase the same amount as it used to. Inflation and money printing cause each dollar to be able to purchase less and less over time. Depending on the severity of the inflation, it might not buy anything at all. In other words, she didn’t lose any dollars, but the dollar lost purchasing power. </p><p>Now, let’s salt her portfolio with bitcoin.</p><p>99% short-term treasuries. 1% bitcoin.</p><p>With a 1% allocation, if bitcoin goes to zero overnight, she’ll have only lost a penny on the dollar, and her treasury interest will quickly fill the gap. Not at all catastrophic to her financial future. </p><p>However, if the hypothetical hyperinflationary scenario from above plays out and bitcoin grows 100x in purchasing power, she’s saved everything. Metaphorically, her entire dollar house burned down, and “bitcoin insurance” made her whole. Powerful. A little bitcoin salt goes a long way. </p><p>(When protecting against the existing system, it’s important to remember that you need to get your bitcoin out of the system. Keeping bitcoin on an exchange or with a counterparty will do you no good if that entity fails. If you view bitcoin as insurance, it’s essential to keep your bitcoin in <a href="https://unchained.com/vaults/">cold storage and hold your keys</a>. Otherwise, it’s someone else’s insurance.)</p><h2>When all you have a hammer, everything looks like a…</h2><figure>

                    <p>A construction joke:</p><p><em>There are only three rules to construction: 1.) Always use the right tool for the job! 2.) A hammer is always the right tool! 3.) Anything can be a hammer! </em></p><p>Yeah. That’s what I thought, too. Slightly funny and mostly useless. </p><p>But if you spend enough time swinging a hammer, you’ll eventually realize it can be more than it first appears. Not everything is a nail. A hammer can tear down walls, break concrete, tap objects into place, and wiggle other things out. A hammer can create and destroy; it builds tall towers and humbles novice fingers. The use cases expand with the skill of the carpenter. </p><p>Like hammers, bitcoin is a monetary tool. And a 1-5% allocator to the asset typically sees a “speculative insurance” use case - valid. Bitcoin is speculative insurance, but it is not only speculative insurance. People invest and save in bitcoin for many different reasons. </p><p>I’ve seen people use bitcoin to pursue all of the following use cases: </p><ul><li>Hedging against a financial collapse (speculative insurance)</li><li>Saving for family and future (long-term general savings and safety net)</li><li>Growing a downpayment for a house (medium-term specific savings)</li><li>Shooting for the moon in a manner equivalent to winning the lottery (gambling)</li><li>Opting out of government-run, bank-controlled financial systems (financial optionality)</li><li>Making a quick buck (short-term trading)</li><li>Escaping a hostile country (wealth evacuation)</li><li>Locking away wealth that can’t be confiscated (wealth preservation)</li><li>As a means to influence opinions and gain followers (social status)</li><li>Fix the money and fix the world (mission and purpose)</li></ul><p>Keep this in mind when taking other people’s financial advice. They are often playing a different game than you. They have different goals, upbringings, worldviews, family dynamics, and circumstances. Even though they might use the same hammer as you, it could be for a completely different job. </p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>A massive allocation to bitcoin may seem crazy to some people, yet perfectly reasonable to others. The same goes for having a 1% allocation. </p><p>But, given today’s macroeconomic environment and bitcoin’s trajectory, I find very few use cases where 0% bitcoin makes sense. By not owning bitcoin, you implicitly say that you are 100% certain it will fail and go to zero. Given its 14-year history so far, I’d recommend reducing your confidence. Nobody is 100% right forever. A little salt goes a long way. Your financial plan may be riskier without bitcoin. Diversify accordingly. </p><p><em>“We must learn our limits.

By receiving an official blessing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an institutional investing barrier has been lifted.</p><p>With this barrier gone, financial advisors, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies and retail investors can now receive Bitcoin exposure without hassling with direct custodianship. More importantly, a taint has been scrubbed off from Bitcoin, previously likened to “tulip mania”, “rat poison”, or “index of money laundering”.</p><p>Following the unprecedented domino of crypto bankruptcies throughout 2022, Bitcoin price reverted to November 2020 level of $15.7k by the end of that year. After that great FUD reservoir was drained, Bitcoin slowly recovered during 2023 and entered 2024 at $45k level, first visited in February 2021.</p><p>With the 4th Bitcoin halving ahead in April, and with ETFs setting new market dynamics, what should Bitcoin investors expect next? To determine that, one must understand how Bitcoin ETFs elevated BTC trading volume, effectively stabilizing Bitcoin’s price volatility.</p><h2>Understanding Bitcoin ETFs and Market Dynamics</h2><p>Bitcoin itself represents the democratization of money. Not beholden to central authority like the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin’s decentralized network of miners and algorithmically determined monetary policy ensures that its limited 21 million coin supply can’t be tampered with. </p><p>For BTC investors, this means they can be exposed to an asset that is not on an inherent trajectory of devaluation, which is in stark contrast to all existing fiat currencies in the world. This is the foundation for Bitcoin’s perception of value.</p><p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) present another democratization pathway. The purpose of ETFs is to track an asset’s price, represented by shares, and enable trading throughout the day unlike actively managed mutual funds. The ETFs’ passive price tracking ensures lower fees, making it an accessible investment vehicle.</p><p>Of course, it would be up to Bitcoin custodians like Coinbase to enact sufficient <a href="https://cast.ai/cloud-security/">cloud security</a> to instill investor confidence. </p><p>In the ETF universe, Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated high demand for a decentralized asset that is resistant to centralized dilution. Altogether in the last 15 days, they have resulted in $29.3 billion trading volume against $14.9 billion pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC (GBTC).</p><figure>

                    <p>This is not surprising. As Bitcoin price moved up due to Bitcoin ETF hype, 88% of all Bitcoin holders entered the profit zone in December 2023, eventually reaching <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=supply.LthProfitSum">90%</a> in February. In turn, GBTC investors were cashing out, placing a downward pressure worth $5.6 billion on Bitcoin price.</p><p>Moreover, GBTC investors took advantage of lower fees from the newly approved Bitcoin ETFs, shifting funds from GBTC’s relatively high 1.50% fee. At the end of the day, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the volume winner at 0.12% fee, which will go up to 0.25% after a 12-month waiver period.</p><p>To place this in the context of the wider ETF universe, IBIT and FBTC managed to outpace iShares Climate Conscious & Transition MSCI USA ETF (USCL), launched in June 2023, within a month of trading. </p><figure>

                    <p>This is particularly indicative given that Bitcoin’s history is one of attacks coming from the sustainability direction. It bears reminding that Bitcoin price fell 12%, in May 2021, shortly after <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203">Elon Musk tweeted</a> that Tesla no longer accepts BTC payments precisely due to eco concerns.</p><p>During January, IBIT and FBTC found themselves at 8th and 10th place respectively as ETFs with the largest net asset inflows, headed by iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/etf-flows-investors-curb-their-enthusiasm-january">Morning Star report</a>. With daily ~10,000 BTC streaming into ETFs, this represents a greatly lopsided demand over <a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-mined-per-day/">~900 BTC</a> mined per day.</p><p>Moving forward, as the GBTC outflow pressure wanes and inflow trend increases, the steady stream of funds into Bitcoin ETFs is poised to stabilize BTC price.</p><h2>The Mechanism of Stabilization</h2><p>With 90% of Bitcoin holders entering the profit zone, highest since October 2021, selloff pressures can come from many sources, institutional, miner and retail. The higher inflow trend in Bitcoin ETFs is the bulwark against it, especially heading into another hype event - <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitcoin-halving-why-this-time-could-be-different">4th Bitcoin halving</a>. </p><p>Higher trading volumes generate higher liquidity, smoothing out price movements. That’s because larger volumes between both buyers and sellers absorb temporary imbalances. During January, <a href="https://etp.coinshares.com/knowledge/market-activity/portfolio-dynamics-january-2024?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Market_PortfolioDynamics_0124&utm_content=Portfolio-dynamics-Jan24">CoinShares’ report</a> showed $1.4 billion of Bitcoin inflows, together with $7.2 billion from newly issued US-based funds, against the GBTC outflows of $5.6 billion.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NTQwNTQ4/image8.png" height="645" width="1200">

                    </figure>
                    <p>In the meantime, large financial institutions are setting new liquidity baselines. As of February 6th, Fidelity Canada set up 1% Bitcoin allocation within its <a href="https://www.fidelity.ca/en/products/funds/ace/">All-in-One Conservative ETF Fund</a>. Given its “conservative” moniker, this signals even greater percentage allocations in future non-conservative funds.</p><p>Ultimately, if Bitcoin taps into 1% of the $749.2 trillion market pool of various asset classes, Bitcoin’s market cap could grow to $7.4 trillion, bringing Bitcoin price to $400k.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NDA5NDc2/image5.png" height="800" width="998">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Given that Bitcoin ETFs provide a consistent and transparent market price reference point, large aggregated trades reduce market impact on potential selloffs coming from miners. This is visible from <a href="https://www.falconx.io/newsroom/are-we-entering-a-new-market-regime-the-growing-influence-of-macro-on-crypto-prices">FalconX Research</a>, showing a great uptick in daily aggregate volumes, previously from average 5% heading into the 10 - 13% range.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NDA5NTk2/image2.png" height="530" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>In other words, the new Bitcoin ETF-induced market regime is reducing overall market volatility. So far, Bitcoin miners have been the main price-suppressing driver on the other side of the liquidity equation. In Bitfinex’s latest weekly on-chain report, miner wallets were responsible for 10,200 BTC in outflows.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NTQwNjY4/image6.png" height="713" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>This matches the aforementioned ~10,000 BTC inflows in Bitcoin ETFs, resulting in relatively stable price levels. As miners reinvest and upgrade mining rigs ahead of the 4th halving, another stabilizing mechanism could come into play - options.</p><p>Although the SEC is yet to approve options on spot-traded BTC ETFs, this development will further expand ETF liquidity. After all, the greater spectrum of investing strategies revolving around hedging increases liquidity on both sides of the trade. </p><p>As a forward-looking metric, <a href="https://thetradinganalyst.com/implied-volatility/">implied volatility</a> in options trading gauges market sentiment. But the greater market maturity that we will inevitably see following the introduction of BTC ETFs, we’re more likely to see a more stabilized pricing of options and derivative contracts in general.</p><h2>Analyzing Inflows and Market Sentiment</h2><p>As of February 9th, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) holds 468,786 BTC. Over the last week, the BTC price went up 8.6% to $46.2k. Concurrent with the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-etf-inflows-in-context-">previous forecast</a>, this means that BTC dumping is likely to spread out over multiple rallies ahead of the 4th halving and beyond.</p><p>By latest numbers provided by <a href="https://farside.co.uk/?p=997">Farside Investors</a>, as of February 8th, Bitcoin ETFs have racked up $403 million inflows, totaling to $2.1 billion. GBTC outflows totaled $6.3 billion.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NDc1MDEy/image7.png" height="800" width="585">

                    </figure>
                    <p>From January 11th to February 8th, GBTC outflows have steadily decreased. Within the first week, they averaged $492 million. In the second week, GBTC outflows averaged $313 million, ending in $115 million on average during the third week.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NDc1MTMy/image3.png" height="800" width="884">

                    </figure>
                    <p>On a weekly basis, this represents a 36% reduction on sell pressure from week one to two, and 63% reduction from week two to three.</p><p>As GBTC FUD unfolded up to February 9th, crypto fear & greed index elevated to “greed” at 72 points. This represents a revisit to January 12th, at 71 points, just a few days after Bitcoin ETF approvals.</p><p>Looking ahead, it bears noticing that Bitcoin price is reliant on global liquidity. After all, it was the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle in March 2022 that caused the avalanche of crypto bankruptcies, culminating in the FTX collapse.

                    <p>Considering the insurmountable national debt of $34 trillion, while the federal spending keeps <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/">outpacing revenue</a>, Bitcoin is positioning itself as a safe haven asset. One that waits for capital inflows into its limited 21 million coin supply.</p><h2>Historical Context and Future Implications</h2><p>As a similar safe haven asset, Gold Bullion Securities (GBS) launched as the first gold ETF in March 2003 on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Next year, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) launched on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). </p><p>Within a week from November 18th, 2004, <a href="https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/usa/historical-data/">GLD’s total net assets</a> rose up from $114,920,000 to $1,456,602,906. By the end of December, this decreased to $1,327,960,347. To reach BlackRock’s IBIT market value of <a href="https://www.ishares.com/ch/professionals/en/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust">$3.5 billion</a>, it took GLD up to November 22nd 2005.</p><p>Although not inflation-adjusted, this indicates Bitcoin’s superior market sentiment compared to gold. Bitcoin is digital, yet it is grounded in a proof-of-work mining network spanning the globe. Its digital nature translates to portability which can not be said of gold. </p><p>The USG showcased this point when President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102 in 1933 for citizens to sell their gold bullions. Likewise, new gold veins are frequently discovered which dampens its limited supply status in contrast to Bitcoin.</p><p>In addition to these fundamentals, Bitcoin ETF options are yet to materialize. Nonetheless, Standard Chartered analysts project $50 to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Moreover, large companies are yet to follow MicroStrategy’s lead by effectively converting shares sales into a depreciating asset.</p><p>Even 1% BTC allocations across mutual funds are poised to skyrocket BTC price. Case in point, <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/SEC+Filings/Form+497K+Advisors+Preferred+Trust/22582132.html">Advisors Preferred Trust</a> set up a 15% range allocation into indirect Bitcoin exposure via futures contracts and BTC ETFs. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>After 15 years of doubt and aspersions, Bitcoin has reached the apex of credibility. The first wave of believers in sound money ensured that the blockchain version of it is not lost in the bin of coding history.</p><p>On the back of their confidence, up until now, Bitcoin investors constituted the second wave. The Bitcoin ETF milestone represents the third wave exposure milestone. Central banks around the world continue to erode confidence in money, as governments cannot help themselves but to indulge in spending.</p><p>With so much noise introduced into the exchange of value, Bitcoin represents a return to the sound money root. Its saving grace is digital, but also physical proof-of-work as energy. Barring extreme USG action to sabotage institutional exposure, Bitcoin could even overtake gold as a traditional safe haven asset.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shane Neagle.

When talking about fiat currencies, debasement traditionally refers to the practice of reducing the precious metal content in coins while keeping their nominal value the same, thereby diluting the coin’s intrinsic worth. In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency — such as when central banks increase the supply of money, in the process lowering the nominal value of each unit.</p><h2>UNDERSTANDING DEBASEMENT</h2><p>Before paper money and coins made of cheap metals like nickel, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver. These were the most sought after metals of the time, giving them value beyond government decree. Debasement was a common practice to save on precious metals and use them in a mix of lower-value metals instead.</p><p>This practice of mixing the precious metals with a lower-quality metal means authorities could create additional coins with the same face value, expanding the money supply for a fraction of the cost compared to coins with more gold and silver content.</p><p>Today, coins and notes don't have inherent worth, they are simply tokens that represent value. This means debasement relies on supply: i.e. how many coins or notes the issuing body allows to circulate. Debasement went through different processes and methods over time; therefore, we can define old and new methods.</p><h3>TRADITIONAL METHOD</h3><p>Coin clipping, sweating, and plugging were the most common debasement processes used until the introduction of paper money. Such methods were employed both by malicious actors that counterfeited coins and by authorities that increased the number of coins in circulation.</p><p>Clipping involves “shaving” the coins’ edges to remove some of the metal. As with sweating, the resulting clipped bits would be collected and used to make new counterfeit coins.</p><p>Sweating involves shaking coins vigorously in a bag until the edges of the coins come off and lay at the bottom. The pieces are then collected and used to create new coins.</p><p>Plugging was a way of punching a hole out of the coin’s middle area with the rest of the coin hammered together to close the gap. It could also be sawn in half with a plug of metal extracted from the interior. After filling the hole with a cheaper metal, the two halves would be fused again.</p><h3>MODERN-DAY METHODS</h3><p>Money supply increase is the modern method used by governments to debase the currency. By printing more money, governments get more funds to spend but it results in inflation for its citizens. Currency can be debased by increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, or implementing other measures that encourage inflation; they’re all “good” ways of reducing the value of a currency.</p><h2>WHY IS MONEY DEBASED?</h2><p>Governments debase their currency so that they can spend without raising further taxes. Debasing money to fund wars was an effective way of increasing the money supply to engage in expensive conflicts without affecting people’s finances — or so it is believed.</p><p>Whether by traditional debasement or modern money printing, money supply increases have short-sighted benefits in boosting the economy. But in the long term, it leads to inflation and financial crises. The effects of this are felt most acutely by those in society who do not own hard assets that might counter the loss in the currency’s value.</p><p>Currency debasement could also occur by malicious actors who introduce counterfeit coins to an economy, but the consequence of being caught can in some countries lead to a death sentence.</p><p><em>“Inflation is legal counterfeiting, Counterfeiting is illegal inflation.”</em> - Robert Breedlove</p><p>Governments can take some measures to mitigate risks associated with money debasement and prevent unstable and weak economies, for example by controlling the money supply and interest rates within a specific range, managing spending, and avoiding excessive borrowing.</p><p>Any economic reform that promotes productivity and attracts foreign investments helps maintain confidence in the currency and prevent money debasement.</p><h2>REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES</h2><h3>The Roman Empire</h3><p>The first example of currency debasement dates back to the Roman Empire under emperor Nero around 60 A.D. Nero reduced the silver content in the denarius coins from 100% to 90% during his tenure.</p><p>Emperor Vespasian and his son Titus had enormous expenditures via post-civil war reconstruction projects like the building of the Colosseum, compensation to the victims of the Vesuvius eruption, and the Great Fire of Rome in 64 A.D. The chosen means to survive the financial crisis was to reduce the silver content of the “denarius” from 94% to 90%.</p><p>Titus’ brother and successor, Domitian, saw enough value in “hard money” and the stability of a credible money supply that he increased the silver content of the denarius back to 98% — a decision he had to revert when another war broke out, and inflation was looming again across the empire.</p><p>This process gradually continued until the silver content measured just 5% in the following centuries. The Empire began to experience severe financial crises and inflation as the money continued to be devalued — particularly during the 3rd century A.D., sometimes referred to as the “Crisis of the Third Century.” During this period, spanning from about A.D. 235 to A.D. 284, Romans demanded higher wages and an increase in the price of the goods they were selling to face currency depreciation. The era was marked by political instability, external pressures from barbarian invasions, and internal issues such as economic decline and plague.</p><p>It was only when Emperor Diocletian and later Constantine took various measures, including introducing new coinage and implementing price controls, that the Roman economy began to stabilize. However, these events highlighted the vulnerabilities of the once-mighty Roman economic system.</p><p>Read More >> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/hard-money-hyperinflation-roman-empire">Hard To Soft Money: The Hyperinflation Of The Roman Empire</a></p><h3>OTTOMAN EMPIRE</h3><p>During the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman official monetary unit, the akçe, was a silver coin that went through consistent debasement from 0.85 grams contained in a coin in the 15th century down to 0.048 grams in the 19th century. The measure to lower the intrinsic value of the coinage was taken to make more coins and increase the money supply. New currencies, the kuruş in 1688 and then the lira in 1844, gradually replaced the original official akçe due to its continuous debasement.</p><h3>HENRY VIII</h3><p>Under Henry VIII, England needed more money, so his chancellor started to debase the coins using cheaper metals like copper in the mix to make more coins for a more affordable cost. At the end of his reign, the silver content of the coins went down from 92.5% to only 25% as a way to make more money and fund the heavy military expenses the current European war was demanding.</p><h3>WEIMAR REPUBLIC</h3><p>During the Weimar Republic of the 1920s, the German government met its war and post-war financial obligations by printing more money. The measure reduced the mark’s value from around eight marks per dollar to 184. By 1922, the mark had depreciated to 7,350, eventually collapsing in a painful <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> when it reached 4.2 trillion marks per USD.</p><p>History offers us poignant reminders of the perils of monetary expansion. These once-powerful empires all serve as cautionary tales for the modern fiat system. As these empires expanded their money supply, devaluing their currencies, they were, in many ways, like the proverbial lobster in boiling water. The temperature — or in this case, the rate of monetary debasement — increased so gradually that they failed to recognize the impending danger until it was too late. Just as a lobster doesn't appear to realize it’s being boiled alive if the water’s temperature rises slowly, these empires didn’t grasp the full extent of their economic vulnerabilities until their systems became untenable.</p><p>The gradual erosion of their monetary value was not just an economic issue; it was a symptom of deeper systemic problems, signaling the waning strength of once-mighty empires.</p><h2>DEBASEMENT IN THE MODERN ERA</h2><p>The dissolution of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s marked a pivotal moment in global economic history. Established in the mid-20th century, the Bretton Woods system had loosely tethered major world currencies to the U.S. dollar, which itself was backed by gold, ensuring a degree of economic stability and predictability.</p><p>However, its dissolution effectively untethered money from its golden roots. This shift granted central bankers and politicians greater flexibility and discretion in monetary policy, allowing for more aggressive interventions in economies. While this newfound freedom offered tools to address short-term economic challenges, it also opened the door to misuse and a gradual weakening of the economy.<br><br>In the wake of this monumental change, the US has experienced significant alterations in its monetary policy and money supply. By 2023, the monetary base had surged to 5.6 trillion dollars, representing an approximate 69-fold growth from its level of 81.2 billion dollars in 1971.</p><p>As we reflect on the modern era and the significant changes in U.S. monetary policy, it’s crucial to heed these historical lessons. Continuous debasement and unchecked monetary expansion can only go on for so long before the system reaches a breaking point.</p><h2>EFFECTS OF DEBASEMENT</h2><p>Currency debasement can have several significant effects on an economy, varying in magnitude depending on the extent of debasement and the underlying economic conditions.</p><p>Here are some of the most impactful consequences that currency debasement can generate over the long term.</p><h3>Higher inflation rates</h3><p>Higher inflation rates are the most immediate and impactful effects of currency debasement. As the currency’s value decreases, it takes more units to purchase the same goods and services, eroding the purchasing power of money.</p><h3>Increasing Interest Rates</h3><p>Central banks may respond to currency debasement and rising inflation by increasing interest rates, which can impact borrowing costs, business investments, and consumer spending patterns.</p><h3>Deteriorating the Value of Savings</h3><p>Currency debasement can deteriorate the value of savings held in the domestic currency. This is particularly detrimental to individuals with fixed-income assets, such as retirees who rely on pensions or interest income.</p><h3>More Expensive Imports</h3><p>A debased currency can make imports more expensive, potentially leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers reliant on foreign goods. However, it may also make exports more competitive internationally, as foreign buyers can purchase domestic goods at a lower price.</p><h3>Undermining Public Confidence in the Economy</h3><p>Continuous currency debasement can undermine public confidence in the domestic currency and the government’s ability to manage the economy effectively. This loss of trust may further exacerbate economic instability and even <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a>.</p><h2>SOLUTION TO DEBASEMENT</h2><p>The solution to debasement lies in the reintroduction of sound money — money whose supply cannot be easily manipulated. While many nostalgically yearn for a return to the gold standard, which was arguably superior to contemporary systems, it is not the ultimate solution. The reason lies in the centralization of gold by central banks. Should we revert to a gold standard, history would likely repeat itself, leading to confiscation and the debasement of currencies once again. Put simply, if a currency can be debased, it will be.</p><h3>How Bitcoin Avoids Debasement</h3><p>Bitcoin offers a permanent solution to this issue. Its supply is capped at 21 million, a number that is hard-coded and safeguarded by proof-of-work mining and a decentralized network of nodes. Thanks to its decentralized nature, no single entity or government can control Bitcoin’s issuance or governance. Furthermore, its inherent scarcity makes it resilient to the inflationary pressures that are typically seen with traditional fiat currencies.</p><p>As a distributed system, Bitcoin users can ensure that the supply never deviates from the predetermined supply cap by running the software that downloads and validates the entire transactional ledger. By verifying every transaction in Bitcoin’s history, where every coin came from and where it went, users can be absolutely sure that the supply has not been debased and no coins were created that should not have been.</p><p>Full node software like this for Bitcoin is essentially a counterfeiting detection machine that anyone can run. It guarantees the supply is intact, that coins being spent were properly authorized, and no funny business is happening. Any Bitcoin wallet software can also ensure that no one can restrict your access to your own money. </p><p>In times of economic uncertainty, or when central banks engage in extensive money printing, investors often turn to assets like gold and bitcoin for their store-of-value properties. As time progresses, there’s potential for people to recognize Bitcoin not just as a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a>, but as the next evolution of money.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDEzMTQ5Nzk4MTE1MDY4/ledger-10-steps-intro---article-preview.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDEzMTQ5Nzk4MTE1MDY4/ledger-10-steps-intro---article-preview.png"><media:title>ledger-10-steps-intro---article-preview</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy To Raise $500 Million To Buy More Bitcoin ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Just two days ago, MicroStrategy bought $821.7 million worth of bitcoin, and now they're going to buy more.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/michael-saylors-microstrategy-to-raise-500-million-to-buy-more-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/michael-saylors-microstrategy-to-raise-500-million-to-buy-more-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[microstrategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[michael saylor]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 20:45:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTk4MjA3MzM4NDU2ODI4/giy5m66wqaaarov.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MicroStrategy® Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR) has <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-proposed-private-offering-of-500-million-of-convertible-senior-notes_03-13-2024">revealed</a> plans to raise $500 million to buy more bitcoin through a private offering of convertible senior notes due 2031.

Using only the first four letters of the BIP39 seed words, a 12-word seed phrase can be stored in a mere 48 nucleotides of DNA. (For comparison, the average gene is several thousand nucleotides long, and the complete human genome contains over 3 billion nucleotides). Any genetics graduate student could, in just a few days, turn my seed word sequence into an actual strand of DNA and insert that DNA into <em>E. coli </em>or some other suitable host for storage (and propagation) inside a living organism. </p><p>DNA is just one modality for storing and transmitting information. There are numerous other ways to do so and once information is widely distributed it is nearly impossible to extinguish, which is why it will be impossible to stop Bitcoin on a global scale with regulation, legislation, or even violence. The mere fact that you can store a bitcoin private key in DNA demonstrates the futility of attempting to ban Bitcoin. Once unleashed, information is hard to contain. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkzOTg2MTkwOTExMjI4/image1.png" height="800" width="909">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>But why is information so hard to contain? Perhaps because information is a fundamental entity of the universe. For centuries scientists thought the universe was made only of matter and energy. Today, we know it is made of matter, energy, and information. Information can be stored in matter and transmitted using energy, but information itself is neither. Einstein showed us that matter and energy are interchangeable (E=mc2) but <em>in toto</em> cannot be created nor destroyed. By contrast, information can be created and destroyed, but neither is easy. And once information is created and widely distributed, it is increasingly difficult to destroy. </p><h2>The Parts of Information</h2><p>Information is meant to be sent and received between two or more parties. It is done with a purpose by the sender and is meant to spur action in the receiver. There are five hierarchical components to information:</p><ol><li>Fidelity</li><li>Syntax (code or grammar)</li><li>Semantics (meaning)</li><li>Pragmatics (action)</li><li>Apobetics (purpose)</li></ol><h2>Fidelity</h2><p>Fidelity is the lowest element of information, but it is absolutely necessary for successful transmission. It was once a major issue for cell phone and internet communication. Remember the <em>“Can you hear me now?”</em> commercial? With technical advancements, low fidelity eventually became high fidelity (which weirdly became wireless fidelity, or Wi-Fi). Generally, we are not concerned with fidelity unless it is lacking. (<em>Can you hear me now?)</em></p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkzOTkxMDIyNzQ5MzE2/image2.png" height="603" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h2>The Code and Language</h2><p>Syntax refers to the code or grammar used for transmitting information. A code is a set of symbols that represent temporally or spatially interconnectable bits of information. That is, symbols can be strung together in time or space to achieve the next level of information (semantics). The symbols used can vary tremendously. They include, among other things, the letters that make up an alphabet, hand gestures (e.g., American Sign Language), musical notes (e.g., those old modem connections and touch tone phones), or the nucleotides in DNA and RNA. The number of symbols used can vary, as well. Most alphabets use 20-35 letters, the nucleotide code uses four chemicals (abbreviated A, U, C, and G), and the binary code employed by computers has just two symbols (0 and 1) representing the on and off states. The number and type of symbols employed are not selected randomly. For instance, they may be determined by the mode of transmission or to meet a specific need (Table 1). </p><p>Table 1: Symbols may be chosen for mode of transmission or to meet a specific need.</p><p>A common code is essential for information to be successfully communicated. That is, the code must be known to both the sender and the receiver. Also, because the code is not itself the information but merely the purveyor of information, any particular code can be <em>translated</em> to any other code. For example, written human languages can be translated from one to another: </p><p><em>Go tell it on the mountain…</em></p><p><em>Va le dire sur la montagne…</em></p><p><em>Ve a contario en la montaña…</em></p><p>The above phrase can also be translated, using human eyes, brain, and mouth, from symbols on a page into sound waves (acoustic symbols) in the air, which can be picked up by a microphone and converted to electrical signals in wires and then to radio waves transmitted through space to be picked up by an antenna on the space station, turned back into electrical signals, and then converted by a speaker back into sound waves to be heard by the ears of another human. In the ears of our human astronaut, the signal is converted from waves of air to waves of fluid in the cochlea and then to electrical nerve impulses carried to the brain to be interpreted by neurons. In the brain, those neurons somehow make sense of the original string of symbols, which brings us to the next level of information: semantics or meaning. </p><h2>Semantics, Pragmatics, and Apobetics</h2><p>Semantics is the meaning or intent of a message (a string of symbols). The allocation of meaning to symbols is a mental process. This doesn’t happen at the machine level but at the human level. When you read a book, you are not interested in fidelity (unless it is lacking) or syntax (unless the grammar is horrible or it’s a language you do not understand). Instead, you are interested in the <em>meaning</em> conveyed by the message, i.e., the semantics. Although computers can store and transmit information with ease, and can even perform logic operations via transistors, they cannot meaningfully interpret information the way a human can. Do raspberry pi nodes, hardware wallets, or ASICs understand Bitcoin the way a human does? I think not.</p><p>The aim of meaningful communication is to prompt some action in the recipient. This aim for action represents the pragmatic level of information. The reason the sender wishes to prompt this response is the purpose of the information, which is the apobetic level of information. These highest levels of information require genuine intelligence on both parties, even a will. Whether or not computers can ever possess a will remains to be seen. </p><p>“Go tell it on the mountain…” is a string of symbols (code) that create a meaningful message (semantics) with the sender expecting (apobetics) some response from the receiver (pragmatics). The message can only be received if transmitted adequately (good fidelity). </p><h2>Bitcoin as Information</h2><p>Bitcoin (the program) is computer code written in a particular coding language. From the software to the blockchain to the key pairs of wallets, bitcoin is information. This information can be stored, transmitted, and replicated in flash drives, printed books, or DNA molecules. Because it is now so widely dispersed, it is virtually impossible at this point to destroy. Politicians and bankers may not like it, but the genie is out of the bottle and cannot be stopped now. As they say, you cannot ban Bitcoin, you can only ban yourself from using Bitcoin. </p><p>Fidelity and syntax are the operational parts of information. Semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics are the higher levels of information concerned with the purpose and response of intelligent beings based on the meaning of the message. In Bitcoin, fidelity – or clarity of transmission – is achieved by the internet (and has even been accomplished by HAM radio) connecting a network of nodes, miners, and wallets. The syntax of Bitcoin consists of the coding languages used to write and execute Bitcoin Core and related software on those devices. The meaning, or semantics, of Bitcoin is a perfectly scarce, immutable, digital token. The highest purposes of Bitcoin – the pragmatics and apobetics – are demonstrated in the users that run miners, nodes, and wallets who are motivated and seeking to secure their wealth from theft, either by robbery or debasement. </p><p>The internet is now a mature and high-fidelity communication system. It cannot be destroyed without simultaneously destroying humanity as we know it. The computer codes and languages utilized by Bitcoin are sufficiently distributed such that eliminating them is essentially impossible. But even if you could somehow destroy the fidelity and syntax of the network, the <em>idea</em> of Bitcoin – the semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics – is too widely distributed to defeat. At this point, it has found its way into the minds of millions of people around the globe. Perhaps you could destroy the internet and every last hard drive holding the blockchain and every last computer running Bitcoin, but you would have to hunt down every last Bitcoiner to eradicate the idea of Bitcoin. And who knows, due to the ungovernable actions of some mad scientist, you might have to hunt down all the <em>E. coli</em>, too. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Daniel Howell.

                    <p>Bitcoin has had another period of intense and record-breaking success, spurred on both by positive developments in international business and by increasingly large commitments from the spheres of traditional finance. </p><p>It’s truly stunning how well Bitcoin has been performing throughout the first quarter of 2024. The year began with Bitcoin’s valuation crossing the $40k mark, and March 1 saw a persistent hover around $60k. Now, however, Bitcoin has gone up to $72k, the highest valuation in its entire history. Although we still are not quite at the level where “digital gold” is more valuable than gold itself, we have even reached a new milestone: by market cap, Bitcoin is currently a more <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/11/bitcoins-market-cap-jumps-to-14t-surpassing-silver/">valuable</a> commodity than silver. Considering the immense role that silver has played in global currency for thousands of years, this is certainly a milestone to remember. </p><p>This period of success has been especially noteworthy for the continued confidence it’s been enjoying from some of the largest financial institutions in the world. On March 10, for example, it was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-holds-more-btc-microstrategy">reported</a> that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and prominent issuer of the Bitcoin spot ETF, had finally acquired enough bitcoin that it surpassed even the holdings of MicroStrategy. Considering that its board chairman, Michael Saylor, is such a Bitcoin evangelist, this development seemed especially huge. It was an even bigger surprise, however, when Saylor announced that he was buying enough to <a href="https://decrypt.co/221151/microstrategy-205000-bitcoin-treasury">reclaim</a> its leading position the very next day. Less than 24 hours passed between this original announcement and MicroStrategy’s purchase of 12k bitcoin, and this purchase took place when Bitcoin was already enjoying a price point over $70k. This purchase put MicroStrategy at the head of nearly every other private bitcoin stockpile, from all publicly traded miners to several major exchanges and ETF issuers.</p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>It’s a stunning display of confidence in Bitcoin that anyone is prepared to make such major investments at a time when it’s never been more expensive. It seems that the mood in these companies is that the all-time highs of today will seem like a paltry sum in just a few years. Analysts from ETF issuer Bitwise, for example, were confident enough in their <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/large-corporations-wirehouses-prepare-bitcoin-etf-bitwise">prediction</a> that corporate entities representing trillions of dollars would begin ramping up investments that Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer released an official <a href="https://twitter.com/BitwiseInvest/status/1766162033311973474">memo</a> on the subject. Claiming “serious due diligence” conversations with everyone from hedge funds to massive corporations, the memo predicts that Q2 will see even more massive inflows than the first three months of the year. This just leaves us with one question: Where does this kind of confidence come from?</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkyMzIyOTY0ODI1NzMy/5690a0f9-6323-450a-ad26-5dbb9a0a6f7f_1600x466.jpg" height="349" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>The center of the issue seems to be the runaway success of the Bitcoin ETF and, in particular, BlackRock’s dominating position over the main issuers. Initially, it struggled with Grayscale, which had several natural advantages: it was a Bitcoin-native company with a massive stockpile, it was a real leader in the legal battle to actually get SEC approval, its GBTC was a previously-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, and it had other tricks up its sleeve. Nevertheless, BlackRock is the ETF that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1bb8413e-b974-4e05-933e-7ffedec62bdb">reached</a> $10 billion faster than any other in history, shooting ahead of all other Bitcoin competitors and indeed all ETFs in general. Much of this revenue came from users fleeing GBTC’s high fees, and it seems like a confident industry leader today. Its success has even matured to the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/03/11/indian-crypto-investment-platform-mudrex-to-offer-us-bitcoin-etfs-to-indian-investors/">international</a> stage, as Mudrex, a crypto investment platform based in India, is opening up BlackRock ETF sales to institutional and private investors in a country with more than 1 billion people.</p><p>This kind of success from BlackRock in particular has also led some of its competitors to change up their tactical approach. VanEck, for example, made an <a href="https://twitter.com/vaneck_us/status/1767227350108794991">announcement</a> on March 11 that they were waiving all fees on their Bitcoin ETF for an entire year. This will only continue so long as their VanEck Bitcoin Trust is under $1.5 billion, but the fees after this window will still be some of the lowest available. Grayscale, for its part, is also seeking to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/12/grayscale-gbtc-bitcoin-etf-mini-version">address</a> the problem of high fees by spinning off a “mini-version” of its ETF, offering fractions of Bitcoin for a fraction of GBTC’s fees. It seems that BlackRock’s competitors are not yet willing to concede a market with such tremendous growth potential.</p><p>However, although the ETF market has been especially hot lately, that is not the only reason to believe that Bitcoin’s doing so well. <em>ABC News</em>, for example, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/bitcoin-soars-record-high-uk-approval-crypto-asset/story?id=108004016">credits</a> some positive developments from the United Kingdom as a major factor in Bitcoin’s price jump. Britain has previously been <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/new-uk-rules-cause-consternation">considered</a> a particularly hostile regulatory environment for Bitcoin, especially the ETF, trailing behind both Western Europe and most of the Anglosphere in official Bitcoin approval. It was quite a surprise, then, when the London Stock Exchange (LSE) <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/london-stock-exchange-to-accept-bitcoin-exchange-traded-note-applications">released</a> a new factsheet on exchange-traded notes (ETNs), deciding that this type of financial instrument would be offered on their platform.</p><p>ETNs do differ substantially from ETFs, even those like the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has no direct link to Bitcoin itself. ETNs are a type of debt security and do not even include the proviso that the issuer actually holds the bitcoin in question. Still, they are directly tied to the value of Bitcoin and offer investors a way to gain exposure to the world’s leading digital asset. Considering that these ETNs are subject to the stringent rules that govern securities, it’s particularly interesting that the LSE has suddenly changed its tune on Bitcoin-related financial products. In other words, it seems that the sea change in legal Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States has undeniably changed the calculus for businesses worldwide. With all these billions flowing into the Bitcoin ETF, even an unfriendly regulator like Great Britain must join in the bonanza if it wishes to maintain relevance as a leading hub of global finance. </p><p>These are just a few of the developments that have occurred in the world of Bitcoin, as the intersection between decentralized currency and traditional finance has become both broader and deeper. Looking forward, there are still plenty of upcoming events, like the halving predicted in April, to keep propelling the hype forward. It may be difficult to predict exactly where the next major development and price jump will come from, but right now it looks as if there is a growing faith coming from some true financial giants. Bitcoin has come an incredibly long way since the days of its total pariah status, and now there’s well over a trillion dollars in the market. With growth like that, it’s an easy win to keep betting on Bitcoin. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkyMjg2NzI2MDM5Mjky/rocketmoon.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkyMjg2NzI2MDM5Mjky/rocketmoon.jpg"><media:title>rocketmoon</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkyMzIyOTY0ODI1NzMy/5690a0f9-6323-450a-ad26-5dbb9a0a6f7f_1600x466.jpg"><media:title>5690a0f9-6323-450a-ad26-5dbb9a0a6f7f_1600x466</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BitGo Rolls Out RBF Integration for Faster Bitcoin Transaction Processing]]></title><description><![CDATA[BitGo users will now have the capability to replace transactions that are currently stalled with higher fees.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitgo-rolls-out-rbf-integration-for-faster-bitcoin-transaction-processing</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitgo-rolls-out-rbf-integration-for-faster-bitcoin-transaction-processing</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transactions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitgo]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Rbf]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTcwNTYxMTcwODQzMzg4/b4a8fb4e-1e18-48a9-a277-6fa9d20f8b0a.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bitgo.com/">BitGo</a>, a prominent provider of Bitcoin wallets and custody solutions, has unveiled a new enhancement to its platform with the introduction of Replace-By-Fee (RBF) integration, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.

Spearheaded by Nexo, this global initiative is dedicated to securing an official Bitcoin emoji for digital keyboards everywhere, signaling a monumental step toward recognizing Bitcoin's multifaceted role in society as a revolutionary technology, a form of money, and a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>“Bitcoin's journey reflects a remarkable blend of innovation and community,” stated Kosta Kantchev, Co-founder & Executive Chairman of Nexo. “It's time its significance is recognized universally, starting with a symbol we all understand - an emoji. Join us in making history.”</p><p>The coalition comprises a diverse group of participants including prominent entities such as Bitcoin Magazine parent company BTC Inc, Bitget, Brink, Chainalysis, Hacken, Nansen, and Unstoppable Domains. Together, they aim to celebrate and advocate for Bitcoin's integration into the digital lexicon through the universal language of emojis.</p><p>“Bitcoin is universal money for the world, it needs a universal emoji for every person, young and old to use,” said BTC Inc CEO David Bailey.</p><p>The campaign kicks off with a 50-day petition hosted on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/bitcoin-deserves-an-emoji">Change.org</a>, culminating in an official submission to the Unicode Consortium within the 2024 submission window. This concerted effort marks a renewed push for recognition, building on previous attempts and highlighting the growing importance of Bitcoin in our daily lives.</p><p>Emojis have evolved from their origins in Japan in the 1990s to become foundational elements of digital communication, transcending linguistic and geographical barriers. According to <a href="https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/">Unicode</a>, 92% of internet users worldwide use emojis in their digital communications. The campaign for a Bitcoin emoji is more than symbolic—it's a movement to cement Bitcoin's status as an essential component of modern digital and financial ecosystems worldwide.</p><p>“Supporting Bitcoin's development has always been about paving the way for future innovation. An official emoji is more than a symbol; it's a nod to Bitcoin's technological impact on the world,” said Mike Schmidt, Executive Director of Brink.</p><p>The initiative invites everyone to join this community-driven effort.

                    <p>That car is the Bitcoineta European Edition, and the cheerful guy is Ariel Aguilar. Ariel is part of the European Bitcoineta team, and has previously driven another similar car in Argentina. In fact, there are currently five cars around the world that carry the name Bitcoineta (in some cases preceded with the Spanish definite article “La”).</p><h3>Argentina: the original La Bitcoineta</h3><p>The story of Bitcoinetas begins with the birth of 'La Bitcoineta' in Argentina, back in 2017. Inspired by the vibrancy of the South American Bitcoin community, the original Bitcoineta was conceived after an annual Latin American Conference (<a href="https://www.labitconf.com/">Labitconf</a>), where the visionaries behind it recognized a unique opportunity to promote Bitcoin education in remote areas. Armed with a bright orange Bitcoin-themed exterior and a mission to bridge the gap in financial literacy, La Bitcoineta embarked on a journey to bring awareness of Bitcoin's potential benefits to villages and towns that often remained untouched by mainstream financial education initiatives. Operated by a team of dedicated volunteers, it was more than just a car; it was a symbol of hope and empowerment for those living on the fringes of financial inclusion.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTY4MDc0Mzg0OTA5OTU2/image7.jpg" height="675" width="1200">

                    <p>Ariel was part of that initial Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and spent weeks on the road when the car became a reality. The original dream to bring bitcoin education even to remote areas within Argentina and other South American countries came true, and the La Bitcoineta team took part in dozens of local bitcoin meetups in the subsequent years.</p><figure>

                    <p>One major hiccup came in late 2018, when the car was crashed into while parked in Puerto Madryn. The car was pretty much destroyed, but since the team was possessed by a honey badger spirit, nothing could stop them from keeping true to their mission. It is a testament to the determination and resilience of the Argentinian team that the car was quickly restored and returned on its orange-pilling quest soon after.</p><figure>

                    <p>Over the more than 5 years that the Argentinian Bitcoineta has been running, it has traveled more than 80,000 kilometers - and as we’ll see further, it inspired multiple similar initiatives around the world.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrG20keYRm4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><blockquote><p>Follow La Bitcoineta’s journey:</p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/labitcoineta">https://twitter.com/labitcoineta</a> </p><p>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bitcoineta/">https://www.instagram.com/bitcoineta/</a></p></blockquote><h3>El Salvador: Bitcoin Beach </h3><p>In early 2021, the president of El Salvador passed the Bitcoin Law, making bitcoin legal tender in the country. The Labitconf team decided to celebrate this major step forward in bitcoin adoption by hosting the annual conference in San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador. And correspondingly, the Argentinian Bitcoineta team made plans for a bold 7000-kilometer road trip to visit the Bitcoin country with the iconic Bitcoin car. </p><p>However, it proved to be impossible to cross so many borders separating Argentina and Salvador, since many governments were still imposing travel restrictions due to a Covid pandemic. So two weeks before the November event, the Labitconf team decided to fund a second Bitcoineta directly in El Salvador, as part of the <a href="https://www.bitcoinbeach.com/">Bitcoin Beach</a> circular economy. Thus the second Bitcoineta was born. </p><figure>

On the other side of the planet, in South Africa, Hermann Vivier initiated the <a href="https://bitcoinekasi.com/">Bitcoin Ekasi</a> project. “Ekasi” is a colloquial term for a township, and a township in the South African context is an underdeveloped urban area with a predominantly black population, a remnant of the segregationist apartheid regime. Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as an attempt to introduce bitcoin into the economy of the JCC Camp township located in Mossel Bay, and has gained a lot of success on that front.</p><p>Bitcoin Ekasi was in large part inspired by the success of the Bitcoin Beach circular economy back in El Salvador, and the respect was mutual. The Bitcoin Beach team thus decided to pass on the favor they received from the Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and provided funds to Bitcoin Ekasi for them to build a Bitcoineta of their own. </p><figure>

                    <p>Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as a sister organization of <a href="https://www.thesurferkids.com/">Surfer Kids</a>, a non-profit organization with a mission to empower marginalized youths through surfing. The Ekasi Bitcoineta thus partially serves as a means to get the kids to visit various surfer competitions in South Africa. A major highlight in this regard was when the kids got to meet Jordy Smith, one of the most successful South African surfers worldwide.</p><p>Coincidentally, South African surfers present an intriguing demographic for understanding Bitcoin due to their unique circumstances and needs. To make it as a professional surfer, the athletes need to attend competitions abroad; but since South Africa has tight currency controls in place, it is often a headache to send money abroad for travel and competition expenses. The borderless nature of Bitcoin offers a solution to these constraints, providing surfers with an alternative means of moving funds across borders without any obstacles. </p><figure>

<p>Bitcoin exchange-traded notes are financial instruments that track the price of Bitcoin and are traded on traditional stock exchanges. By allowing the listing of Bitcoin ETNs, the LSE would be providing investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to BTC through regulated and familiar investment vehicles.</p><p>"The proposed Crypto ETN: (a) is physically backed, i.e. non-leveraged; (b) has a market price or other value measure of the underlying that is reliable and publicly available," the factsheet stated. "The underlying cryptoassets must be: (a) (i) wholly or principally held in ‘cold storage’3 (i.e. in an offline depositary wallet), which includes cold staking; or (ii) subject to arrangements that achieve an equivalent outcome to cold storage."</p><p>The decision to accept applications for Bitcoin ETNs reflects the growing demand for BTC investments among traditional investors and institutions. As the popularity of Bitcoin continues to rise, traditional financial institutions are increasingly exploring ways to incorporate them into their offerings.</p><p>The acceptance of Bitcoin ETN applications by the LSE also highlights the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding Bitcoin. With regulatory clarity improving in many jurisdictions, institutions are becoming more comfortable with offering BTC-related products to their clients.</p><p>Earlier this year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved a batch of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which turned out of be some of the most successful ETF launches in history.

<p>"I sometimes will let people pay through Bitcoin," the former President Trump stated.

And I feel that way but I will tell you it has taken on a life."</p><p>Trump's acknowledgment of Bitcoin as a payment option comes at a time when more businesses and individuals are embracing Bitcoin as a store of value and a medium of exchange.

We hope to support innovation on Bitcoin in a fair and market-neutral capacity.”</p><p>Unisat and Best In Slot have been appointed as co-lead maintainers of the BRC-20 protocol and its indexer, operating within the <a href="https://layer1.foundation/resolution">governance guidelines</a> set by L1F. Unisat, known for developing the first BRC-20 indexer in partnership with Domo, has played a pivotal role in listing BRC-20 tokens, which recently reached a market cap of $5 billion.</p><p>Concerns over the risks associated with a centralized indexer led to the development of a decentralized BRC-20 indexing solution by Best In Slot. The two companies will work together to advance the decentralization of the BRC-20 indexer as co-lead maintainers.</p><p>Moreover, Domo has appointed five Ordinals companies to the L1F Oversight Committee, tasked with enforcing governance guidelines for the BRC-20 standard. These companies, including Hiro, Allium, ALEX, Oyl Dynamics, and UTXO Management, represent major stakeholders in the BRC-20 ecosystem.</p><p>The Layer 1 Foundation, operating as a non-profit with 501(c)(6) status, aims to advance the development of metaprotocols on Bitcoin beyond BRC-20.

                    <p>Digital Currency Group, a venture capital firm, has filed a motion to dismiss a criminal suit filed against them by the New York Attorney General’s office.</p><p>The legal battle between DCG and the NYAG has been ongoing for several months, and is directly entangled with a dispute between two other prominent crypto firms: Genesis, a now-defunct brokerage firm, and Gemini, exchange and bank. These groups have been entangled in a series of disputes that trace back years, involving dramatic relationship changes and serious fraud accusations. A particularly relevant twist in the whole situation is the fact that the bankrupt Genesis is and has been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Currency_Group">subsidiary</a> of the substantially powerful DCG, which holds billions’ worth of assets under management and counts ETF issuer Grayscale as another subsidiary. </p><p>In other words, untangling the background for all the different players involved here is a fairly significant undertaking, especially considering the fraught environment that currently exists. Not only is the attorney general’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/gemini-genesis-dgc-sued-by-new-york-attorney-general-for-allegedly-defrauding-investors">suit</a> directed against DCG, Genesis and Gemini in equal measure, but Genesis and Gemini have also <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/275907/genesis-asks-bankruptcy-court-to-approve-1-4-billion-sale-of-gbtc-shares">faced off</a> in civil suits independent of this. The NYAG accused these firms in October 2023 of collectively defrauding investors out of more than $1 billion, and the mutual recriminations involved have created a messy atmosphere. To begin, as good a place as any is a recent <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/281064/genesis-gemini-possible-merger">revelation</a> found in court filings surrounding this dismissal. Specifically, court documents this March have made it public knowledge that Genesis and Gemini considered a merger in 2022.</p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>In 2022, DCG CEO Barry Silbert conducted a meeting with Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss over lunch, to discuss some of the motivations and logistical issues with merging the two corporate entities together. At the time, Genesis was in serious danger of bankruptcy, and its substantial partnerships with Gemini meant that the fallout would likely damage the other company’s business. Gemini had lent substantial funds to Genesis as part of the Gemini Earn program, which Genesis had proceeded to <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/258365/nyag-files-complaint-against-gemini-genesis-dcg-michael-moro-and-barry-silbert-over-earn-product-and-covering-up-1-billion-hole">lose</a>. The hedge fund Three Arrows Capital was in charge of this money when it went belly-up in the aftermath of the FTX collapse, and Genesis was faced with a $1 billion dilemma. As for the original source of these lost funds, the NYAG has accused the firms of defrauding this money from investors.</p><p>At the meeting, Silbert made the sales pitch that the two firms should combine, and that they “would be a juggernaut and would be competitive with Coinbase and FTX”. He added that, even if Genesis and Gemini couldn’t reach an agreement on these terms, “there is a ton more Gemini and Genesis can do together and the two companies should be leaning in together, not pulling apart”. Although Winklevoss was allegedly “<a href="https://decrypt.co/220648/dcg-genesis-gemini-merger-2022-court-documents">intrigued</a>” by the proposed deal, it did not happen. Frictions, alongside Genesis’ declaration of bankruptcy, arose in the immediate aftermath. </p><p>A particular point of friction is found in the aforementioned Gemini Earn partnership, which made <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/genesis-wins-court-ruling-to-sell">headlines</a> this February when Genesis won a court ruling against Gemini. Essentially, Genesis owned a tranche of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares that were promised to Gemini as collateral for an exchange of money between the two companies, but Genesis declared bankruptcy before the shares could actually change hands. Since GBTC is unique among the Bitcoin spot ETFs as a pre-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, this tranche of shares had ballooned by early 2024 to be worth more than $1.2B. DCG’s ownership of both Grayscale and Genesis put an extra complication over the issue. Gemini objected to Genesis’ legal right to sell the shares it was promised years prior, and this began a lengthy civil suit.</p><p>Although the issue was resolved through a series of settlements that allowed Genesis to make the sale and kept both it and Gemini from admitting culpability, the NYAG still filed a <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2024/attorney-general-james-expands-lawsuit-against-cryptocurrency-company-digital">complaint</a> alleging that the parties involved were all jointly guilty of substantial fraud. There were more than a billion dollars missing, and the attorney general’s office was growing tired of the mutual recriminations between the relevant parties. Even if Genesis could make enough money from their sale to recoup their investors, that still doesn’t address the issue of criminal activity. A particular illustration of the hostile environment came up when DCG, Genesis’ parent company, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/digital-currency-group-objects-subsidiary-genesis-settlement-nyag">disputed</a> Genesis’ own settlement with the NYAG. </p><p>So, this brings us to the present day. On March 7, Silbert and DCG <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/dcg-dismiss-lawsuit-new-york-attorney-general">filed</a> a motion to dismiss the attorney general’s suit, claiming that the allegations against these companies were entirely baseless. In the <a href="https://dcgupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DCG-Memorandum-of-Law-Motion-to-Dismiss.pdf">motion</a>, DCG’s legal team claimed that “The allegations against DCG in this case are a thin web of baseless innuendo, blatant mischaracterizations and unsupported conclusory statements. In search of a headline-worthy scapegoat for losses caused by others, the OAG [Office of the Attorney General] wrongfully seeks to portray DCG’s good-faith support of a subsidiary as participating in fraud”. They specifically claim that DCG acted in good faith by funneling money towards Genesis after the Three Arrows collapse, investing “hundreds of millions of dollars of additional capital into its subsidiary during the months leading up to its bankruptcy, even though DCG had no obligation to do so”. The attorney general took a different view, that DCG’s net contributions conceal a large drain of Genesis’ money at one crucial moment: DCG took their money back, Genesis declared a “liquidity crunch” and did not allow users to withdraw their crypto, Genesis went bankrupt immediately. The burden of proof is on them, however, to demonstrate that this was a deliberate fraud tactic. </p><p>As of yet, there is no way of knowing what a judge will think of DCG’s proposed defense or motion to dismiss, or if a settlement is feasible in the event that the motion to dismiss is denied. However, one unambiguously good sign has come out of the morass: Gemini <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coin-for-coin-payback-gemini-announces-full-recovery-of-crypto-assets-for-earn-users-after-genesis-settlement/">announced</a> its plans to fully reimburse the allegedly defrauded users of the Gemini Earn partnership with assets in kind. In other words, these users had Bitcoin stolen from them in 2022, and Gemini has made commitments to pay them back, accounting for Bitcoin’s price jump since then. This has tacked on another $700M to the price tag of reimbursing over $1B in assets, and is a clear sign of confidence from the company. </p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>If nothing else, this decision to reimburse users like this is an impressive display of sincerity and good intentions from Gemini. Gemini is <a href="https://dcgupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Barry-Silbert-Motion-to-Dismiss-March-2024.pdf">named</a> as a co-defendant on all the legal documents submitted by Silbert’s legal team about the NYAG suit, and would also benefit greatly from seeing the suit dismissed. This gesture of good faith might not be enough to clear the air for DCG and Genesis, but it certainly couldn’t hurt anyone’s chances of escaping the whole fiasco without a criminal conviction. Although Gemini failed to halt Genesis’ attempt at getting the money from GBTC sales, Gemini is still a successful and prominent exchange. Apparently, it was able to float a compensation of this size without relying on the GBTC tranche.</p><p>It’s anyone’s guess as to how the suit will proceed in the coming months. When the NYAG first filed a complaint after the first round of settlements, it seemed clear that the prosecutors were quite fed up with the acerbic attitude of these former business partners. Nevertheless, Gemini’s restitution plan will surely go a long way in proving their intention to do right by their users. If nothing else, it shows that they’re proactive in taking the issue seriously. We’ll have to observe the situation carefully as it develops, but it does seem clear that the mutual loathing and underhandedness displayed so far has not been rewarded. The broader digital asset space has periodically been filled with shaky businesses and outright scams, but eventually they all fall apart. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has come by its success legitimately. When the dust settles, the biggest winners might actually be the defrauded users, who collectively will see their expected payout nearly double thanks to Bitcoin’s own strength. Compared to those kinds of gains, it’s hard to imagine a scam working much better.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODc5MjU1NTM0ODM5Mzkw/default_barry_silbert_head_of_the_digital_currency_group_0.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODc5MjU1NTM0ODM5Mzkw/default_barry_silbert_head_of_the_digital_currency_group_0.jpg"><media:title>default_barry_silbert_head_of_the_digital_currency_group_0</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODc5MTc2NjE0ODgwODYy/596c1c74-77a8-4c85-9e1d-5d25373ed685_1303x402.jpg"><media:title>596c1c74-77a8-4c85-9e1d-5d25373ed685_1303x402</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_price">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learn Bitcoin, Earn Bitcoin: Announcing Unchained as Title Sponsor for 21 Days of Bitcoin Educational Course]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unchained will serve as Title Sponsor for 21 Days of Bitcoin, awarding Bitcoin to participants who complete a 21-day online educational course.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/learn-bitcoin-earn-bitcoin-announcing-unchained-as-title-sponsor-for-21-days-of-bitcoin-educational-course</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/learn-bitcoin-earn-bitcoin-announcing-unchained-as-title-sponsor-for-21-days-of-bitcoin-educational-course</guid><category><![CDATA[21 Days Of Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Unchained]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sponsored]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 17:15:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODc4ODI1NzY5Njc0MDc0/21-days--unchained---press-release---article-preview.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin Magazine is pleased to announce <a href="http://unchained.com/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">Unchained</a>, the leading Bitcoin financial services provider, as the Title Sponsor for “21 Days of Bitcoin”. 21 Days is Bitcoin Magazine’s email-based course teaching participants the Bitcoin basics while rewarding them with bitcoin along the way. 21 Days has educated over 120,000 course participants since its inception in 2020, and through partnership with Unchained, will continue driving forward Bitcoin education for both individuals learning about Bitcoin for the first time as well as those wanting to refresh their Bitcoin knowledge.</p><figure>

They are joined by BennyTheDev (@rarity_garden) and Alex Philippine (@Skrylabs) from Tap Protocol, bringing their technical expertise. Jason Fang (@JasonSoraVC) from Sora Ventures, a lead investor in Metagood, creators of OnChainMonkey, and the Tap Protocol is the final member of the Council.</p><p>Fostering strong relationships with other communities is something that the $KARMA Council believes will be an essential step in achieving the $KARMA community’s goals. Accordingly, a significant number of tokens have been earmarked for future ‘Karmunity’ Incentives.</p><p>The $KARMA community incentive pot will continue to activate future partnerships or activations that will help to further expand the $KARMA and Ordinals community. This could include rewarding valuable community members, partnering with additional projects, or general growth initiatives.</p><h2>The Ordinals Community Airdrop</h2><p>With this in mind, the $KARMA Council decided to airdrop 49,968,900 $KARMA tokens to communities within the Ordinals ecosystem. This was designed to push towards $Karma Council’s goal of expanding both the OCM & Ordinals ecosystems.</p><p>The Council sought to take an objective selection process. For this initial airdrop, they selected the top 9 collections by market capitalization at the time of the snapshot at Block Height 828,888 (4 February 2024). </p><p><strong>The 9 communities eligible to receive $KARMA tokens in the Community Airdrop are:</strong></p><ul><li>Bitmap (<a href="https://ordinalswallet.com/collection/bitmap">https://ordinalswallet.com/collection/bitmap</a>)</li><li>Bitcoin Punks (<a href="https://bitcoinpunks.com/">https://bitcoinpunks.com/</a>)</li><li>Bitcoin Puppets (<a href="https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/bitcoin-puppets">https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/bitcoin-puppets</a>)</li><li>Bitcoin Frogs (<a href="https://bitcoinfrogs.com/">https://bitcoinfrogs.com/</a>)</li><li>Nodemonkes (<a href="https://nodemonkes.com/">https://nodemonkes.com/</a>)</li><li>OMB (<a href="https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/omb">https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/omb</a>)</li><li>RSIC (<a href="https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/rsic">https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/rsic</a>)</li><li>PIPE (<a href="https://trac.network/Pipe/">https://trac.network/Pipe/</a>)</li><li>TRAC (<a href="https://trac.network/Pipe/">https://trac.network/</a>)</li></ul><h2>Rewarding the OCM Community</h2><p>A total of 560 million $KARMA tokens are being allocated to holders of OnChainMonkey NFTs. Eligibility for the OnChainMonkey community was based on assets being migrated from Ethereum to Bitcoin. Except for the OCM Karma collection (https://opensea.io/collection/karma-monkey), which has had their allocation of $KARMA reserved until that collection is upgraded to Bitcoin. Since the snapshot has not been completed for OCM Karma, people can still purchase the assets on ETH and when they migrate to Bitcoin, they will be eligible for the $KARMA airdrop.</p><blockquote><p>"Trac is the governance token for Tap Protocol, the first decentralized indexer economy on the Ordinals protocol enabling similar features of ERC20 but on Bitcoin L1. The TAP standard that created $KARMA was conducted by members of the OCM community but has now expanded towards 9 other Ordinals communities,” <strong>Jason Fang, founder of Sora Ventures said</strong>. “Tap protocol contains many more features compared to BRC20 that enables developers and projects to stake, send cost effective airdrops, and enable token distributions that make building on Bitcoin most cost effective, safer, and scalable.”</p><p>"$Karma embodies the spirit of innovation and community, serving as a beacon for the next generation of decentralized ecosystems. We're thrilled to champion this groundbreaking initiative led by our OnChainMonkey community members and investors," remarked <strong>Amanda Terry, co-founder and COO of Metagood</strong>. "At OnChainMonkey, we’re a community of builders and innovation and impact are woven into our DNA. Just as Bitcoin revolutionized finance, $Karma is poised to redefine collaboration, economic empowerment, and impact, with strong communities early to Ordinals at its core.” </p></blockquote><h2>Technical Milestones for Airdrops</h2><p>The airdrop of the $KARMA tokens was performed in an efficient manner utilizing “<a href="https://github.com/BennyTheDev/tap-protocol-specs">Tapping</a>,” a core feature of the TAP Protocol. “Tapping” is a process of transacting that makes it considerably cheaper and faster to distribute tokens to a large amount of addresses. Using the existing BRC-20 standard, conducting an airdrop for 61,000 wallets would have required over 122,000 transactions. The KarmaCouncil was able to complete the entire airdrop using under 55 transactions, therefore setting a precedent for the future of community inclusions for future airdrops on Bitcoin.</p><p>BRC20 requires 2 transactions for a single transfer of tokens between 2 parties. The TAP Protocol allows for many transfers within 2 transactions. 1 transaction with many receivers at once and a 2nd transaction to approve the transfers (called "tapping"). This reduces the costs for airdrops significantly in comparison to BRC20 as there is almost half of the transactions needed. It also helps to put the Bitcoin network under less stress due to lesser amounts of transactions required.</p><p>TAP Protocol's token authority feature allows it even to reduce it further using only 1 transaction, which makes it also attractive for simple individual transfers. Token authorities require additional setup configurations however, while airdrops work out of the box.</p><h3>A Note on Tap Protocol and the Technology</h3><p>Trac Core is an indexing solution (created by Trac Systems) designed to enable decentralized tracking of Ordinals metaprotocols on Bitcoin. Trac Systems is also the creator of the Tap Protocol. Creating the $KARMA tokens on the Tap Protocol was conducted by the community.

X: @Polyd_ </em></p><p>Covenants are an old yet fresh topic. As early as 2013, developers began discussing this topic, and in recent years, multiple BIPs aimed at implementing covenants have been proposed, sparking intense debates and making it one of the hottest topics.</p><p>Covenants warrant serious discussion due to their powerful capabilities. They are considered to bring new possibilities to the programmability of Bitcoin and are believed to enable smart contracts. For Bitcoin, this is undoubtedly a double-edged sword. In this article, we will explore what covenants are, how they work, their robust functionality, and their significance for Bitcoin. While discussing details, this article often uses CTV as an example, but CTV is not the only method of implementing covenants.</p><p>This article delves into the exploration of covenants but also magnifies a slice of Bitcoin under a microscope for observation. Through this observation, we can understand how Bitcoin operates at a granular level, comprehending both its capabilities and limitations. Understanding what it cannot do is as crucial as understanding what it can do because only then can we choose the right path for building on Bitcoin.</p><h2>1.</h2><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>Before discussing covenants, clarifying two issues related to Bitcoin may be necessary, which can help us better understand covenants.</p><p>We know that Bitcoin uses a scripting language, and it is known that scripting languages support the implementation of smart contracts. However, in reality, smart contracts have not been implemented on the Bitcoin main chain. This inevitably creates a sense that implementing smart contracts on Bitcoin faces some insurmountable obstacles, and it seems impossible on the Bitcoin network.</p><p>However, many people may not be aware that although Bitcoin can be programmed using a scripting language, the set of opcodes is extremely limited. This limited set of opcodes restricts the programmability scope of Bitcoin, meaning that, although the scripting language can implement smart contracts, programmers do not have sufficient "tools" to implement smart contracts.</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>Definitely, Bitcoin Script can be considered limiting as it can only perform the basic operations such as making simple payments. Some of the reasons that people may find it “limiting” is that it doesn’t have a global state, it’s not considered turing complete, it uses a UTXO-based system (which has “value blindness”) instead of an account-based system. The last big reason is that very little data from the blockchain itself can be integrated into contracts causing blockchain-blindness.</em></p><p><em>This has created a lot of challenges over the years as people have worked around these limitations. We’ve also had a semantic shift with the term “smart contract” to mean one specific thing when you should consider the lightning network a production of many smart contracts formed by many individuals. Those multi-sigs with hashlocks and timelocks are not only smart contracts, but also have time-based covenants. </em></p><p><em>The problem is, just as you mentioned before, because Bitcoin only has simple opcodes to perform just the basics, if you attempt to scale beyond two people in a smart contract, you can get either a lot of bloat for an on-chain footprint or the things you want to do just might not be possible. This strict limitation comes from a few places, I think the biggest being that when the inflation bug occurred back in 2010, Satoshi had disabled a whole list of higher order opcodes including OP_CAT which would’ve allowed us to create more dynamic smart contracts via transaction introspection.</em></p><p><em>BCH has since overcome this limitation within their own script, showing that Script isn’t as weak as everyone assumes, just that Bitcoin has always been slower due to its decentralization and coordination is near impossible except over long periods of time. We’ve also barely touched on Taproot and Tapscript which will alleviate a lot of the footprint concerns and allows for new behaviors such as BitVM by rolling up the contract into the signature and you only reveal as necessary.</em></p><p><strong>Hua: </strong></p><p>Why are there strict limitations on opcodes? Can you use OP_CAT as an example to help us understand this point? </p><p><strong>Poly: </strong></p><p><em>So OP_CAT is deceptively simple, it will take two strings and add them together. It was originally disabled because it had resource issues and could be used to cause nodes to crash, but I’m not sure if that’s the full story as Satoshi set the 520 byte stack limit </em><em>and</em><em> disabled OP_CAT in the same commit so there could be more to it than just simple resource exhaustion.</em></p><p><em>But just to give a short list of what OP_CAT can perform: CTV/TXHASH covenants, verify SPV proofs, double-spend protection for 0-conf TXs, 64-bit arithmetic, vaults, quantum-resistant signatures. The list goes on, with OP_CAT alone, it can emulate both CTV[CheckTemplateVerify] and TXHASH style transactions. The only issue is it’s highly inefficient in the manner that it performs these actions that might be possible, but that could just preclude these transactions from being desirable except by users of scale such as custodians.</em></p><h2>2.</h2><p><strong>Hua: </strong></p><p>Let's talk about another "limitation" of Bitcoin. Bitcoin only supports "verification" as a form of computation and can't do general-purpose computation.</p><p>We also know that, for example, smart contracts on Ethereum contain rules for state transitions. It completes the state transition through computation, enabling the functionality of smart contracts. In comparison, Bitcoin can't do general-purpose computation, meaning it cannot achieve state transitions through computation on its own.</p><p>Is my understanding correct? </p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>Yeah, I’d agree that’s a simple summary of the current state of things. Bitcoin could be made to support computational transactions and the line can become quite thin when covenants and state transitions are involved, but those proposals aren’t as well researched and might not be something that’s considered desirable.</em></p><p><em>I’m actually not that much of a fan of the way Ethereum does things. Due to it being computational in nature with the verification built on-top, if I attempt to perform a trade, my window could shift and I could “fail to trade” but the transaction for the attempt to trade was still valid so i still paid for fees which wasted my money on what i’d want to consider a failed transaction and wasted blockspace for someone else. Another weird aspect are the Oracles in Ethereum. Oracles must pay gas to update their oracle prices whereas in Bitcoin DLC’s, the Oracle are blinded and are just providing a signature and can’t be “pinned” due to a change in fees nor can Oracles target specific contracts.</em></p><p><em>Earlier I discussed all the downsides to the UTXO model compared to the account model and global state model, but what allows the UTXO model to shine is parallelism. The only concern you have is the child transactions to the same UTXO, nothing else matters, this allows the system to scale much better. </em></p><h2>3.</h2><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>Let's start discussing covenants now. What are covenants?</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>Covenants usually refer to restrictions on how coins can be transferred. The word covenant seems to carry some sort of connotation with it so it helps to demystify it and explain it as simple locking mechanisms you can place only on your *own* coin.</em></p><p><em>We have two covenants already inside Bitcoin and they power the Lightning Network, CSV [CheckSequenceVerify] and CLTV [CheckLockTimeVerify]. Some just call these opcodes “smart contract primitives” as they’re simple time locks, but they can also be classified as time covenants. </em></p><p><em>CTV [CheckTemplateVerify] is a proposed Bitcoin upgrade and is included in BIP 119. It is different from CSV and CLTV, you can think of CTV as a “TXID [Transaction ID] lock” or “UTXO lock”, only these TXID’s can be made from this lock. For CTV, we refer to this TXID lock as “Equality Covenants” as the resulting transactions must equal to the original transactions that were committed. It’s also called a deferred commitment covenant, as you can see that your UTXO has been committed to, but it isn’t yet placed on-chain. </em></p><p><em>The most known alternative is SH_APO [Any Previous Out or AnyPrevOut] which focuses on the payout commitment being ensured while allowing the pay-in method to be flexible. A few others discussed are OP_CCV [also known as MATT], OP_EXPIRE, TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY. </em></p><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>When you mention "covenants usually refer to restrictions on how coins can be transferred," can I understand it like this: Covenants are a method of specifying how funds can be used, or in other words, it's a way of restricting where funds can be spent.</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>Yep, it effectively earmarks the UTXO to be distributed in a specific manner, once you commit to it, you can't take it back, it's now consensus bound, and only its new owner can decide how to spend their funds.</em></p><p><em>When a UTXO is created on-chain, our instinct is to assume that a single private key is holding that UTXO in place. But if it was a CTV bound UTXO, when the UTXO is spent, you'll see an extra 32 byte hash paired with the new transaction that represents the hidden state that was inside the original UTXO.</em></p><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>You've mentioned "TXID lock/UTXO lock" multiple times. Can I understand it like this: To understand how CTV achieves their functionality, we need to understand what TXID lock is and how it works. TXID lock is a key mechanism.</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>Yes, It creates a strong foundation to build further schemes. The TXID is determined by the contents of a tx. And if you can add inputs to a tx, you can manipulate the TXID. CTV makes you lock the number of inputs and outputs. This is how we ensure that CTV commitments are trustless, if the TXID could be malleable, you could potentially be able to steal someone’s funds. Once you have a TXID locking mechanism, you combine it with other locking mechanisms such as the time locks to build even greater smart contracts. </em></p><h2>4.</h2><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>Why do you think covenants are a rabbit hole?</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>I call covenants a rabbit hole because there’s so much you can do with simple restrictions on transactions such as a time lock or a TXID lock. We’ve managed to build the entire Lightning network with simple time locks and while it isn’t perfect, it is the only truly decentralized L2 in existence. I don’t like how it’s slowly shifting towards being custodial focused, but that’s exactly why I’ve started down this rabbit hole to begin with: To make our smart contracts more powerful. We refer to the TXID lock as a Template. With Taproot, we gained the ability to have signature aggregation. With Templates and CTV, we gain the ability to have transaction aggregation.</em></p><p><em>CTV serves as a replacement for a pre-signed transaction oracle, which eliminates the trust and interactivity requirements needed to create more sophisticated smart contracts that are needed for things like vaults and payment pools. The vaults and payment pools that you can make with CTV are technically possible today, but </em><em>currently</em><em> they’re precluded by the trust or interactivity needed to make it work. Moreover, with CTV, we can build channel factories, additional layer 2 solutions such as Ark, Timeout-Trees, Stakechains or Surfchains, and JIT fidelity bond solutions such as PathCoin. </em></p><p><em>Probably my favorite feature is Non-Interactive Channels [NIC’s] that we’ve also been referring to as Cold Channels. The basic idea is to take a normal lightning channel and simply place it in a CTV template. What makes this different from a normal lightning channel is that neither party actually needed to be online to create this channel. So if I need a channel with another person, I don’t need them to be online to create it, I don’t even need to tell them I made it until I’m ready to spend from it! This allows for cold storage capability on lightning because I don’t need a watchtower nor a node to safeguard my funds in any channels that aren’t yet active. Third-party coordinators can also establish NIC’s for two individuals so there’s a lot of flexibility in what’s possible.</em></p><p><em>As it stands, CTV won’t allow you to build a DEX on-chain, but I’m not sure if that is such a bad thing as people are currently trying to build DEX’s off-chain using the Lightning Network as it is today. I think this ties back into the “Verification vs Computation” discussion, how much do you really want on-chain versus how much do you need to verify on-chain. One concern I have about on-chain DEX’s, besides the excessive on-chain updates driving higher fees, is MEV. We’ve already spotted some MEV from BCH’s DEX’s transactions and as the market matures, this is bound to get worse.</em></p><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>Can you give an example to help us understand how CTV works?</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>Let’s say I am expecting to receive 5 BTC, as of right now, the only thing I can do is receive the payment and verify it on-chain. With CTV, I can commit to future addresses or to people and reduce it down to a simple pubkey that I give to my payer to pay me. They don’t know the details of it so it remains private to everyone but me. Once I can confirm that they’ve paid me, all of the actions I took using the CTV template have now also taken effect.</em></p><p><em>So if I had elected to create a channel with Bob, once Alice pays me, the channel with Bob is now committed, even though the channel with Bob is nowhere to be seen on-chain, it is only accessible by my template and the transaction that Alice had created. It’s only known to me until I share the channel details with Bob. Once I do share the details with Bob, we can use the channel as normal. When we cooperatively close the channel, instead of needing to place an open channel details on-chain, we just place the closing channel on-chain. This allows us to perform transaction cut-through, reducing the total number of transactions that need to be on-chain by at least half for layer 2 solutions.</em></p><p><em>The opening portion only needs a commitment, what we really care about are the closing details. If this was a shared UTXO with multiple people, we could collaborate to close our transactions together as well, reducing the number of on-chain transactions even further.</em></p><h2>5.</h2><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>As you mentioned before, we can introduce different opcodes to implement covenants.</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>So if we re-introduced OP_CAT, I think it would allow for nearly every type of covenant possible as you can emulate any form of introspection for TXHASH. The more limited method would be to introduce opcodes representing the explicit behavior desired like with CTV, CSFS or CheckSeperateSignature. CTV is the ability to do deferred outputs. CSFS is the ability to do deferred signatures so you can defer the payment itself. They sound similar and in fact they work well together as building blocks to enable LN-Symmetry, but the commitments are happening at different levels.</em></p><p><em>TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY both enable introspection and serve the same purpose, but TEMPLATE KEY uses a single-byte mode while TXHASH uses multi-byte flags. This allows for much more powerful capabilities inside script and smart contracts, but many are concerned about the side effects it could have. TXHASH and TEMPLATE KEY are more of a CTVv2, something that would make CTV more powerful and expressive.</em></p><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>I've noticed that there doesn't seem to be a significant disagreement about whether to support the implementation of covenants. However, in comparison, there seems to be more significant divergence among people regarding which method or set of opcodes to add to implement covenants.</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>I think a large part is there’s different camps of thought. There’s a lot of the lack of understanding the intent behind each proposal as they have different goals in mind and are designed in completely different ways. </em></p><p><em>A lot of developers have only had their eye on Lightning and how it’s to evolve, they tend to favor opcodes like SH_APO since it enables LN-Symmetry. For a lot of developers that don’t particularly like Lightning due to its limitations such as Inbound Liquidity constraints or the requirement to be online, they tend to favor opcodes like OP_CAT, TXHASH as more expressive scaling solutions. The developers that prefer CTV are more neutral and are looking at it from a systems point of view, it doesn’t necessarily do any one thing perfectly but it greatly enhances everyone’s ability to do their preferred thing, whatever it may be without introducing risks that can’t be measured since it doesn’t introduce introspection.</em></p><h2>6.</h2><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>Before discussing covenants, we talked about issues related to opcodes in scripting language and the problem of limited computation leading to state transition. We already know the relationship between covenants and opcodes. Now, let's delve into the issue of state transition. I'm not sure if looking at covenants from the perspective of "state transition" is correct, but this perspective truly fascinates me. </p><p>Without covenants, the scripting language's main function is to retrieve transactions' signatures and verify them. The transaction can only be completed when the private key is correct, and there is no intermediate state. With covenants, a transaction can be completed when certain conditions are met. Moreover, a transaction can only be completed when specific conditions are satisfied (not just the correctness of the private key). Can we understand it this way: Covenants indirectly provide conditions for state transition.</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>The covenant is the template shell or the "state". Inside of it, you're going to need to make time locks and other functions to enable the desired functionality that you’re wanting, be that a vault, lightning channel or some other layer 2 solution.</em></p><p><em>So CTV allows for the state creation to occur, but you have to dynamically rebuild the state at each transition to keep it in homeostasis, we call this meta-recursive. Whereas something like SH_APO allows you to create a state and then periodically update that state, making it recursive. CTV can also create a chain of transactions that would allow you to “step-through” that state. </em></p><p><em>A good example to think about is Ark, it’s a giant smart contract, almost like a giant coinjoin and the one running the protocol creates a new state [or rounds as it’s called] every few seconds to facilitate participants to pay others as needed. Once the Ark operator is ready, they will send a transaction to the mempool to commit the current state to on-chain. These on-chain placeholders can be thought of as the “transition states.” The operator has to constantly recompute new states to present to the Ark participants and what’s sent to on-chain is the verification of that state.</em></p><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>Can we understand it this way: Covenants implement a form of smart contract based on verification rather than computation?</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>Yes. Definitely. This smart contract is just comparing a transaction to an associated sha256 hash. Block speed verification would actually increase since there’s no signature operations. </em></p><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>One direction of development for blockchains is modularity, including off-chain computation. However, Bitcoin seems naturally designed for off-chain computation, appearing behind but actually leading the way. What do you think?</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>Time is a flat circle. It’s crazy how it seems like we’ve come full circle to what’s wanted in a blockchain. Bitcoin still seems to have some modularity issues and footprint issues. I wish we had better side-chains that weren’t simply multi-sig solutions and used actual cryptographic means to secure one’s funds and allowed for Unilateral Exits. I think that would help push the boundaries on Bitcoin’s modularity. Taproot has allowed for even more off-chain computation with things such as BitVM, which would allow us to compute almost anything off-chain. But unfortunately, it can’t emulate things inside Bitcoin such as CTV so it seems we still have progress to make.</em></p><h2>7.</h2><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>What possibilities can be achieved by combining covenants with other opcodes like DLC?</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>So DLC’s have a few problems that would be fixed with covenants such as increasing the flexibility of the parameters of the DLC by making many price points [if we’re wagering on the price of something such as Bitcoin]. Another one is that hardware wallets [HWW] can’t interact with a lot of DLC’s, the signing rounds for DLCs and attempting to do it with HWWs causes DLCs to take several minutes to open. With CTV, this delay to enter a DLC can be reduced down to seconds. </em></p><h2>8.</h2><p><strong>Hua:</strong></p><p>Are there any other points you'd like to introduce to the readers?</p><p><strong>Poly:</strong></p><p><em>We went over a lot of concepts. We touched on how it can be used to mitigate excessive blockspace demand and potential ddos attacks. We discussed how people could save space by making Non-Interactive Channels. I think another good one to discuss is the "L2 exit problem". If we managed to get everyone off of the L1 layer and get them onto a large L2, there's currently no good way to get people off that L2 in an expedited manner. We could think of that L2 as Lightning [we call the potential mass exodus on Lightning, the "Thundering Herd problem”], or we could think of Coinbase, Binance or Liquid as the L2. There are people who hold claims to Bitcoin, but their only way to actually acquire that claim is by submitting a transaction to get it placed on-chain. There's millions of people on Coinbase, I have no idea how to get them off of there and onto Bitcoin in any orderly fashion in today's environment. There would be a mempool backlog of 6 months attempting to get people off the exchange. CTV can fix this. </em></p><p><em>Make an Ark or a Timeout-Tree with CTV. The exchange could even offer the service directly. Everyone could be offloaded from the original "shared UTXO" that was under Coinbase's consensus and pushed into a "shared UTXO" with a consensus of their choice, be it a simple pool or a large Timeout-Tree. This is where it really wrinkles the brain, this was a pure L2 <> L2 conversion. There was no intermediary step requiring me to go down to L1 first. And I can continue repeating this process indefinitely, using any layer of my choice. There isn’t a need to return to the base layer unless I was forced there such as from an uncooperative closeout from my channel or perhaps an unvaulting from my vault. The Ark and Timeout-Tree pitfall is that they have rollover requirements, you have to move your funds every few weeks or months or you forfeit your funds. This isn’t an ideal solution for long-term funds but works great for any short term holdings and larger markets.</em></p><p><em>I'd like to provide a full list of every concept that’s been developed using CTV and its ability to simply aggregate pre-signed transactions: Non-Interactive Channels, Timeout-Trees, Ark, Darkpools, Payment Pools, Payment Channels, Ball Lightning, Congestion Control, Dpool's, Compaction, Tree Swaps, PathCoin, Stakechains, Surfchains. But don’t think of these as all independent Templates, if there’s a feature of one that you wish to include in another, you can create your own custom Template to try and find your desired behavior. </em></p><p><em><strong>References:</strong></em></p><blockquote><p>Owen's Covenants 101 <a href="https://x.com/OwenKemeys/status/1741575353716326835">https://x.com/OwenKemeys/status/1741575353716326835</a></p><p>Owen's Covenants 102 <a href="https://x.com/OwenKemeys/status/1744181234417140076">https://x.com/OwenKemeys/status/1744181234417140076</a></p><p>Owen’s CTV Demo <a href="https://x.com/OwenKemeys/status/1752138051105493274?s=20">https://x.com/OwenKemeys/status/1752138051105493274</a> </p><p>Dallas's Primer <a href="https://x.com/dallasirushing/status/1740443095689318566">https://x.com/dallasirushing/status/1740443095689318566</a></p><p>Batching Lightning Channels Required Covenants <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/022006.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-October/022006.html</a></p><p>Timeout-Trees <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-September/021941.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-September/021941.html</a></p><p>Ark <a href="https://www.arkpill.me/">https://www.arkpill.me/</a></p><p>Darkpools <a href="https://gist.github.com/moonsettler/6a214f5d01148ea204e9131b86a35382">https://gist.github.com/moonsettler/6a214f5d01148ea204e9131b86a35382</a></p><p>PathCoin <a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/pathcoin-poc">https://github.com/AdamISZ/pathcoin-poc</a></p></blockquote><p><em>This is a guest post by Aemlie Hua.

Without this, in one way or another, you are relinquishing control of your money to someone else. “Not your keys, not your coins” as the saying goes. A counter-intuitive aspect of Bitcoin for people who aren’t familiar with the technical underpinnings of it is “where” your Bitcoin actually is. When people think of a wallet, they think “the place where I keep my money.” <a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/crypto/what-is-a-bitcoin-wallet-and-how-does-it-work">Your bitcoin wallet</a> doesn’t actually “hold” your Bitcoin, it just stores your private keys. Your Bitcoin is just entries of data on the blockchain hosted by everyone participating in the network. When you go to spend your bitcoin, what you are actually doing is proposing an update to the data stored on the blockchain. A private key is how the protocol ensures that you, and you alone, can authorize an update to the blockchain that spends your Bitcoin. </p><p>So what are your private keys? Just very large numbers. Extremely large. This is a private key in binary: </p><p><em>1110001011011001011110111100000101000100000010001001111010111011010101110111001111111111101010111010010111010011101001110010100110111101000110000111110101111001101001011110011011101000001101101101110001101000110001111010001001001111011010101011001101101010</em></p><p>256 random 1s and 0s. This random number is what ultimately secures your Bitcoin. It might not look like much, but its randomness is what ensures your wallet’s security. There are almost as many possible Bitcoin private keys as there are atoms in the visible universe. That is how many numbers a computer would have to count through to generate and catalog all the private keys potentially possible. As long as the process used to generate the keys is truly random, your keys are safe. </p><p>This is what a private key looks like in hexadecimal (binary uses two digits to encode a number, 1 and 0, hexadecimal uses 16 digits, 0-9 and A-F): </p><p><em>E2D97BC144089EBB5773FFABA5D3A729BD187D79A5E6E836DC68C7A24F6AB36A</em></p><p>This is what a private key looks like in uncompressed Wallet Import Format (WIF): </p><p><em>5KYC9aMMSDWGJciYRtwY3mNpeTn91BLagdjzJ4k4RQmdhQvE98G</em></p><p>WIF format is how everyone used to interact with their private keys in the early days of Bitcoin. In this era, you could generate one private key at a time, and then you’d generate the public key from that. The process of generating a public key is essentially just the multiplication of very large numbers but there is a bit more to it than that.. All public keys are an x and y point on a graph showing a very, <em>very</em> large curve that loops back on itself. </p><p>On the graph curve, in Bitcoin’s case <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1">Secp256k1</a>, there is a point called the “generator point.” This generator point can be thought of as the “base point” on the Secp256k1 curve. It is integral to the process of generating keys and signing with them. This is what the generator point is for Bitcoin’s curve: </p><p><em>G = 02 79BE667E F9DCBBAC 55A06295 CE870B07 029BFCDB 2DCE28D9 59F2815B 16F81798</em></p><p>To generate the public key from your private key, you take the private key you generated and multiply it by the generator point. That’s it. This now establishes a point on the graph with a mathematical relationship to the private key you generated that only you know. </p><p>This is an uncompressed public key showing both x and y points: </p><p><em>04C0E410A572C880D1A2106AFE1C6EA2F67830ABCC8BBDF24729F7BF3AFEA06158F0C04D7335D051A92442330A50B8C37CE0EC5AFC4FFEAB41732DA5108261FFED</em></p><p>It is very common to “compress” public keys in the rare chance you interact with them to just store the x coordinate with a byte to tell you whether the y coordinate is negative or positive. That shortens it considerably: </p><p><em>04C0E410A572C880D1A2106AFE1C6EA2F67830ABCC8BBDF24729F7BF3AFEA06158F0C04D7335D051A92442330A50B8C37CE0EC5AFC4FFEAB41732DA5108261FFED</em></p><p>When you go to sign a transaction with your private key, it once again boils down to essentially just multiplication. By generating a random number (the nonce), and using that and your private key to essentially multiply the hash of the transaction you are signing, you produce the signature (which is made up of two values, r, and S). This allows someone to run an algorithm to verify the message was signed by the appropriate private key without revealing that key. The thing guaranteeing only you can authorize spending your Bitcoin is essentially just the multiplication of very, very large numbers. </p><p>If you aren’t all that familiar with these concepts before reading this, all of this probably seems somewhat intimidating. Binary? Hexadecimal? Graph points? How do you back up a WIF? </p><p>Since the development of more intuitive ways of handling this data, most users are unfamiliar with these complicated formats. Most likely, you have more experience with word seeds, also known as seed phrases.</p><h2>BIP 39 Mnemonic Seeds</h2><p>Mnemonic seeds, or seed phrases, were created to address the problem of the experience of interacting with your private keys.</p><p>As we discussed earlier, private keys are ultimately just a long series of 1s and 0s that are randomly generated. Imagine trying to create copies of this and ensure you didn’t make an error transcribing it:</p><p><em>1110001011011001011110111100000101000100000010001001111010111011010101110111001111111111101010111010010111010011101001110010100110111101000110000111110101111001101001011110011011101000001101101101110001101000110001111010001001001111011010101011001101101010</em></p><p>All it would take is a single error copying one digit to render a backup of your keys useless. This is where mnemonic seeds come in handy. 256 consecutive 1s and 0s in a row is not a human-friendly way to interact with sensitive information. Recording this number incorrectly means losing access to your account.</p><p><em>truck renew fury donkey remind laptop reform detail split grief because fat</em></p><p>That is much easier to deal with, isn’t it? Just 12 words. So how does that work, going from a bunch of random 1s and 0s to a string of words that actually make sense to you? An encoding scheme, just like binary or hexadecimal!</p><p>Each of those 12 words in that mnemonic seed above is a binary number in an <em>encoding scheme</em> mapping specific strings of 1s and 0s to words. If we look back at the WIF private key example earlier, that was simply a number encoded in a specific encoding scheme, in that case, base 58, which uses every number and letter of the alphabet except 0 and 1, and O and l (case sensitive). The exclusion of those characters was done specifically to make transcription errors unlikely by confusing a 1 for an l, or a 0 for an O. bech32 and bech32m used by Segwit and Taproot take this to the next level by using only this set of characters (qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l). </p><p>Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 (BIP 39), introduced a standardized encoding scheme where each word in a specially crafted dictionary is alphabetically mapped to a binary number from 00000000001 to 11111111111. The demonstration seed above maps to this: </p><p>truck: 11101001001</p><p>renew: 10110110001</p><p>fury: 01011110011</p><p>donkey: 01000001001</p><p>remind: 10110101110</p><p>laptop: 01111101000</p><p>reform: 10110100010</p><p>detail: 00111100010</p><p>split: 11010010001</p><p>grief: 01100110100</p><p>because: 00010011110</p><p>fat: 01010011011</p><p>In just binary it looks like this:</p><p>11101001001 10110110001 01011110011 01000001001 10110101110 01111101000 10110100010 00111100010 11010010001 01100110100 00010011110 0101001 1011</p><p>There are 2048 words, each mapped to a specific 11 digit string of 1s and 0s, specifically to make it easier for people to interact with their private keys. When you generate a random number for your private key, your wallet cuts that number up into chunks of 11 digit binary numbers and maps them to the BIP 39 Mnemonic dictionary. It’s still the same large number, but now you can read it as English words. Since your brain is much more accustomed to this format than long strings of 1s and 0s, this <em>drastically</em> reduces the odds of you writing down something wrong and losing your Bitcoin in the process. </p><p>You may have noticed that in the raw binary encoding of the word seed above, there are four digits (1011) sitting off on their own, and the last “word” is only actually 8 digits. That is a checksum to ensure that a seed phrase is valid. When you generate your random number, there aren’t enough digits to map it exactly to 12 (or 24) words. The wallet hashes those existing digits you generated and takes the first few digits of the hash to add on to the end of your random number. This gives you enough digits to map to the last word. </p><p>This last word allows you to perform a safety check on copies of your seed. If you enter your mnemonic seed into a wallet incorrectly, the checksum will not match. Each 12 or 24 word seed has multiple potential valid checksum words, but if the last word doesn’t match the checksum of a correct seed your wallet will warn you it is invalid. This gives people an intuitive yet still mathematical way to guarantee their backups are correct, unlike the messy process of transcribing and backing up the raw binary numbers. </p><p>The selection of the specific words on the list even went so far as to guarantee that none of the 2048 words have the same first four letters. This was done to reduce the likelihood of people making transcription errors by confusing similar words and winding up with an incorrect backup of their private keys. </p><p>Translating these words into a <em>set</em> of multiple private/public keys is quite simple. Your mnemonic seed is taken and hashed using SHA512, which outputs a hash of 512 individual 1s and 0s. Half of that output is used as an actual private key, and the other half is used as input to SHA512 with an index number and the existing private or public key to generate a new key pair. You can do this as many times as you want to generate new private/public keys that can all be recovered from your single mnemonic phrase. </p><p>This ensures that you can manage your private keys as easily, and <em>safely</em>, as possible with the lowest odds of making a mistake that loses your money. And all of it was done using math! Hopefully, now you have a good understanding of why people say that Bitcoin is money ‘secured by math.’</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODc2NjQ4NDg5NzU1OTk0/ledger-10-steps---seed-words---article-preview.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODc2NjQ4NDg5NzU1OTk0/ledger-10-steps---seed-words---article-preview.png"><media:title>ledger-10-steps---seed-words---article-preview</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Perils of Centralized Control]]></title><description><![CDATA[Centralized forces exerting influence over the masses is the greatest threat to any decentralized system or activity.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-perils-of-centralized-control</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-perils-of-centralized-control</guid><category><![CDATA[Defense Distributed]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cody Wilson]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kudzai Kutukwa]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 18:17:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODU2NTAzNDgyNDU5NzQy/default_a_centralized_authority_controlling_people_1.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><em>“It is in the nature of a system of government control of business to aim at the utmost centralization…In voting for government control of business the voters implicitly, although unwittingly, are voting for more centralization.”</em></p><p>- Ludwig Von Mises</p></blockquote><p>One of the most underestimated threats that modern society faces is the ever tightening grip of centralized control. History has shown us time and again that centralized control inevitably devolves into tyranny, eroding the foundations of liberty upon which free societies are built.<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm"> The 10 planks of communism</a>, as outlined by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf">The Communist Manifesto,</a> that serves as the blueprint for transitioning society to a collectivist system cannot be implemented without centralization first occurring; due to the fact that communism at its core seeks to abolish every form of private ownership while enthroning the state as master of all. The sad reality is that these planks have been gradually implemented over the years by most countries in the world, thus progressively eroding free markets and the overall liberty of their citizens.</p><p>The centralization of speech online is the most recent threat that has emerged as a potent tool for state control. Ironically, this phenomenon resembles the realization of plank 6 of the communist manifesto, which advocates for the<em> "centralization of the</em><em> Means of Communication</em><em> and Transport in the Hands of the State." </em>As commerce and communications via online platforms grows, these two very important aspects of human existence become centralized in the hands of the big tech companies that own these platforms. In our cancel culture driven world, the increasing overlap between centralized social media platforms and financial services has significantly increased the risk of absolute censorship; where violating the constantly changing "community guidelines" can lead to one becoming persona non grata and being immediately deplatformed.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Without decentralized alternatives, censoring any speech or transaction that is deemed “undesirable” becomes a trivial matter. Big tech social media giants acting as the de facto thought police and enforcers for the state, wield immense influence over the flow of information, and suppress every form of dissent through the threat of financial strangulation when one doesn’t toe the line.<em> </em>There are two major factors that undergird this power to silence dissent online:</p><ul><li>Centralized nature of the social media platforms </li><li>Centralized payment processors like PayPal that dominate these platforms </li></ul><p>For individuals who rely on social media for their livelihood, deplatforming represents a significant threat, not only to their ability to express themselves freely but also to their income. Self-censorship naturally becomes the norm and this is even more dangerous as it creates the illusion of alignment with the current thing of the day. Thankfully, Bitcoin has made these payment processors irrelevant and due to it being fully decentralized, neutral, apolitical and censorship resistant; it’s a viable alternative. </p><h2>Code is Speech</h2><p>In 2013 Cody Wilson, the pioneer of the world's first 3-D printable gun, <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/printable-gun-instructions-spread-online-after-state-dept-orders-their-removal/?version=meter+at+null&module=meter-Links&pgtype=article&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click">received a letter</a> from the State Department demanding removal of blueprints for his plastic firearm, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberator_(gun)">the Liberator</a>, or risk facing jail time and millions in fines. In 2015 Wilson's organization, <a href="https://defdist.org/">Defense Distributed,</a> filed a lawsuit against the State Department, alleging that prohibiting the publication of his plans, which are essentially computer code, constitutes a prior restraint of free speech rights, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US constitution. The dispute revolved around the State Department’s claim that posting 3-D printable gun files online constitutes a potential breach of arms export controls, a controversial set of regulations known as <a href="https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&sys_id=24d528fddbfc930044f9ff621f961987">the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)</a>. </p><p>The history of ITAR has been marred by controversy and contention. In the 90s, it was used to target cryptographers (aka cypherpunks), classifying strong encryption tools as military munitions. After the source code for <a href="https://www.philzimmermann.com/EN/essays/WhyIWrotePGP.html">PGP</a> was released and printed out as a book, it immediately fell under First Amendment protection. Despite this seemingly obvious fact, its inventor Phil Zimmermann, was subjected to a grueling three-year Department Of Justice (DOJ) investigation during these <a href="https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/">Crypto Wars</a>, which was subsequently put to bed without any indictments. In 1995 cryptographer Dan Bernstein also sued the DOJ, arguing ITAR violated his First Amendment rights, and won the case. This was the landmark case that designated <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/bernstein-v-us-dept-justice">code as speech</a>. </p><p>Despite the State Department's two-year enforcement of ITAR against Defense Distributed, it failed to stop the proliferation of its 3-D printable gun files online. Instead, concerns over censorship spurred over <a href="https://archive.is/o/LeqEi/https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/05/08/3d-printed-guns-blueprints-downloaded-100000-times-in-two-days-with-some-help-from-kim-dotcom/">100,000 downloads of the Liberator blueprint</a> in just two days! Despite removal from Defense Distributed’s websites, the file quickly spread to platforms like the Pirate Bay, making erasure nearly impossible. Attempts to ban speech in the digital age are not only absurd but futile because of its ability to manifest in infinite forms.The historical example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA's</a> classification as munition highlights the futility of restricting information as epitomized by printing forbidden information on t-shirts. Information must be free. </p><figure>

                    <p>In an interview I had with <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicasolce">Jessica Solce</a>, the film maker and executive producer of <a href="https://www.deathathletic.com/"><em>Death Athletic: A Dissident Architecture</em></a> a documentary that profiled Cody Wilson and the 3D-printed guns movement; when commenting on the significance of Cody’s battle with the government she said,</p><p>“<em>Cody entangled the First and Second Amendment by pushing guns into the digital era. He utilized the burgeoning technology of 3D printing to reduce a gun to code. This WikiWeapon, the Liberator, was directly inspired by Wikileaks, and immediately threatened the Government’s axis of power and control. It was a masterful play that antagonized the military complex and forced the conversation of gun control into the age of the Internet.”</em></p><p>In other words, Wilson didn’t just challenge the military industrial complex’s monopolization (i.e., centralization) of firearms manufacturing. His stance extended to firmly resisting instances of government overreach that sought to regulate and control information pertaining to emerging technologies, which in and of itself is another form of centralized control. A condition which George Orwell described in his book 1984 as, “<em>an endless present in which the party is always right”. </em></p><p>Interestingly Jessica also encountered firm resistance from centralized content distributors and media outlets when the film was released, as it definitely didn’t fit the “approved narrative” because on the surface it looks like a film about guns but it’s really a story about the power of free speech and free access to information in the internet age.<em> </em>Clearly the time is ripe for more decentralized content distribution and streaming services that are integrated with Bitcoin payments, think <a href="https://www.angel.com/">Angel Studios</a> on a Bitcoin standard. This will empower content creators to not only profit from captivating content while simultaneously challenging centralized control over information, ensuring artistic creative control, prioritizing truth, and preservation of free speech., but I digress.</p><p>In July 2018, three years after Defense Distributed challenged the State Department’s actions in court, they accepted a<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4600187-Defense-Distributed-Settlement-Agreement.html"> settlement offer</a> from the State Department, including a license to publish its files and a payment of nearly $40,000. When questioned about the settlement, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/31/3-d-printable-guns-donald-trump/870557002/">justified the decision</a>, stating that the Department of Justice advised settling the case to avoid likely loss on First Amendment grounds in court. Information must be free.</p><p>This and many other ongoing legal battles faced by Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed underscore important aspects of individual rights and freedom of speech that must be defended. These battles serve as a reminder that:</p><ol><li>The state seeks to control and capture new technologies by “any means necessary” </li><li>Lawfare and bureaucracy are the weapons of choice in achieving this aim </li><li>More decentralized technological tools and protocols that incorporate Bitcoin as the monetary layer need to be built to ensure the preservation of liberty and individual sovereignty. </li></ol><p>Jessica echoed similar sentiments when stating one of the biggest takeaways that she hopes people will get from Cody’s story; “<em>The takeaway is to build however you can - community, resources, decentralized systems, archive history and information. The battle for information, the era of the Internet and the battle for its control must be understood as a type of new frontier. Many are against </em><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-2/"><em>second amendment rights</em></a><em> so I’d ask them are they truly against the free and open dissemination of information as well? Do they like someone telling them what they are able and not able to understand and read?” </em></p><p>I couldn’t agree more.</p><h2>Decoding Free Speech in the Digital Age</h2><p>Just like PGP or Cody’s 3D-printable gun designs, Bitcoin at its core is fundamentally open source code, thus Bitcoin is speech. In <a href="https://archive.ph/yAOwZ#selection-1319.220-1331.15">the words</a> of Beautyon,<em>“There is no point in any Bitcoin transaction that Bitcoin ceases to be text. It is all text, all the time.</em>” <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2008/04/21-40">The ruling</a> in the Bernstein v. The DOJ case set a precedent that recognized code as protected speech under the First Amendment, and therefore this protection also directly applies to Bitcoin. Fundamentally, Bitcoin is a messaging system and functions much like email and text messaging, all of which transmit messages. Its primary aim is to definitively confirm an owner's control over a cryptographic key, represented as a block of text, enabling access to a corresponding entry in the global Bitcoin network ledger. The point here is that restriction of communication using programming languages is an example of a prior restraint of speech. </p><figure>

                    <p>Attempts to ban Bitcoin are just as ludicrous as banning memorizing 12 words in your head or outlawing<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2653838863893184007"> certain musical scores </a>.Does this mean that the powers that be will not try to outlaw Bitcoin and increase their grip on the narrative through censorship? You bet they will! Just like they have declared war on free speech online by rebranding it as a war on<a href="https://youtu.be/q_4Cjki3SOM?si=BybFrgsFt5JVs6Xs&t=820"> “misinformation and disinformation”</a>, propaganda is also being disseminated by the corporate media that paints Bitcoin mining in particular, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/mining-misinformation-how-the-united-nations-university-misrepresented-data-to-exaggerate-bitcoins-environmental-footprint">as being harmful to the environment</a>, a claim that has been repeatedly debunked along with the usual “<a href="https://x.com/YahooFinance/status/1732445529777271268?s=20">Bitcoin is for money launderers and criminals</a>” </p><p>Time fails me to discuss the latest proposed <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/bitcoin-anti-totalitarianism">FinCen regulations</a> and the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">(MiCA)</a> law which are all very subtle but sinister attempts to gradually cripple Bitcoin in the name of combating money laundering and enforcing know your customer policies.. In the same vein, digital ID’s and central bank digital currencies (CBDC’s), are more than just surveillance tech; but are also weapons for destroying free speech and independent thought. The ultimate road to serfdom. While legal challenges against all these forms of government overreach noted above will be launched and likely won, they take a long time to settle and are usually very costly. The best solution is to develop more open-source, decentralized technological tools that will thwart and defang any attempts by the state to censor speech.</p><p> As big tech companies pay lip service to freedom of speech while simultaneously implementing <a href="https://x.com/lindayaX/status/1681656761101479936?s=20"><em>“freedom of speech not reach</em></a> policies, online discourse increasingly mirrors the authoritarian control described by Ludwig von Mises <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Bureaucracy_3.pdf">when he said</a>: “<em>At every instant of his life the "comrade" is bound to obey implicitly the orders issued by the supreme authority. The State is both his guardian and his employer. The State determines his work, his diet, and his pleasures. The State tells him what to think and what to believe in”. </em>This is even more true today, than it was in 1944 when it was written. </p><p>Without the freedom of speech we lose a critical part of what it means to be free human beings. Today we may witness the battles between Defense Distributed and the State Department, Wikileaks and the DOJ, Bernstein and the DOJ, and so on. However, one thing remains clear: the players may change, and the time frames may differ, but the underlying struggle has always been centralization versus decentralization, a battle between those who seek to control speech and those who seek to liberate it. Satoshi Nakamoto, Julian Assange, Aaron Schwartz and many others are some of the martyrs of freedom that contributed immensely to the preservation of free speech in our society today.

So nostalgia is the suffering caused by an unappeased yearning to return.”</em></p><p>― Milan Kundera, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3424606"><em>Ignorance</em></a></p></blockquote><figure>

                    <p>Nostalgia is a powerful emotion. A coping mechanism, an inspiration, or a manipulative rhetorical tool. For quite some time, the inhabitants of the West have found themselves conscripted onto a battlefield of the mind. Society has been reshaping itself or being reshaped at a frenetic pace for decades now. Nostalgia has proven itself to be a potent weapon in the arsenals of every faction on that battlefield.</p><p>The power of contrast should never be underestimated. Humans are living, breathing, pattern-recognition machines. We cannot help but compare proposed plans and present circumstances to historical outcomes. This is normal, this is healthy: It lets the human mind achieve some measure of confidence in predicting what happens next. The human mind loathes unpredictability more than anything else. The unknown noise in the dark is far more terrifying than the wild animal on the ridgeline that you can observe and predict.</p><p>The regime knows that contrast holds such power, because it allows for critique. Such was the power of Florida during COVID, for instance. Without a state that was free of lockdowns and mandates, foisting the same circumstances on an entire population across the board would have caused less negative sentiment of those measures. This was the real reason for the mass psychosis and peer pressure of that era. It’s much more difficult to make someone take a bite of a turd sandwich insistently offered to them when there are other options.</p><figure>

                    <blockquote><p><em>“The past is a candle at great distance: too close to let you quit, too far to comfort you.”</em></p><p>― Amy Bloom, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3286459"><em>Away</em></a></p></blockquote><p>“Hireath” is an old Welsh word that describes a feeling of homesickness for something that no longer exists or perhaps never did. Millennials stand astride the old world before 9/11 and the new one, with memories of a higher-trust society with much more prosperity and unity than what we have now. These feelings are amplified by the fact that due to their age, the entirety of the era before the shift was viewed through the rose-colored glasses of childhood. Essentially, millennials are too young to remember the 1992 L.A. riots or the Oklahoma City bombing with any sense of clarity or context, but old enough to remember when innocence was valued and optimism about the future was commonplace.</p><p>This contrast between a less anxious past and a present that consists of never-ending psychological warfare can be many things. The past can be pointed to as a critique of how far we have fallen and thrown in the faces of the ruling order as dissent. It can also be a coping mechanism, both healthy and unhealthy. From vaporwave to homesteading, from filtered edits of 1980s Miami to thinking about the Roman empire, the aesthetics and contrast of the past are coming back with a vengeance as the present is too Lovecraftian to personify.</p><p>My personal favorite example of this has been the meteoric resurgence of the band Creed. While the band broke up in 2004, they have miraculously been memed back to life. A video of the 2001 Thanksgiving halftime show they performed in Dallas went viral. Taking place just two months after 9/11, that snapshot in time captured and distilled both the optimism of the time and the resilience of its people. The video entered the narrative bloodstream, provoking remarks about how “we used to be a real country” and with it, the demand that we deserve something better than this because we once had something better than this.</p><p>Shortly afterwards the Texas Rangers began to streak toward the World Series after a rough start. The team gave the credit for their comeback to Creed, which they began to play constantly in the locker room for motivation. Home games in Dallas blared “Higher” and “My Sacrifice” prompting the fans to sing along in a massive chorus. The Rangers would go on to win the World Series, with a reunited Creed attending the game with Jerseys and a newly announced tour across the United States. The winner of this season of The Voice was a burly white guy belting out Creed’s “Higher” during his finale. In a dark time of “Its So Over” lies the burning embers of a “We Are So Back”.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Every act of rebellion expresses a nostalgia for innocence and an appeal to the essence of being.”</em></p><p>― Albert Camus, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/486408"><em>The Rebel</em></a></p></blockquote><figure>

                    <p>But the regime understands the power of contrast, too. The solution to this problem has been to tear down or change the past. Beloved franchises that influence culture are butchered ignobly by the likes of Kathleen Kennedy. Films and shows of historical fiction are made to impose contemporary norms of sex, diversity, and sarcastic cynicism upon our past. Suddenly there have always been black Scandinavians, African Roman legionnaires in Britain, and the great men of history have their conquests and achievements “reimagined” to give someone else the credit. Wikipedia is edited, and classical literature and its heroes are “reimagined” and judged through a contemporary lens.</p><p>Visual media is obviously the most powerful avenue with which to do this. A series like <em>Stranger Things</em> seeks to recreate the most familiar possible representation of the 1980s, only to subtly slip in the values the regime wishes to promote as if this state of affairs has always been the norm. <em>Yellowstone</em> receives critical acclaim only for tough cowboys and patriarchal dynasties to spend spare moments reinforcing that a good feller ought to be a feminist. Like an angler fish with a pretty lure and a poisonous bite, designed to entertain you just enough to where the subversion can slip through.</p><p>This adds a certain sense of urgency to stopping the rot. It is why we must promote and share the best parts of our past, even if it’s something like a halftime show played by Creed. Those of us who remember the time before the world moved on must pass down what was normal and what was good to the generations born inside the throes of hell world who don’t know any better. It is our duty to shout from the rooftops that this isn’t the best we can do, and it’s not the best we’ve ever done. Even if the past must stay in the past, it provides a blueprint for the right kind of future.</p><p><strong><em>This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s</em> <em>“The Inscription Issue”.

<p>The move comes amidst the backdrop of growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, particularly following the recent approval of several Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Bitcoin, which continues to assert itself as a resilient asset class, is expanding its use cases beyond peer-to-peer payments to encompass store-of-value functions and serve as a foundation for innovation in areas like NFTs and DeFi, Brave stated in the announcement.</p><p>“Our aim with Brave Wallet is to offer the most secure and privacy-considerate software wallet for everyday use,” said James Mudgett, VP Web3 Products at Brave. “As the Bitcoin ecosystem expands with new apps and services, Brave Wallet will be there to put security and privacy first, to help keep users’ assets safe.”</p><p>Looking ahead, Brave says it has plans to introduce more features to enhance privacy within Brave Wallet. Moreover, the company intends to enable users to store BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals within Brave Wallet, with these features expected to be available across all desktop and mobile versions of the browser later this year.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODM2Mjk5MTUwOTkyOTkw/ghw9qf7w8aavdr9.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODM2Mjk5MTUwOTkyOTkw/ghw9qf7w8aavdr9.jpg"><media:title>ghw9qf7w8aavdr9</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Policymakers, Bitcoin Industry Leaders to Meet in Washington D.C. at Bitcoin Policy Summit ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Politicians, policymakers and Bitcoin industry leaders are meeting in Washington D.C. for the second annual Bitcoin Policy summit to explore the implications of Bitcoin and digital assets on federal policy.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/policymakers-bitcoin-industry-leaders-to-meet-in-washington-d-c-at-bitcoin-policy-summit-</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/policymakers-bitcoin-industry-leaders-to-meet-in-washington-d-c-at-bitcoin-policy-summit-</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Policy Institute]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Events & Conferences 2024]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Policy Summit]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bitcoin Magazine]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODMzMTU4OTkzMDI4NDQy/bitcoin-policy-summit-2024---article-preview.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading Bitcoin advocates and key politicians will convene at the National Press Club Ballroom in Washington D.C. for the second annual Bitcoin Policy summit hosted by the Bitcoin Policy Institute. The bipartisan policy event will address the increasing integration of Bitcoin and digital assets into the political landscape of the United States while identifying important policy measures that interact with this burgeoning ecosystem.</p><p>The upcoming summit on April 9, 2024 will bring together key players in the Bitcoin ecosystem covering a diverse range of subjects including: energy and the environment, national security, perspectives on Bitcoin and democracy, and how to counter the rise of digital authoritarianism. Confirmed speakers include Avik Roy (President, Foundation for Research On Equal Opportunity), Mike Brock (CEO of Block’s TBD), Sarah Kreps (Director, Cornell Brooks Tech Policy Institute) and Matthew Pines (Director, Security Advisory at Sentinel One). The full speaker list can be viewed <a href="https://www.btcpolicysummit.org/2024-speakers">here</a>. Further speakers will be announced prior to the event according to Bitcoin Policy Institute representatives.</p><p> At the inaugural Bitcoin Policy Summit on April 26, 2023, policymakers including US Senator Ted Cruz, US Senator Cynthia Lummis and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer met with Bitcoin industry representatives to discuss the importance of Bitcoin from a national and economic security perspective, as well as the importance of Bitcoin in the context of human rights. Notable Bitcoin industry representatives included Alex Gladstein (Chief Strategy Officer, Human Rights Foundation), Jack Mallers (Strike CEO), and Roya Mahboob (CEO and Co-Founder, Digital Citizen Fund).</p><p> During the 2023 summit, Senator Ted Cruz made headlines when <a href="https://x.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1651278737256718336?s=20">revealing</a> that he was: “incredibly bullish on Bitcoin <em>specifically</em>”, perhaps indicating his preference for Bitcoin over alternative digital assets. He also remarked: "I own a little more than 2 bitcoin, and every Monday I own a little bit more. I bought the dip." With bitcoin trading at approximately $28,000 per coin at the time of his statement in 2023, Cruz’s bullishness appears to have been well-founded.</p><p> This year’s Bitcoin Policy Summit will be livestreamed to viewers in partnership with Bitcoin Magazine, bringing live footage to viewers across social media including Twitter (X) and YouTube.

                    <p>With the potential to harness an estimated <a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/ethiopia-energy">60 GW</a> of hydropower, geothermal, wind, and solar, Ethiopia stands as a powerhouse that could theoretically become capable of generating more than <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci?pStoreID=epp">three times</a> the electricity consumed by the entire bitcoin mining network. Presently, the nation has tapped into a fraction of this potential, having an electricity generation capacity of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">5.3 GW</a>.</p><p>Assuming a capacity factor of 40%, Ethiopia's current electricity generation capacity translates to a potential of 18.6 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year under normal rainfall conditions. Comparatively, in 2022, the country's electricity consumption amounted to only <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy/country/ethiopia">14.7 TWh</a>, leaving approximately 20% of the electricity generation potential unutilized. This number will be even higher during particularly wet years.</p><p>As if Ethiopia's electricity surplus wasn't already substantial, the nation is on the brink of nearly doubling its generation capacity with the commissioning of The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. This awe-inspiring project will claim the title of Africa's largest hydropower plant, boasting an impressive nameplate capacity of <a href="https://www.mowe.gov.et/en/project/grand-ethiopian-renaissance-dam-1">6.5 GW</a>.</p><p>With an anticipated capacity factor of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200403235717/https://www.internationalrivers.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/international_panel_of_experts_for_ethiopian_renaissance_dam-_final_report_1.pdf">29%</a>, sustained by the continuous influx of water to the dam, the power plant is projected to yield approximately 16.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually. This output is equal to <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci?pStoreID=epp">10%</a> of the consumption of the Bitcoin mining network, underscoring Ethiopia's potential to become a dominant force in both energy production and bitcoin mining.</p><figure>

                    <p>The forthcoming Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam's anticipated 16.5 TWh of electricity production will propel Ethiopia's total potential generation to a staggering 35.1 TWh annually under typical rainfall conditions. With current consumption at 14.7 TWh, the surplus electricity generation will amount to an impressive 20.4 TWh, corresponding to a percentage electricity surplus of 58%.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Ethiopia is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and is set to see a surge in electricity demand, necessitating the expansion of its hydropower infrastructure. However, the non-modular nature of hydropower plants often leads to overbuilt capacity, resulting in surplus generation until demand catches up.</p><p>The flexibility inherent in bitcoin mining makes it the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/five-factors-making-bitcoin-miners-unique">perfect match</a> for Ethiopia's surplus electricity, offering a means to monetize until residential, commercial, and industrial consumption catches up. Once demand increases, miners can adapt by relocating or contributing to the financing of new power plants.</p><p>Without Bitcoin mining, Ethiopia faces the prospect of significant electricity wastage until demand aligns. By seizing the opportunity to leverage its abundant energy resources, Ethiopia positions itself for sustained economic growth, with initiatives like Bitcoin mining serving as a catalyst for optimizing resource utilization and driving prosperity.</p><h2>Bitcoin mining increases Ethiopia’s exports and access to foreign currency</h2><p>Ethiopia grapples with a daunting challenge: a staggering trade deficit. With more dollars flowing out than in, the nation faces mounting difficulties in importing vital goods and services. Compounded by a struggling currency, ironically named the Birr, Ethiopia's citizens are vulnerable to soaring inflation rates.</p><p>In 2022, Ethiopia imported $23 billion worth of products and services while exporting just $11 billion, leaving a cavernous trade deficit of $12 billion. This deficit is straining the nation's ability to meet debt obligations, showcased by the ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a potential bailout.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODMyMzQzMjE3Njc3OTE4/image5.png" height="800" width="1110">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Luckily, Ethiopia's abundant electricity surplus presents a promising opportunity for foreign currency generation through exports. However, traditional avenues like selling electricity to neighboring countries have been limited due to low demand and weak economies in the region, yielding modest returns of around $70 million annually.</p><p>Enter Bitcoin mining, a revolutionary solution that transcends geographical constraints by allowing electricity to be converted directly into digital currency. With minimal investment in transmission infrastructure, Ethiopia can tap into the global Bitcoin network as a lucrative consumer of its surplus energy.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>By embracing Bitcoin mining, Ethiopia diversifies its export income and reduces reliance on neighboring countries for electricity sales. With the ability to export electricity through the Internet, the nation gains a stronger negotiating position and can demand higher prices for its exported power.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">Bloomberg</a>, Yodahe A. Zemichael of the Information Network Security Administration (INSA) highlighted the government's motivation of legalizing the bitcoin mining industry, citing that companies pay in foreign currency for the electricity they consume in data center operations.</p><p>Considering the official bitcoin mining tariff of $0.0314/kWh, Ethiopia stands to generate a substantial export income of $640 million if it sells all its excess electricity to Bitcoin miners. Furthermore, by self-mining with the most efficient machines available, the country could potentially yield an export income of $3.9 billion, making Bitcoin mining a transformative force in Ethiopia's economy and potentially its largest export industry. This tantalizing prospect underscores the transformative potential of Bitcoin mining for Ethiopia's economic landscape.</p><p>Indeed, it's prudent to adjust our expectations to account for real-world factors such as the Bitcoin halving and Ethiopia's likely utilization of a portion of its electricity surplus for other purposes. A more realistic estimate of Ethiopia's export income from Bitcoin mining would likely fall somewhere between $640 million and $3.9 billion, settling in the middle at around $2.3 billion.This figure still positions Bitcoin mining as the largest export industry in Ethiopia, representing a significant economic opportunity for the nation.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODMyNDI3NTA2NDExMTAy/image6.png" height="800" width="1109">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>A $2.3 billion boost in export income would indeed wield transformative power for the Ethiopian economy, providing a vital injection of foreign currency to strengthen the national currency and facilitate easier access to essential imports. Moreover, reducing dependency on foreign lenders would enhance Ethiopia's sovereignty and bolster its economic resilience.</p><p>At this pivotal moment, Ethiopia faces the imperative of addressing its trade imbalance and charting a course for economic prosperity. Embracing bitcoin mining as a means to export surplus electricity through the internet offers a groundbreaking opportunity to unlock Ethiopia's economic potential.</p><p>Indeed, it could represent the greatest economic opportunity of this generation for the country.</p><h2>Bitcoin miners can build out electrical infrastructure in Ethiopia</h2><p>The challenge of electrification in Ethiopia is stark: only <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.ZS?locations=ET">54%</a> of the population currently has access to electricity, with rural areas significantly lagging behind urban centers. While cities boast a <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.UR.ZS?locations=ET">94%</a> electrification rate, rural areas struggle at just <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.ACCS.RU.ZS?locations=ET">43%</a>. The Ethiopian Government has set an ambitious goal of achieving near-universal electrification by 2030, but this endeavor faces significant hurdles.</p><p>The electrification challenge in Ethiopia, particularly in rural areas, underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions. While the country boasts significant electricity generation capacity, the main hurdle lies in transmitting and distributing this energy to remote communities.</p><p>Bitcoin miners offer a potential solution by financing and constructing substations in rural areas with surplus electricity, such as those near The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. These substations could serve not only miners but also nearby residents, potentially providing electricity to entire towns.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODMyNDM1ODI3OTA5OTc4/image1.jpg" height="753" width="1200">
                        <figcaption><em>A substation in Africa</em></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>This approach, akin to efforts by <a href="https://gridlesscompute.com/">Gridless</a> in Kenya, could complement Ethiopia's goal of near-universal electrification by 2030. Unlike in Kenya, where Gridless focuses on building power plants with bitcoin mining as an anchor customer, Ethiopia already has sufficient power plants. Thus, Ethiopian miners could focus on building out substations to improve the population’s access to electricity.</p><p>Moreover, the increased revenue from selling electricity to miners could enable Ethiopia to invest in new electrical infrastructure, including substations, transmission lines, and distribution networks. As a result, bitcoin miners could indirectly finance the expansion of electrical infrastructure in Ethiopia, contributing to electrification for Ethiopians and fostering socio-economic development nationwide.</p><h2>Bitcoin mining brings tech jobs to Ethiopia</h2><p>Ethiopia, boasting the second-largest population in Africa with 122 million inhabitants, predominantly comprises a youthful demographic. Regrettably, the nation faces a significant challenge of high unemployment rates among its youth.</p><p>Introducing the bitcoin mining industry could potentially provide avenues for accessing tech jobs, not limited to mining facilities but also encompassing the broader bitcoin economy poised to develop alongside the foundational growth of the bitcoin mining industry.</p><p>Bitcoin mining will bring a significant amount of jobs to Ethiopians across many talents and skills. On this, Advisor at <a href="https://www.hashlabsmining.io/ethiopia">Hashlabs Mining Ethiopia</a>, Kal Kassa says:</p><blockquote><p><em>“500 jobs per bitcoin miner is a high goal to meet and I doubt this rumor we’ve been hearing is an honest reflection of the government’s intent to regulate and add thresholds to investment. That being said, facilities with investment over $100 million are very likely to require more than 500 personnel, contractors, vendors, and local suppliers. In fact, we see more than double that in interest from technicians and electrical engineers. Training and certifying skilled talent will be a pillar of our objectives in Ethiopia and I have no doubt we will inspire a generation forward.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.hashlabsmining.io/">Hashlabs Mining</a> has sponsored the onboarding of hundreds of wallets at ALX Ethiopia, DevFest’24, and the Information Network Security Administration (INSA) in keeping with this vision.</p><figure>

                    <blockquote><p>Kassa continues, <em>“For programmers and devs building, I urge them to build a profile and open a free lightning wallet with sost.tech and similar initiatives to get paid in bitcoin. BTrust Builders may also be a solid destination for experienced computer engineers and enthusiasts. Hashlabs Mining Ethiopia, and various additional sponsors, will be supporting these educational and vocational efforts via the funded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CjXyZdyUY-J0oag-p260iqRUMegTCkhX/view">Hashlabs Education Fund</a> and BitcoinBirr.”</em></p></blockquote><p>BitcoinBirr, a community of educators and innovators, boasts a strong vision for providing bitcoin learning materials across several languages and regions. <a href="http://t.me/bitcoinbirr">Telegram</a> is the most popular platform for communication among its mods and members. Most recently Kal Kassa gave a presentation titled “Mining Bitcoin of the Nile River” at <a href="https://bitcoin-oasis.com/">Bitcoin Oasis in Dubai</a>. In the next few weeks, and with sponsors from across the world, BitcoinBirr would like to complete the bitcoin training of all 2,000 staff at INSA, in addition to other institutions and organizations that have requested bitcoin education.</p><p>Beyond hackathons and presentations, Hashlabs Mining is committed to the training of talent in tech. Private sector leaders like Mehrteab Leul and Associates (MLA), Yingke Consultants, Grant Thornton Advisory, MMCY Tech, Boseti Energy Exploration, Meedo Records, HabeshaView, Flawless Events, Education Matters Addis, Tryst Cafe, Ethiopian Airlines and Sheraton Addis are highly appreciated and we honor your friendship during our work in Ethiopia.</p><h2>Ethiopia can leverage mining to build a bitcoin treasury</h2><p>The Ethiopian Investment Holdings (EIH), the country's sovereign wealth fund, has been rumored to partner with a Chinese bitcoin and data mining group. As per a LinkedIn post shared by EIH’s official account, we understand the project will consist of a multi-million dollar investment.</p><figure>

                    <p>Given the natural series of events that occur with bitcoin miners, the accumulation of bitcoin may be a way for Ethiopia’s treasury to maintain a balance of BTC on behalf of its country. As methods for collateral and proof of reserves develop within the bitcoin “space”, these reserves may be used to prove creditworthiness.</p><p>The events surrounding Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may also be instructive to Ethiopians.</p><p>There is also a sentiment from some Bitcoiners that governments should not be involved in bitcoin mining. And that bitcoin is an experiment by cryptopunks and libertarians to create tools for the free market. Given Ethiopia's recent communist history from 1974 to 1991, Ethiopia’s citizens and leaders may need a refresher course on the Austrian School of Economics.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>We are witnessing significant development in real time. It’s difficult to point towards a singular event or catalyst. But we are at the center of a very serious and interesting moment in our history. The moment we are experiencing allows value to be generated from an open and free community of bitcoin miners. And this novel technology allows humanity to preserve value across time and space.</p><p>As we dive into the future, it may also be important to note the need for humility. It should be remembered that over the past few years, Ethiopians and East Africa have witnessed a haunting amount of death and destruction, often self-inflicted and many times manipulated on the world stage. </p><p>We can’t bring back our fallen friends. Like our dear brother Tekeste Sebhat Nega, an early bitcoiner and a visionary. He lost his life in the last few weeks of 2020. An energetic and smart young man died in a senseless civil war. And there are many more stories like him. The entire country is going through a syndrome of sorts, so let’s remain humble as we carry the burden.<br><br>Let’s move with purpose, passion, and dignity toward a future that values math and physics more than fiat and violence. That is our hope for ourselves and that’s the energy with which we will operate in Ethiopia.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jaran Mellerud & Kal Kassa.

Roman Reher of Blocktrainer, the largest German-speaking Bitcoin YouTube channel, and Kristian Kläger, CEO and founder of terahash.energy GmbH, delivered two formidable introductory presentations in the German Parliament. Since German politicians still mainly associate Bitcoin with criminal activities, money laundering, and climate damage, the objective was to nurture a better understanding of the unique opportunities Bitcoin has to offer.</p><p>Privacy was paramount to kickstarting the event. Given that Bitcoin remains a complicated subject in German politics, ensuring full privacy for attending MPs and their staff was crucial to spare them potential reprimands from their party leaders. The event was well-attended, also by visitors from outside. Since MPs preferred to take a backseat on the main floor, ordinary visitors were invited to fill the front seats. Overall, the event was a big success, and more Bitcoin events in the Bundestag are in the pipeline. While cameras were not permitted during the main event, a few exclusive moments later allowed for capturing select opinions on camera.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5YaVed1C4Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Joana Cotar is the founder of the initiative 'Bitcoin im Bundestag.' As a party-independent MP, she has the privilege of putting Bitcoin on the agenda, for example, during debates about the introduction of the digital Euro. As a party member, this would not have been possible.</p><p>Still, her former affiliation with the right-wing AfD poses challenges too. In German politics, guilt by association is a strong mechanism, and no party wants to collaborate with the AfD. It creates a political vacuum and has led to discussions within the Berlin Bitcoin community. According to her it is good to remind oneself that Bitcoin is apolitical, uncensorable, and free money, and even your worst enemy can use it.</p><p>Also in the German parliament, Bitcoin is a bottom up movement, and according to Joana Cotar, the staff of the MPs play a crucial role in getting the topic on the agenda. They work long hours with the MPs, and are also often consciously encouraged by Members of the German Parliament to explore new topics. </p><p>In the following interview, Joana Cotar provides unprecedented insights into the workings of German politics. She discusses the free access banking lobbyists have to the German parliament, their strong influence on MPs, and articulates concrete requests such as making Bitcoin legal tender, allowing for self-custody, promoting sustainable Bitcoin mining, and urging opposition to the introduction of the digital Euro.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xqIkrCAjnR8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p><em>This is a guest post by Daniel van Heel.

<p>The Bitcoin market witnessed a flurry of activity as BTC surged to its new peak as BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF did over $1 billion in trading volume for the sixth consecutive day yesterday. Bitcoin's previous all time high of $69,010 happened almost three years ago on November 10, 2021, 846 days ago. </p><p>For the month of February, Bitcoin had the biggest green monthly candle in its history, rising almost $20,000 that month alone. To put into context how bullish that month was price wise, the bear market bottom for bitcoin was ~$16,000, meaning bitcoin pumped almost $4,000 more than that alone in February.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> had its biggest monthly green candle EVER in February 🤯🚀 <a href="https://t.co/BsaCIXGTJx">pic.twitter.com/BsaCIXGTJx</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1763669115275735372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin's meteoric rise has been fueled by a variety of factors, including increasing institutional adoption, growing interest from retail investors, and broader acceptance by traditional financial institutions. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical tensions and inflationary concerns have propelled demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty.</p><p>US spot Bitcoin ETFs had their second biggest day in terms of trading volume yesterday, <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1764730139512848543?s=20">according</a> to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. BlackRock's ETF was responsible for $2.4 billion of the $5.5 billion traded yesterday. Last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs bought over 30,029 BTC, while miners only mined 6,160 new BTC. This massive demand and very limited supply of bitcoin being created every day has been the main driver causing bitcoin's price to increase dramatically.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s the weekly summary (Feb. 24 - March 1, h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/HODL15Capital?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HODL15Capital</a>). <br><br>Keep it simple: There is more demand than new supply. <a href="https://t.co/ighWC0hOOi">pic.twitter.com/ighWC0hOOi</a></p>&mdash; Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan/status/1763941918390813029?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2024</a></blockquote>

But, one way or another, I have to get myself up to speed, and I do that best cathartically through writing. As a result, you, the reader, are left here to suffer. So, you know, don’t forget to renew your paid subscriptions to <em>Fringe Finance.</em></p><p>Enough with the prelude — we all know it has been a breathtaking week for bitcoin, which is up well over 20% in just the span of days.</p><figure>

                    <p>The moves have done well to spin up even more interest in the cryptocurrency than there was over the last month with the launch of the ETFs. Hell, even Morgan Stanley came out this week and said they were thinking of throwing their hat into the ring and launching a bitcoin fund of their own.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>I’ve gotten a number of phone calls and texts about bitcoin, and I’m not even a prominent member of the community, nor am I a well-known bull. And so I can’t even imagine the outreach that maximalists and longtime advocates have seen this week.</p><p>Undoubtedly, it is exciting, and I can’t even imagine how long people have been waiting to savor this moment, after years of abuse from family members and uninformed assholes like myself, as well as general doubt about the asset class. But, if there is one small lesson I have learned from decades in the capital markets that I think translates across asset classes, it is to <em><strong>celebrate modestly and prepare for the worst.</strong></em></p><p>That may seem like the furthest thing from people's minds this week, but for me, it has always been the best way to savor success. Many people who listened to the <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/talking-bitcoin-on-the-what-bitcoin">podcast that I did a couple of weeks ago</a> with Peter McCormack know that it was arrogance and hubris that turned me off from bitcoin to begin with. Perhaps that is my fault for not having an open enough mind and not doing enough of my own work – it’s a mistake that saw me miss out on large gains. But today I’m speaking as one of the people who can visualize bitcoin as a long-term success and are genuinely excited about onboarding the rest of the world.</p><p>My Twitter feed over the last week has been replete with people triumphantly celebrating, bragging, and taking shots at those who doubted that the price would ever go back up again. Here’s one example from my brother James Lavish, who I know well enough to know he won’t mind me using him as an example because he knows I respect the shit out of him. Behold Exhibit A: James talking shit to Vanguard.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODA3MDc4ODc3ODY1MzA2/74490767-ccef-47c1-aab2-332780b2f120_1168x370.jpg" height="380" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Does James have a point? Yes, he does. Could be wind up being right 50 years from now also? Yes, he could. But is it karmically sound to taunt the $7.7 trillion bear? To me, not really. I’d rather just savor the satisfaction of the temporary dub quietly.</p><p>Everybody is well within their rights to celebrate this short-term action anyway they would like, but what I’m suggesting today is that karmically and psychologically, <strong>the less you force the issue and the more humility you show, the more evenly and consistently bitcoin will thread itself through the rest of the world.</strong></p><p>Think of this: celebrating making an exorbitant amount of money or rage-tweeting about your success is going to do two things: (1)it’s going to turn off people like myself who think that behavior is generally synonymous with fraud and (2) it’s going to excite investors with lower-than-average sophistication who will look for quick riches and won’t be the steady hands bitcoin needs to become a perpetual success.</p><p>Rather, what I’m suggesting is to allow the news media to do what they do (generally be useless and chase stories long after they’ve happened) and allow people to come to the realization about bitcoin the same way that I did: on my own, <strong>o</strong><strong>nce I felt as though I wasn’t being suffocated with the idea</strong> by outside sources anymore.</p><p>My interest in <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/why-i-bitcoin">looking at bitcoin this go-round</a> in early 2024 was completely organic: the news coverage of it had died down, and I had blocked or unfollowed enough people who were hyping it that I could have some clarity and some peace of mind about it when I sat down to consider how it worked, seriously, for the first time ever. It was that calm, relaxed, blank slate that allowed me to grasp the relatively complex concepts of how it worked and believe in it the way that I do now.</p><p>I think given the astronomical week that we just had, we’d be better off to “act like we’ve been here before” and to remember that sometimes the more you push an idea, the more people are prone to resistance than barking like hyenas and taunting people. If bitcoin had a $50 trillion market cap, that’d be a different story. But we’re still in the early stages of this courtship with the rest of the world and, like any good relationship or friendship in your life, there has to be a genuine organic interest in “showing up” to the idea of it happening. All of those who have been smothered by a partner or a friend in the past know that all it does is create distortions and unhealthy dynamics. Such delicate things cannot be forced, but rather, accepted willfully like a slow, purposeful deep breath outside on a winter day.</p><p>This is not to say that I don’t believe this week is the beginning of much larger adoption that would likely drive the price of bitcoin higher. As I said on the “What Bitcoin Did” <a href="https://quoththeraven.substack.com/p/talking-bitcoin-on-the-what-bitcoin">podcast</a>, I believe that there is at least one, if not several, nation-states looking at putting bitcoin on their sovereign balance sheets, and that this will kick off a period of game theory for the digital asset revolution the likes of which we haven’t seen yet. Just days after I said that, yesterday Edward Snowden came out and postulated the same.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0ODA3MDY3MzM1MTQwNjk4/c08bc4b2-7955-4aa1-8618-0a5e139e5e9e_1174x372.jpg" height="380" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p><em>Try to keep up with me, Eddie.</em></p><p>But in all seriousness, we know what will happen if the price continues to rise. The hype will continue to flywheel further, as will interest and adoption. People will have the same realization that it took me a decade to figure out: this thing simply isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. But if you ask me, especially given the fact that we all know how quickly price moves can whipsaw back to the downside in the short term, I think the community would be well served to focus less on spiking the football here and more on how we will be able to clearly explain and convey the transformation that is unfolding before our eyes in a calm, measured, and comprehensive way.</p><p>After all, whose questions do you want to deal with on the next 20% overnight whipsaw lower: unsophisticated maniacs or measured investors who already know and expect the volatility that is a certainty.</p><p>And the more time we spend setting reasonable expectations that bitcoin can easily exceed, instead of overpromising and underdelivering, the less time we have to brag about being right. The journey is the reward. Or, as the bible says:</p><blockquote><p>“When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom.”</p><p>— Proverbs 11:2</p></blockquote><p>But I think if Jesus were around today, he would simply tell us to “let bitcoin cook”.</p><figure>

BSN, presented by <a href="https://www.genbitcoin.org/">Generation Bitcoin</a>, operates as a one-stop platform providing logistical, educational, and financial resources to students interested in Bitcoin.</p><p>BSN's primary goal is to connect students globally, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among young individuals passionate about Bitcoin. The network facilitates the creation and scaling of student clubs dedicated to Bitcoin, offering support and financial assistance to affiliated clubs.</p><p>"The word 'network' is mentioned 21 times in the bitcoin whitepaper," said Ella Hough, Co-founder and Project Lead at Generation Bitcoin. "Satoshi was too purposeful for this amount to be a coincidence.

BSN aims to remove barriers to creating student Bitcoiner communities and strengthen Bitcoin’s Layer 0, the social/human layer." </p><p>BSN aims to act as a bridge between students and the broader Bitcoin industry, facilitating communication and collaboration between educational institutions and industry players. By providing access to resources, job opportunities, and mentorship, BSN aims to strengthen the social fabric of Bitcoin's human layer, known as Layer 0.</p><p>The network operates on core values such as freedom through knowledge, open-source principles, proof of work, and first principles thinking. These values underpin BSN's distributed yet organized structure, with a founding team, industry board of advisors, and student board of advisors guiding its operations.</p><p>For students, BSN offers a plethora of opportunities, including starting or growing university Bitcoin clubs, accessing educational and job opportunities, and connecting with like-minded individuals in the Bitcoin community.</p><p>"A key part of my journey has been educating the next generation about Bitcoin," stated Generation Bitcoin Growth Lead and Co-founder Arsh Molu. "The Bitcoin Students Network aims to provide support for university clubs as well as equip students with resources, knowledge, and job opportunities worldwide."</p><p>Industry players are also encouraged to participate by organizing events, providing financial support, donating resources, offering mentorship, and sharing internship and job opportunities.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0Nzg0OTM1OTA1NTM1NDgw/unnamed-15.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0Nzg0OTM1OTA1NTM1NDgw/unnamed-15.jpg"><media:title>unnamed-15</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Will Bitcoin Transform into Just Another Stock Amidst Institutional Surge and ETF Integration?  ]]></title><description><![CDATA[An analysis of the inverting correlation between Bitcoin and other financial markets, and the implications this could have for the Bitcoin market.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/will-bitcoin-transform-into-just-another-stock-amidst-institutional-surge-and-etf-integration-</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/will-bitcoin-transform-into-just-another-stock-amidst-institutional-surge-and-etf-integration-</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Price Correlation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[S&P500]]></category><category><![CDATA[Gold]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Maria Carola]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0Nzg0MTUzMTQ3NzQ1Nzg0/bitcoinchain.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steering through a sea of change in the crypto market, the investment game is experiencing a seismic shift. Spot Bitcoin ETFs already exist, signaling Bitcoin's leap into mainstream finance and knitting it closer to conventional investment fabrics. We'll look at the tip of the iceberg trying to imagine its true depth as well as the current correlation between Bitcoin, stocks, and Gold. We’ll attempt to figure out if the traditional market is really leading Bitcoin out of its decentralized place, or if there's still an avenue for hope that it can maintain its unique path.</p><p>According to the Kaiko data, Bitcoin's risk-adjusted returns were superior to traditional assets. Nvidia led with the highest returns on a risk-adjusted basis, while Bitcoin impressively trailed just behind, outpacing major traditional assets like the S&P 500, Gold, with its value surging over 160% in risk-adjusted terms. </p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Meanwhile, according to the IMF Crypto Cycle and US Monetary Policy study, 80% of variation in crypto prices and its increasing correlation with equity markets <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/08/04/The-Crypto-Cycle-and-US-Monetary-Policy-534834">coincided</a> with the entry of institutional investors into crypto markets since 2020. In particular, trading volumes by institutions on crypto exchanges grew by more than 1,700% (from roughly $25 billion to more than $450 billion) during the second quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021. According to the study, the US monetary policy affects the crypto cycle, just like global equity cycles, but surprisingly, only the US Fed's monetary policy matters, not the other major central banks – probably because crypto markets are highly USD-dependent.</p><p>Furthermore, the 2023 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Outlook Survey <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/ru/institutional/research-insights/resources/education/2023-institutional-investor-digital-assets-outlook-survey">indicates</a> that 64% of investors are set to up their stakes in the crypto sphere within three years, allocating up to 5% of AUM to crypto. It said a number of institutions made investments for the first time over the past year, while others increased their existing investments. While the study highlights a surge in crypto commitment from 41% of asset managers, only 27% of asset owners seem to be ramping up their stakes.</p><p>Although Bitcoin was born from the idea of spreading power equally, recent studies indicate that it's slowly becoming dominated by a select few big players.</p><h2>Changing Correlation Dynamics</h2><p>Interestingly, <a href="https://stealthex.io/blog/bitcoin-price-prediction/">Bitcoin</a> moves in sync with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, with an impressive correlation. Meanwhile, the correlation between Bitcoin and Gold has sharply decreased recently, contrasting with claims that investors see crypto as a safe haven or hedge against inflation, a role traditionally played by Gold.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0Nzg0MTYxNDY5MjQ0NDQ1/image2.png" height="311" width="1200">
                        <figcaption><em>Source: TheBlock</em></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Notably, Bitcoin's correlation with Gold was positive at 0.83 on November 7, 2023, but decreased to -0.1 on January 10, 2024, before rebounding to a marginally higher positive level 0.14 on February 9, 2024. In the meantime, Bitcoin's relationship with the S&P 500 saw a negative correlation of -0.76 on November 11, 2023, and then hit a positive correlation of 0.57 in January 2024. Ths shift from negative to positive correlation points to Bitcoin's changing perception among investors.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite, known for its technology and growth stocks, also displayed a variable correlation with Bitcoin. The negative correlation, of -0.69 on October 30, 2023, shifted to positive 0.44 in January. It seems traders are linking Bitcoin's rhythm to the tech sector's pulse, hinting at a new kinship in investment strategies.</p><p>When the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional equity markets like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq increases, while its correlation with Gold decreases, it suggests that Bitcoin is behaving more like a risk-on asset rather than a safe haven. When investors are feeling venturous, they often swing toward stocks and digital coins for the chance at juicier profits.</p><p>If institutional and retail investors are increasingly involved in both equity and cryptocurrency markets, their simultaneous buy and sell decisions could cause the price movements of these assets to align.</p><p>Spot Bitcoin ETFs getting the green light seem to be ramping up its charm for big-time investors, with a solid chunk already planning to boost their Bitcoin game. Bitcoin's move into ETFs might make it act more like stocks since those funds are big players in the stock world.</p><p>Amidst these developments, the essence of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, free from the confines of traditional financial systems, could be undermined. Moreover, these shifts could expose Bitcoin to the very systemic risks from which it was designed to escape.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts </h2><p>As we look at how spot Bitcoin ETFs might shake up Bitcoin's role in the market and its current tie to stocks, we need to keep a sharp eye on balancing our excitement for more big players jumping in and the possible growth with staying true to Bitcoin's core principle of not being centrally controlled. Bitcoin's move toward a more centralized investment scene could stir the market, offering bright opportunities, but also tough challenges ahead. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Maria Carola.

                    <p>The United States federal government has once again added to its substantial Bitcoin hoard, transferring $922 million worth from wallets associated with Bitfinex hackers in a seizure.</p><p>Over the course of a series of various seizures and other asset forfeitures, the United States federal government has accumulated and holds enough Bitcoin to unquestionably count as one of the largest whales. In the earliest days of the Bitcoin scene, the overwhelming crypto-anarchist spirit among the community led to a series of various extralegal business ventures, most famously the Silk Road. This overtly illegalist era of the industry is more or less completely over, but the success of these early ventures accumulated massive amounts of Bitcoin: which has in time been accumulated by the US government.</p><p>The Silk Road alone has been at the center of several massive seizures from law enforcement agencies, with the site’s actual coffers far from the only source. On multiple <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/crypto911.html">occasions</a> over the last few <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/268743/u-s-appeals-court-finalizes-mandate-for-forfeiture-of-silk-road-bitcoin">years</a>, various hackers who robbed the Silk Road have in turn seen their assets seized and added to the federal government’s massive stockpile. Even though <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/us-government-dumps-bitcoin-silk-road">hundreds</a> of millions of bitcoins from this source have already been sold at government auctions or through other means, there are still billions left to go. For their part, law enforcement agencies seem to be in no <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/federal-government-bitcoin-5-billion-78ce0938?st=y3p0zfhiipykvjk&s=09">hurry</a> to wash their hands of these assets. </p><figure>

                    <p>On February 29, the stockpile <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/u-s-gov-moves-922-million-seized-bitcoin">grew</a> once again when the government moved more than 15k bitcoins from the wallets of two Bitfinex hackers. The hackers, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan, recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/crypto-heist-mastermind-ilya-lichtenstein-turned-us-cooperating-witness?sref=IIP4JEyu">testified</a> about their 2016 hack of Bitfinex, which ranks as one of the most profitable heists of all time with nearly 120k bitcoins stolen. Bitfinex, one of the oldest still-operating exchanges in the entire crypto ecosystem, is still a prominent service, but their operations still bear lingering scars from a theft of this magnitude. For one thing, US citizens are completely forbidden from accessing the platform, along with citizens from several other countries. Perhaps it is for this reason that the Justice Department has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/02/28/us-government-crypto-wallets-transfer-nearly-1b-of-bitcoin-seized-from-bitfinex-hacker/">refused</a> to state whether or not the government intends to reimburse Bitfinex’s 2016 customers, who actually had their money stolen.</p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>Regardless of what the government’s plans are with this money, a seizure like this has once again highlighted the sheer <a href="https://decrypt.co/219720/us-government-owns-12-billion-worth-bitcoin-heres-why">size</a> of the federal government’s Bitcoin reserve. Thankfully, the government’s dealings with these assets are all a matter of public record, and Bitcoin transactions themselves are all completely transparent on the blockchain. For this reason, analysts are confident in the claim that the United States holds just shy of 200k bitcoins, worth approximately $12.1 billion. This makes them unmistakably one of the largest whales out there, with only Binance and Satoshi holding greater amounts. In fact, the government currently holds nearly 1% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Regardless of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/federal-government-bitcoin-5-billion-78ce0938?st=y3p0zfhiipykvjk&s=09">claims</a> that prosecutors have no interest in maximizing profits when disposing of these assets, it’s undeniable that the government holds substantial leverage over the whole space.</p><p>These seizures are particularly interesting due to some recent <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/edward-snowden-anticipates-government-acquisition-of-bitcoin-in-2024">comments</a> made by exiled whistleblower Edward Snowden. Specifically, considering the rising global acceptance of Bitcoin in regulation and traditional finance, Snowden predicted that “A national government will be revealed this year to have been buying Bitcoin—the modern replacement for monetary gold—without having disclosed that fact publicly”. If Bitcoin is the digital gold, after all, it would only make sense that powerful nations would want to build up reserves. The strategy has famously worked for the Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele, who greeted the new bull market with a <a href="https://decrypt.co/219525/el-salvador-bitcoin-40-percent-profit-nayib-bukele-defiant">declaration</a> that his country’s Bitcoin investment has gone up by 40% since the initial purchases. Not, of course, that he plans to sell.</p><p>In any event, Snowden’s comments seem especially relevant in that the United States hasn’t actually purchased any of the Bitcoin it currently holds. Even though the government has a theoretical responsibility to dispose of these assets, the pace as of yet has been glacial, and in the meantime, it would be extremely straightforward for Congress to halt these sales. All it would take is a desire for the policy to change, and a genuine Bitcoin reserve could spring up overnight. This is the crux of Snowden’s specific prediction that governments will acquire Bitcoin secretly and that the government has ample plausible deniability. We don’t have a reserve; we just happen to be reserving these assets for a later sale. There is nothing suspicious about that!</p><p>If a government did actually want to acquire massive quantities of Bitcoin in secret, it would run into a great number of transparency problems caused by the trustless nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain. The anonymous “Mr. 100” has made <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2024/02/26/mysterious-mr-100-quietly-buying-bitcoin-in-massive-quantities-say-on-chain-analysts-heres-who-the-entity-might-be/">headlines</a> throughout the month of February, acquiring a mind boggling 100 BTC per day and reaching the status of the 15th largest whale. As chain analysts have tried to determine the buyer’s identity, <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/the-bitcoin-market-surge-unraveling">speculation</a> has already begun that a national government is the culprit. Based on the timing of the purchases and several other factors, the buyer is likely in Asia, specifically the Middle East. Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia—all these are strong candidates to be the coins’ rightful owners.</p><p>In other words, if a government wishes to build up a Bitcoin reserve, it might be easier to seize the assets outright rather than buy them at fair value. After all, if the transactions will be recorded on the blockchain either way, why not save their money? The UK seems well-positioned to build up a stockpile in this way like the Americans, having <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7aec98dd-6161-4ee9-8e0e-654fc7e0fae3">seized</a> $1.77 billion in January. Not only were these bitcoins seized from a foreign national currently on the run, with no recourse to recoup these funds, but the British government has <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/01/uk-law-enforcement-will-soon-have-more-power-to-seize-crypto-assets/">subsequently</a> passed legislation deepening its power to seize or freeze cryptocurrency assets. It wouldn’t take much to start building up a notable hoard in its own right.</p><p>By this point, the days when Bitcoin’s core community held a defiant attitude towards law enforcement are a distant memory. Although people can commit crimes centered around Bitcoin just like they can with any other currency, the fact of the matter is that Bitcoin is only becoming more legitimate for the world’s governments. US regulators approved a Bitcoin ETF, and other <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-start-trading-in-brazil-tomorrow">countries</a> are falling like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/largest-south-korean-parties-promise-bitcoin-etfs-before-election">dominoes</a> to endorse it themselves. Eventually, it’ll be a necessity for powerful governments to stay on par with their competitors and maintain their own reserves of Bitcoin. The US, after all, controls nearly 1% of a massive industry with substantial leverage over it. Are they going to be the only country with this leverage? It may be difficult for any nation to build up these stockpiles in secret, but even so, the race has already begun. No matter who wins it, it’s Bitcoin that will be on top in the end. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NzgzMTQxMTQ2MDc2NjY0/governmentseize.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NzgzMTQxMTQ2MDc2NjY0/governmentseize.jpg"><media:title>governmentseize</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NzgzMTY5NjAwMjM0NTI1/f3a374db-8e34-4c0d-b28c-4dc4f62cf7fa_790x601.jpg"><media:title>f3a374db-8e34-4c0d-b28c-4dc4f62cf7fa_790x601</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://coingape.com/u-s-governments-bitcoin-holdings-surge-to-8-3-billion-outpaces-microstrategy/">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Final Agreement On EIA Emergency Survey Released]]></title><description><![CDATA[The details of the agreement between the EIA and Texas Blockchain Council & Riot Platforms has been published.

Furthermore, they will also cancel and withdraw the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/second-eia-survey-extension-being-pushed-with-open-comment-period">February 9th, 2024 notice</a> for collection, replacing it with a new Notice.</p><p>This new notice will run for a full 60 days from the date it is released in the Federal Register, and the EIA also has consented to ensure that any comments which have been received on the Feb. 9th notice will be incorporated and considered in the new notice.</p><p>So here’s the takeaway: the Government has to go back to the well and do it right. They can’t use a pretextual political “emergency” to ram this through, and fortunately the Mining industry, through the quick and decisive work of the Texas Blockchain Council & Riot, blocked that clear violation.</p><p>But the flight is not over, we have to file our comments on the new data collection notice as soon as it’s released. And you can see that the fight is going to be harder, as groups antagonistic to bitcoin mining are already jumping into the fray.</p><p>The Sierra Club <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172776308/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172776308.18.1_1.pdf">attempted to file an amicus brief</a> in this case. That brief, which did make it on the record (though it was<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172776308/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172776308.21.0.pdf"> opposed as improper</a> and it’s moot now anyway), shows their arguments that they will likely elaborate on in a filing supporting the EIA’s new data collection.

Clearly not enough to cover the expense, but still a sweet surprise. But let’s be clear, nothing in this agreement is “an admission of liability or wrongdoing… .” Sure, and “[s]omething is rotten in the state of Denmark,” which can be smelt all the way in Waco, Texas.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Colin Crossman.

The existing paradigm mirrors the primal imperative of reaping benefits in exchange for labor–working to survive, but the pay-per-time system in the labor market is creating the incentive to get something for nothing. In the whole “fiat stack,” everyone optimizes their efforts to achieve this on different levels, as I explain below. How can I get money for nothing? As we explore the effects of instant settlement across diverse industries, a fundamental divide between workers and clockwatchers emerges, as I have argued throughout this series. Fiat payments work without instant settlement; instead, a virtual credit arrives immediately with the actual settlement usually coming much later. The Lightning Network enables instant settlement. That is a key advantage, and it’s why Bitcoin is the only financial network that has the potential to achieve the vision that I am describing in this series.<br><br></p><p>The fiat monetary system is training us to play the game of rent-seeking without realizing it, and it is no wonder that the best players become the richest. From our first jobs, we learn how to extract maximum payment for minimum effort, and the incentives reward creative ways of doing just that. The first trick everyone learns is how to “milk the clock” by doing as little as possible without getting fired. A slightly more advanced technique is learning how to take credit for others’ work. Skilled players seek promotions in order to gain access to others’ labor for their own benefit. This is the fiat game.</p><p>As if that weren’t bad enough, the rent-seeking game also corrodes skills. Just as my results in the gym are correlated with the effort I invest into my workout, employees’ mastery comes from effort. But time-based compensation rewards passing time rather than performance, allowing skills to atrophy. In technologically primitive societies, skill development was imperative for survival. The problem was friction: assessing the value for each miniscule action and compensating each one individually. So the obvious way to reduce friction was to collapse all the tasks into a single variable — time. But after decades of time-based compensation and diminishing initiative, we are becoming lethargic, weak, skill-deficient, and reliant on free money. The result is a culture of dependency, where the quest for easy money overshadows the pursuit of self-improvement. How many steps are we from enslaving our own children to avoid working?</p><p>Perhaps the key to overcoming this fate is deciding not to chase the fucking money, but to pursue other goals instead and just using the money to achieve them. Make a list of what you want in life and start working towards it. Instead of working for wages, saving money, and buying a house, you can build your own house. Yes, it will take years, but that is the point. Do the work! If you object that you can’t build a house, you’re probably right. You can’t do anything until you can. It’s simply a matter of placing one brick on top of another, a roof on top of the walls, and so on. Work transforms us, makes us better, faster, stronger, and more skillful versions of our former selves. Bitcoin preserves the value of your energy, allowing you to achieve your goals faster than is possible with fiat. When you are working for others’ goals, you should be compensated instantly, which is almost like double compensation. You get skills and money. In the fiat system, when you get free money (money for time passed), you do not acquire any skills, and the skills you have start to atrophy because you are not using them. The only incentive that pushes people to do something is the fear of getting fired. That is why they seek to find the balance right between minimal work and not getting fired.</p><p>But there remains an undeniable obstacle: why should I work for my money rather than simply waiting and receiving it without exertion? The status quo is comfortable, but comfort is the enemy. Defeating this enemy requires a collective willingness to break free from the allure of effortless gains and embracing a more natural, purposeful way of working.</p><p>Those who shun time-based compensation will have the advantage of attracting and retaining the most exceptional individuals as employees. As these forward-thinkers continually evolve–growing faster, stronger, and more skillful over time–their products and services will outshine pay-per-time systems.</p><p>In the new market landscape I have described throughout this series, employees who are paid for their work rather than their time are no longer tethered to a single company. The quality of products and services is propelled by the collective efforts of the contributors rather than malingering clock milkers supervised and pushed by management. Labor exploitation becomes untenable, and pay-for-work is what retains the best talent. This is true simply because the best want to be paid based on results, and the only fair compensation to both the employee and employer is pay-per-work, which is based on those results.</p><p>This newfound power may lead individuals to focus on the things they want to see built rather than what the company tells them to build. They gain not only a decentralized income but can also benefit the most from the tasks they complete. If there is an open project to fix ten roads, I will contribute to fixing the one that I use most. It is the most selfish altruistic thing. That benefit is not private; it is shared. The money I receive is private. As long as we chase money rather than projects, it is no surprise we are indifferent towards other people's problems. In this new paradigm, the balance of power shifts decisively to the people, aligning with their preferences and aspirations, not the agenda of a single company.</p><p>Additionally, the pay-for-work system mirrors the competitive nature of sports–individuals are compensated for their time and effort, but victory is contingent on active participation and skill. In sports, the best players distinguish themselves with their superior skills, the effort they invest, and their adaptability in the face of competition. This natural dynamic, favoring the fastest, strongest, and most adaptable, can now enrich the labor market. Survival and prosperity will hinge not only on individual effort but on the ability to outperform others in the pursuit of a larger share of benefits. Even those merely chasing money prosper by simply mirroring Bitcoin. If I do something selfishly in Bitcoin, the whole network benefits.</p><p>In the world of sports, fame and wealth often follow the best players, but their initial motivation lies in the desire to be the best. Encouragement in the pay-for-work labor market takes the form of payment, catalyzing continued dedication and progress. The accumulation of these payments, akin to encouragement, propels people to refine their skills, enhance their performance, and, in turn, receive more Bitcoin in acknowledgment of their efforts.</p><p>The reward in this system is not acclaim or praise; it starts as a necessity for money and progresses to satisfaction derived from the work. Instant settlement becomes the Trojan horse guiding us back to this ethos. In this continuous competition, unlike the win-lose dynamics of warfare, everyone stands to gain. Individuals work for themselves, driven by the desire to achieve their own goals, while the finished product simultaneously serves a common need because a lot of them are collective goods. The swifter, more efficient, and cost-effective completion of tasks that benefit the community will induce a snowball effect where subsequent benefits build on previous ones. In this interconnected web, where everyone coordinates efficiently, there is no theft or exploitation; rather, it is a shared journey toward collective betterment.</p><p>With pay-for-time, people seek to climb the hierarchy and obtain the privilege of delegating, which lets them shift accountability and find scapegoats. In stark contrast, the pay-for-work built on instant-settlement systems operates like the immutable and uncompromising laws of physics. Every individual bears complete responsibility for their work. This paradigm gauges individuals not by their inclination to assign blame or dwell on problems, but by their responsibility and their commitment to accomplishing the job at hand. The best performance yields the most money, so pay-for-work puts the job first, unlike pay-for-time, where more money results from more time passed, and the job is almost irrelevant. In the pay-for-work system, responsibility becomes a measure of personal and professional integrity, fostering a culture where the focus is on getting the work done efficiently and collaboratively.</p><p>Roy Sheinfeld, Breez CEO and my boss, has said that we should not tell people what experiences to create in their apps. I agree. The point of the previous chapters was to spark interest in the possibilities so the experts can create those experiences. I am not the right person to say how construction, logistics, book publishing, and other industries should evolve. I am trying to open the window for them to realize the potential they can create and build for all of us. If they do this we all win. They receive Bitcoin, and in turn, we spend Bitcoin more efficiently on things that enrich our lives. This collaborative venture is an invitation to explore, innovate, and contribute to a shared future where everyone stands to gain.</p><p>Here’s a quick recap with the take-home messages from the previous articles in this series:</p><p>The first article: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/instant-settlement-the-construction-industry">The Construction Industry</a></p><ul><li>What is work?</li><li>The conflict between people who are asked to work but benefit from passing time without working.</li><li>How reputation depends on the work done, not someone’s job title.</li></ul><p>Second article: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/instant-settlement-the-logistics-industry">The Logistics Industry</a></p><ul><li>How delaying payments creates counterparty risk.</li><li>How intermediaries (banks) compound that risk.</li><li>How split payments align everyone’s incentives to deliver on a project.</li><li>Decentralization fostering competition.</li></ul><p>Third article: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/instant-settlement-series-the-publishing-industry">The Publishing Industry</a></p><ul><li>The dematerialized economy is now on steroids</li><li>The benefit of any work is determined more by demand for it than supply of it</li><li>Talking and selling are not the same, so commissions are the best way to compensate influencers </li></ul><p>Forth article: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/instant-settlement-series-real-time-streaming-payments">Real-time Streaming Payments</a></p><ul><li>Benefiting from work can be a continuous process with streaming payments.</li><li>Global benefits deserve global compensation.</li><li>Auctioning seats to events can transform live entertainment.</li></ul><p>Fifth article: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/instant-settlement-series-betting">The Gambling Industry</a></p><ul><li>Fiat is gambling. </li><li>Licenses and credentials disadvantage the poor and reinforce the power of the rich.</li><li>How to invest wisely.</li></ul><p>A transitional period is crucial. If a business were to suddenly shift to a performance-based pay model without considering the existing workforce, it could lead to unrest and prompt employees to leave for a pay-per-time company. Those who recognize the need for change should adopt a long-term perspective and implement both payment methods – pay-per-time and instant settlement – simultaneously. The objective is to have these methods coexist, attracting top performers and fostering a culture of excellence. Once the company establishes a foundation of high-performing individuals, it can then phase out the pay-per-time structure entirely. I draw inspiration for this approach from my mentor from a distance, Jeff Booth, as these two systems represent distinct paradigms, necessitating a careful and strategic transition rather than an abrupt shift.</p><p>These are my final messages:</p><p><em>Build utility, do not promise future fortunes.</em></p><p><em>Do not wait or ask permission to do work.

Bitpacs are essentially normal bitcoin multisig wallets with the additional introduction of public auditability. Traditionally in a multisig setup, participants of the multisig are not disclosed. In a Bitpac multisig, participants are intentionally made public, which allows for transparent auditability. With this transparency, unique features, tooling, rules, and transaction crafting is possible. The goal of Bitpacs is to emulate the familiar DAO experience on other chains. </p><p>DAO’s are marketed as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. However, Ethereum and other altcoin based DAOs only inherit the “decentralization” of their chain, so will not be as decentralized as the same experience built on Bitcoin. DAO’s are also not autonomous, as humans control and shape the decisions they make. The Bitpac definition is a more honest explanation of the tech involved and I think eventually will be a better experience for users. <br>Why should bitcoiners even care about DAO’s? As of Feb 18th 2024, DAO’s on Ethereum hold over $35 billion in treasury funds. There have been millions of DAO proposal makers and voters, and hundreds of millions of dollars have been transacted via DAO governance. (<a href="https://deepdao.io/organizations">source</a>) There is clear demand for on-chain governance and community management, Bitpacs allow this to come to Bitcoin.</p><p><br>How can Bitpacs actually work?</p><p>While Bitpacs don't directly utilize smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain itself, they achieve similar functionality as DAOs through a combination of multisig wallets and carefully crafted Bitcoin transactions. The structures possible with this encompass most of what a DAO does:</p><ul><li>Multisig ensures that no one is ever in unilateral control of any Bitpac funds, requiring the quorum threshold to spend anything.</li></ul><ul><li>Signing thresholds that mandate how many signatures are needed to finalize a transaction (3 of 5 or 6 of 10 for example) can fine tune required voting thresholds in line with the defined Bitpac consensus requirements. </li><li>Time constraints can be applied to voting rounds, ending the signing process for proposals that haven’t achieved a signing threshold by the end of a voting period. </li><li>Gating membership of Bitpacs based on certain criteria can be done at the platform level, like unique assets held, bitcoin contributed to the treasury, or known wallet addresses, all of which can be verified on-chain. </li><li>All of these dynamics that cannot be enforced through Bitcoin script or pre-signed transactions, and must resort to social enforcement, are transparently verifiable on-chain guaranteeing detection of Bitpac rule violations. </li></ul><p>What do Bitpacs enable on Bitcoin?</p><p>Bitpacs unlock exciting possibilities for bitcoin users:</p><ul><li>Community-driven funding: Fundraising for public goods, projects, or charitable causes becomes more efficient and secure with Bitpacs. Contributors can trust that funds are used as intended, thanks to the transparent nature of the multisig.</li><li>Decentralized governance: Bitpacs empower communities to make collective decisions regarding fund allocation and spending. Voting rights are distributed among key holders, ensuring a transparent and verifiable process.</li><li>Increased trust and collaboration: By eliminating the opacity often associated with traditional financial systems, Bitpacs build trust and foster collaboration between individuals with shared interests, and doing so fully on-chain.<br><br></li></ul><p>Some specific examples of Bitpac use cases include: </p><ul><li>Funding open-source development: Developers can create Bitpacs to receive community funding for their projects, with transparent spending records ensuring accountability to their backers.</li><li>Managing community treasuries: Any organization can leverage Bitpacs for transparent management of their funds, allowing members to track spending, create proposals, and participate in decision-making. </li><li>Crowdfunding: Bitpacs can be used as a means to crowdfund bitcoin from a group of supporters for a pre-established shared goal, company, investment fund, or project. </li></ul><p><br>A major lesson for the industry over the last year has been how much innovation and experimentation can still be done on native Bitcoin without requiring any changes to the network. We have seen massive interest around BitVM, Ordinals, roll-ups, sidechains, layers, metaprotocols, all within bitcoins current consensus. There is clearly a cambrian explosion of developer and user interest coming to Bitcoin which will not slow down any time soon. Tens of thousands of new niche communities will be popping up on Bitcoin in the coming years. This doesn’t include traditional companies that continue to trend towards Bitcoin adoption over time. Bitpacs can agnostically offer community organization, treasury management, and on-chain governance to all of them. </p><p>The thousands of ideas being “built on Bitcoin” should have one thing in common, eventual settlement on the base layer. Different methods of governance will be experimented with over time, but this is why Bitpacs could be the superior model. Bitpac members have direct voting access to the treasury and transactions occur at the base layer; there is no side-chain, layer, or additional protocol that Bitpac members need to trust. Potentially this cycle, people will start to realize that Bitcoin block space is just as scarce as bitcoin the asset. As we trend further towards a hyperbitcoinized world, with nation states and institutions transacting, I think that Bitpacs representing large community or entity treasuries will be one of the few things that will justify occurring at the Base layer. </p><p>–</p><p>Anybody can create Bitpacs on their own. @Tribe_btc is a centralized project I’m working on aiming to create a full tooling suite for Bitpacs. Tribe will be releasing our Bitpac documentation soon.</p><p>By Dillon Healy</p><p>BD / Partnerships BTC Inc. @dillonhealybtc</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NzEzMzY1Mzc1ODIxMzky/bitpac.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NzEzMzY1Mzc1ODIxMzky/bitpac.jpg"><media:title>bitpac</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Anduro: A Network of Sidechains]]></title><description><![CDATA[Anduro is a federated/merge mined hybrid sidechain design, specifically designed to enable the federation to manage multiple sidechains with differing architectures.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/anduro-a-network-of-sidechains</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/anduro-a-network-of-sidechains</guid><category><![CDATA[Anduro]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sidechains]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shinobi]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 19:23:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0Njk1MzcxMDczNDYzODg4/anduro.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marathon <a href="https://twitter.com/marathondh/status/1762947336693535027?s=46&t=-CilZxNcloFTuxxYHbr-bA">yesterday announced</a> their Anduro layer two proposal. While there aren't really any fundamentally new pieces or developments in the Anduro design, they do compose in slightly different ways compared to other existing sidechain systems such as RSK or Liquid/Elements. </p><p>Anduro is a federated model that makes use of a quorum, referred to as the “Collective” in the released documents. The main distinction between Anduro and other sidechain proposals is the explicit design based around the Collective operating and being capable of spinning up and managing multiple sidechains with different architectures. This is not so dissimilar from the concept of drivechains enabled a wider network of sidechains, rather than a singular one. </p><p>Anduro is also going to be merge mined, which like RSK (also using a federated peg), does not offer any type of added security for the bitcoin pegged into the sidechain held by the federation. It does however, also like RSK, provide POW security to other assets that might be issued on the sidechain not pegged in from the mainchain and custodied by the federation. </p><h2>Peg And Consensus Model</h2><p>The actual peg between the mainchain and the sidechain is fundamentally the same thing as Liquid, and in detail looks to be roughly identical in terms of structure and implementation. The Collective will be launched with 15 members as Functionaries, the entities actually handling the multisig keys involved with managing the peg, and 50 or more Contributors, which seem to be similar to Liquid partial members that can whitelist and initiate withdrawals from the sidechain(s) even though they are not active participants in processing those withdrawals. </p><p>Also like Liquid, Anduro will also use a formal organization to handle matters of governance. I.e. handling upgrades to the network, deciding on future changes to the membership set of the federation, and in general any issues that will come up in regards to the operation of the sidechains the Collective is operating. The federation’s security ultimately relies on jurisdictional diversity in order to maintain any type of censorship resistance or safety from fund confiscation even though a federation is composed of honest members. </p><p>The interesting part of the design here, is unlike RSK, the Collective plays an active role in the consensus process beyond facilitating the operations of the peg mechanism. In Anduro, the Collective actually comes to consensus on the block contents for the sidechain through a Byztanine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm or round robin selection where a single member constructs the blocks for that round. They also periodically sign blocks to function as a checkpointing system to prevent reordering of anything in the historical past. Once signed and checkpointed, miners are incapable of reorging any sidechain blocks without the assistance of the Collective. </p><p>Both of these factors essentially function as a firewall between <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/miner-extractable-value-mev-and-programmable-money-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">Miner Extractable Value</a> opportunities and the miners. MEV is any opportunity available to miners where reordering transactions, such as front running orders on a decentralized exchange, can present an opportunity for that miner to earn extra revenue when they mine their next block. MEV has shown a tendency to increase centralization pressures for block producers in other networks it has become prevalent in. Because of the fact that the Collective is actually deciding the contents of sidechain blocks, and miners are simply committing to them with proof of work, the Collective acts as a shield against those centralizing pressures for block producers (in Bitcoin’s case miners) by taking on the role of actual block construction. </p><p>Long term Marathon states they intend to work towards trustless peg mechanisms and consensus mechanisms, specifically citing <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-big-deal-with-bitvm-arbitrary-computation-now-possible-on-bitcoin-without-a-fork">BitVM</a> as an example of how this could be achievable. While this draws into question the ability to maintain the MEV protections the current architecture has in such a transition, it currently prevents MEV from presenting a risk of centralization pressures for miners. It’s also important to note that BitVM ultimately as designed with a prover-verifier model inherently requires defined participants to manage any funds locked in a BitVM peg. While it does radically improve the security model of the peg by allowing provable penalization of dishonest participants by a single member, massive changes to BitVM’s design itself would be necessary to completely remove the need for the equivalent of a federation. </p><p>Overall the architecture strikes a nice balance of implementing a variant of existing sidechain designs, while in its current iteration intentionally creating a sort of protective layers between the sidechains and miners when it comes to the risks of MEV. </p><h2>The First Two</h2><p>On launch Anduro will have support for two sidechain architectures, one based on Bitcoin, the other on Ethereum. </p><p>Coordinate: Coordinate is the Bitcoin sidechain variant. It will implement small changes to Bitcoin, including native support for asset issuance similar to Liquid, and is intending to cater towards Ordinals and token use cases such as BRC-20, and the primitive DeFi products and services that have built up around them. </p><p>Alys: Alys is the Ethereum sidechain variant, essentially just porting the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity to a Bitcoin sidechain. The hope is that it can provide a new learning curve environment for Ethereum application developers to shift their focus towards building services and tools on top of Bitcoin.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0Njk1MzcxMDczNDYzODg4/anduro.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0Njk1MzcxMDczNDYzODg4/anduro.jpg"><media:title>anduro</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wells Fargo and Bank of America’s Merrill Are Now Offering Spot Bitcoin ETFs To Clients  ]]></title><description><![CDATA[The banks are providing access to Bitcoin ETFs to select wealth management clients with brokerage accounts upon request.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wells-fargo-and-bank-of-americas-merrill-are-now-offering-spot-bitcoin-etfs-to-clients</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wells-fargo-and-bank-of-americas-merrill-are-now-offering-spot-bitcoin-etfs-to-clients</guid><category><![CDATA[Merrill Lynch]]></category><category><![CDATA[Spot Bitcoin Etf]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bank of America]]></category><category><![CDATA[wells fargo]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:34:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0Njk0NTExNTQzNDYxMTk1/default_wells_fargo_and_bitcoin_up_close_0.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo & Co.’s brokerage unit have begun offering access to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that directly invest in Bitcoin, according to <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/bofas-merrill-wells-fargo-offer-bitcoin-etfs-to-wealth-clients">Bloomberg Law.</a></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: Wells Fargo and Bank of America’s Merrill are offering spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> ETFs to wealth clients 🚀 <a href="https://t.co/Lr3oD5XgrR">pic.twitter.com/Lr3oD5XgrR</a></p>&mdash; Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1763267798468325860?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 29, 2024</a></blockquote>

Department of Energy case. But, as often happens in litigation, things change quickly. Tuesday the judge entered an order canceling today's hearing based on the parties reaching an "agreement-in-principle" <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172776308/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172776308.17.0.pdf">on the overall dispute</a>. This agreement must be finalized and filed by Friday, March 1st.</p><p>Speculation time.</p><p>What could this mean? One element of the standard for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), and a preliminary injunction, is that the party requesting it has to show that they are "likely to succeed on the merits." This means that the judge has to believe that, not only is success possible, but more likely than not. Here, the judge already agreed that "that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the facts alleged by Defendants to support an emergency request fall far short of justifying such an action." And that the Government's action was arbitrary, capricious, or abused their discretion.</p><p>Losing the TRO, while not dispositive, is a big red flag. The Government does not like to lose, and once it has lost on this metric, it's very likely that they already know they will lose on the following motions: the preliminary injunction and the permanent injunction.</p><p>One problem there is discovery. As part of the process of proving the case, the Plaintiffs get to request internal communications and other materials that might show an abuse of discretion or undue influence. The Energy Information Administration has only used emergency data collection authority in a handful of <strong>actual emergencies</strong>, such as an emergency survey in response to the 2021 Colonial Pipeline Cyberattack.</p><p>Given the context of Senator Warren and the Biden Administration's continued attacks on Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, is there any reason to believe that there aren't unflattering emails or communications showing undue influence between those offices and the EIA? What else could have caused a historically cautious and respected agency to suddenly put out such slipshod work as the EIA-862, which was then rubber stamped by the President's own Office of Management and Budget in clear technical violation of their internal standards?</p><p>It is not like this kind of undue influence hasn't happened before... look at Custodia Bank's lawsuit, for instance, where "perhaps the most stunning fact that would never have seen the light of day but for discovery is this: in the wake of FTX’s collapse and a mysterious briefing to Vice-Chair Barr concerning Custodia’s membership and master account applications, <em><strong>Board staff edited and rewrote key parts of an internal Kansas City Fed memo</strong></em> … Discovery reveals that the Board was deeply intertwined in the outcome of Custodia’s master account request.

<p>"Prediction: A national government will be revealed this year to have been buying Bitcoin—the modern replacement for monetary gold—without having disclosed that fact publicly," Snowden <a href="https://x.com/Snowden/status/1762915456694784497?s=20">stated</a>.</p><p>Snowden's prediction comes amid increasing institutional, retail, and nation state interest in Bitcoin, with several major corporations and investment firms allocating significant resources to the asset. While Snowden did not specify which government he believes will make the purchase, the prospect of a second national government acquiring Bitcoin and making it legal tender, like El Salvador <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-approves-bitcoin-legal-tender">did</a> in 2021, would represent another huge milestone for Bitcoin.</p><p>Earlier today, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele <a href="https://x.com/nayibbukele/status/1762867369217532125?s=20">commented</a> on Bitcoin's recent price increase, stating "When Bitcoin’s market price was low, they wrote literally thousands of articles about our supposed losses. Now that Bitcoin’s market price is way up, if we were to sell, we would make a profit of over 40% (just from the market purchases), and our main source of BTC is now our citizenship program. We won’t sell, or course; at the end 1 BTC = 1 BTC (this was true when the market price was low and it’s true now); but it’s very telling that the authors of those hit pieces, the “analysts”, the “experts”, the “journalists”, are totally silent now."</p><p>El Salvador's bet on Bitcoin has appeared to pay off, not just from the perspective of their BTC investments increasing in value, but also from attracting large amounts of tourism from Bitcoiners and investment in the country. Other countries may be taking notice of what Bitcoin has done for El Salvador, and may want the same.</p><p>As Snowden's prediction garners attention, it underscores the growing mainstream recognition of Bitcoin's role in the global economy and its potential to reshape traditional financial systems.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NjcyNTY5ODk3Mzk1NTMx/f923soxb0aaua7x.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NjcyNTY5ODk3Mzk1NTMx/f923soxb0aaua7x.jpg"><media:title>f923soxb0aaua7x</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coinbase Crashes Following Bitcoin Pump, CEO Cites 'Large Surge Of Traffic"]]></title><description><![CDATA[CEO Brian Armstrong said the team is working to remediate the situation.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/coinbase-crashes-following-bitcoin-pump-ceo-cites-large-surge-of-traffic</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/coinbase-crashes-following-bitcoin-pump-ceo-cites-large-surge-of-traffic</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Brian Armstrong]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Coinbase]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2024 18:22:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTgyMzg4OTgxNjgwNDQ4NjQz/coinbase.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase, one of the leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges, experienced a significant outage today as Bitcoin's price soared, leaving many users accounts malfunctioning.

<p>Following the outage, Bitcoin sharply declined in price from ~$64,000 to ~$59,500, wiping out most of the gains Bitcoin had made today.

This means that the state is operating and acting in order to preserve and expand it’s own power. For that reason, it is sane and reasonable to assume that state operators are in the trenches of Bitcoin attempting to influence public perception, developer activity, and overall bitcoin adoption. If you think this is not happening then you are naive or you’re incentivized to act against bitcoin in a different way. The sabotage of Bitcoin is not some tin foil hat conspiracy, the sabotage of Bitcoin is actively playing out in real time, but the big question is where the sabotage is taking place and what can you do to identify and act to counter the sabotage?</p><p>So let’s zoom into Bitcoin of today, where conversation is happening around the future of Bitcoin in regards to dealing with Ordinals, or spam (if you are part of that camp)<sup><a href="https://orangelabel.co/the-sabotage-of-bitcoin/#3b6805ba-fbcd-4f46-af60-b817f360abfe">1</a></sup>. The rise of Ordinals last year and the pressure they have caused on blockspace demand has surfaced new rivalries within the bitcoin maximalist community as memetic warfare is waged on what bitcoin is and how it should be used. The purpose of this article <strong>is not</strong> to make a political stand in this fight, but <strong>to point out </strong>places in Bitcoin that are prone to sabotage and where active sabotage campaigns might be actively waged. Seeing this division in a once undivided front is enough to make one pause and consider what external forces are at work.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s Power Balance</h2><p>As we consider the infighting happening within Bitcoin, it is important to understand the different parties within bitcoin and how each of the powers balance each other out. In 2019, Nic Carter illustrated Bitcoin’s Power Balance Model. This model shows the key roles in Bitcoin and the relationship between each one. You can see the circular feedback loop between Miners -> Devs -> Economic Nodes. In a vacuum these three roles would perpetually pump each other with nothing to keep them in check. At the heart of the model are the Users who keep Devs and Economic nodes in check.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NjY4NDA4NjEwOTU2ODgw/group-105-1536x864.png" height="675" width="1200">

                    </figure>
                    <p>The one factor in the power model that touches each of the player in the model is the software of code. The software touches each of the roles in one way or another and this is probably the largest threat vector to all of Bitcoin. The simple activity of running code is how Bitcoin is eating the monetary world, so it is probably worth understanding the development process.</p><h2>Bitcoin Development Process</h2><p>Let’s now dig into the Bitcoin development process. As you know, making changes to Bitcoin is a slow and deliberate process. This is a big change from the “move fast and break things” mentality of Silicon Valley. Many argue that this slow methodical process is actually one of Bitcoin’s greatest strengths. In 2011, Gwern published <a href="https://gwern.net/bitcoin-is-worse-is-better">“Bitcoin Is Worse Is Better”</a> where he says “However, in an example of ‘Worse is Better’, the ugly inefficient prototype of Bitcoin successfully created a secure decentralized digital currency, which can wait indefinitely for success, and this was enough to eventually lead to adoption, improvement, and growth into a secure global digital currency.” This ugly inefficient code has gotten us here today, 15 years later, and in that time the slow methodical approach to Bitcoin development has been and will probably continue to be a part of the developer ethos.</p><p>The development process has even been formally documented in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0002.mediawiki">BIP 2</a> (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal). Here are the general steps in the BIP activation process:</p><ol><li><strong>Drafting the BIP</strong>: The first step is to draft a BIP following the template outlined in BIP2. This includes writing a detailed document or white paper that outlines the proposed changes. The BIP should be comprehensive, covering motivation, technical specifications, and rationale.</li><li><strong>Discussion and Feedback</strong>: Once the BIP is drafted, it’s shared with the Bitcoin community for discussion and feedback and usually happens on platforms like the Bitcoin Dev mailing list, GitHub, and even Twitter. The purpose is to solicit feedback, refine the proposal, and begin to build consensus around it.</li><li><strong>Assigning a BIP Number</strong>: If the BIP is deemed to have potential and is unique, it’s assigned a BIP number by a <strong>BIP editor</strong>. This is a formal acknowledgment that the BIP is under consideration.</li><li><strong>Formal Review</strong>: After the BIP is assigned a number, it enters a formal review phase. During this time, the BIP is scrutinized for technical soundness, feasibility, and compatibility with the Bitcoin protocol. This is where the devs try to break the bip and poke holes in the proposal.</li><li><strong>Revisions</strong>: Based on feedback and review, the BIP may undergo several revisions.</li><li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Once consensus is reached, the BIP is implemented in the Bitcoin Core codebase. This step involves actual coding and rigorous testing to ensure that the changes work as intended without introducing new vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Reaching Consensus</strong>: For a BIP to move forward, it needs to reach consensus among the Bitcoin development community. This is often the most challenging part, as Bitcoin’s decentralized nature means that a wide range of stakeholders (developers, miners, users, etc.) need to agree on the change.</li><li><strong>Deployment</strong>: After implementation & consensus, the new version of Bitcoin Core including the BIP is released. Depending on the nature of the BIP, it might require a majority of miners or nodes to upgrade to the new version for the changes to take full effect.</li><li><strong>Activation</strong>: Finally, once the required threshold of network participants has adopted the new version, the changes proposed in the BIP are activated on the Bitcoin network.</li></ol><p>Reading through this is incredibly helpful in understanding how change happens to Bitcoin. The problem I see is where are the single point of failures in this process and who the gatekeepers<sup><a href="https://orangelabel.co/the-sabotage-of-bitcoin/#e20a6c1d-a9e7-4feb-94ad-3e5e24e83f1e">2</a></sup> are for each step. Conversations happening in channels now are surfacing weak points or non documented parts of the development cycle. For example, Bitcoin Inquisition. This is the in space between steps 2 and 3.</p><h3>Bitcoin Inquisition</h3><p><a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020921.html">Bitcoin Inquisition</a> is a non-documented part of the Bitcoin development process. It was proposed by and administered by AJ Towns in 2022. Here is a very brief summary of why and what it is.</p><blockquote><p><em>“I think the weakest link in that [bitcoin development] loop is the first one: what if we did activate soft forks on the default signet prior to the code being merged into core? To that end, I’m proposing a fork of core that I’m calling <strong>“bitcoin-inquisition”</strong>, with the idea that it branches from stable releases of core and adds support for proposed changes to consensus (CTV, ANYPREVOUT, TLUV, OP_CAT, etc…) and potentially also relay policy (relay changes are often implied by consensus changes, but also potentially things like package relay).”</em><br><br><em>– AJ Towns on Bitcoin Inquisition</em></p></blockquote><p>The reality is that the Bitcoin Inquisition is live and well. AJ runs a special separate fork of Bitcoin core and acts as the sole admin for testing BIP’s. This is not documented in BIP-2, but has just been accepted as process by core devs. This is a curious development of how tribal devs can make changes how they see fit, without documentation.</p><h2>The Bitcoin Sabotage</h2><p>At this point we’ve run through the roles in Bitcoin, the steps in the development process, and even identified a glaring hole in the development process. Let’s now dig into what is sabotage.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Sabotage. (noun) /ˈsæb.ə.tɑːʒ/</strong></p><p>Definition: The deliberate destruction, damage, or obstruction of something, typically for political or military advantage. Sabotage is often carried out covertly and with the intention of hindering operations, activities, or plans of an opponent or competitor.</p><p><strong>Verb Form:</strong> Sabotage (sabotaging, sabotaged)</p><p><strong>Usage in a Sentence:</strong> “The bridge collapse was found to be the result of sabotage by enemy agents.”</p></blockquote><p>For purpose of this article, let’s frame sabotage specifically in relation to Bitcoin Sabotage. <strong>Bitcoin Sabotage is the deliberate destruction of Bitcoin, or obstruction of Bitcoin development or adoption, for political advantage.</strong> This is the frame. This is what we are up against. With that in mind let’s now dig into how sabotage is waged. Conveniently our very own CIA is masters at sabotage and have been waging sabotage tactics in warfare for over a century.</p><h3>Simple Sabotage Field Manual</h3><p>In the 1940’s, the CIA shipped a field manual called Simple Sabotage Field Manual. The purpose of this was to distribute to operators a practical manual on how to conduct sabotage operations behind enemy lines. While this manual is 80 years old, it reveals some classical tactics in the art of sabotage.</p><figure>
                        
                        <a href="https://orangelabel.co/simple-sabotage-field-manual/" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NjY4MzQ4NDgxNTQ1ODA4/simple-sabotage-manual.png" height="800" width="502"></a>

                    </figure>
                    <p>This “Simple Sabotage” is a unique look at how sly the military is when it comes to unconventional warfare. This manual was developed in the 1940’s and you have to wonder how many more hours and resources have gone into modernizing this same document and other classified operators manuals. For purpose of this article, we will examine the Specific Suggestions for Sabotage sections focused on Organizations and Conferences & Managers and Supervisors.</p><ol><li>Organizations and Conferences<ol><li>Insist on doing everything through “channels.” Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.</li><li>Make “speeches,” Talk as frequently as possible and at great length., Illustrate your points by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate patriotic” comments.</li><li>When possible, refer all matters to committees, for “further study and consideration.” Attempt to make the committees as large as possible – never less than five.</li><li>Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.</li><li>Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.</li><li>Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.</li><li>Advocate “caution.” Be unreasonable” and urge your fellow-conferees to be “reasonable” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.</li><li>Be worried about the propriety of any decision – raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated Hes within the jurisdiction of the group 01’whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.</li></ol></li></ol><p>When I read Section A. Organizations and Conferences, I can’t help but think that Bitcoin development is being sabotaged, but I am a naive outsider. I am also a noticer. If I was going to sabotage Bitcoin, this field manual could easily be deployed from within developer circles. If you were a state operator with developing skills, it is reasonable to believe you could begin participating in code review process and make in roads and start having authority in matters.</p><p>Let’s outline sabotage tactics state operators could be executing:</p><ul><li>Miners – in the great blocksize wars, some large mining pools signaled with the Big Blockers. This was an attack on Bitcoin, but it demonstrates a specific action that Mining Pool operators could carry out in order to sabotage Bitcoin. While this DID NOT work in breaking Bitcoin, we learned that Users are at the heart of Bitcoin. A bigger problem could be if large pool operators were acting in coordination with other roles.</li></ul><ul><li>Devs – this is perhaps the biggest vector for sabotage attack. As we see more value soaked up by Bitcoin, it will become a bigger target for state actors. That means we will have state operators submitting pull requests and participating in the development process. Based on the Simple Sabotage Field Manual, operators could easily carry out many of the tactics outlined above. We are already seeing very divisive positions from developers on how bitcoin should be, so you must wonder who is the operator.</li></ul><ul><li>Users – since users give feedback to developers, you would assume that giving bad feedback could lead to developers building something that is not in bitcoins best interest. Or users could socially attack developers into doing certain things. Right now we are seeing meme warfare being waged within the maximalist community, and it can’t all be organic discourse. Users infighting can lead to maldevelopment. Also, what happens if a group of bad actors in the users and developers camps are aligned. Or what if users coordinate to influence certain developers?</li></ul><ul><li>Economic Nodes – they choose what transactions make it to miners via the code they run. Users tell them what code to run because users spend money with them. Economic nodes could sabotage by supporting old code, or malicious sabotaged code.</li></ul><p>In wrapping up this piece, the complex dynamics between miners, devs, users, and economic nodes within Bitcoin creates a ripe battle ground for meme warfare and Bitcoin Sabotage. The Bitcoin development process is without flaws and as outlined in the CIA’s Simple Sabotage Field Manual, there are many simple to deploy tactics that could be used to sabotage Bitcoin. This should serve as a sobering reality that Bitcoin is under attack and you should act accordingly.</p><p>The responsibility is on you, humble frog, to keep your head on a swivel. You must stay aware and call out bullshit. Whether it is <a href="https://orangelabel.co/the-gaslighting/">combating gaslighting</a>, carrying out ethical trolling, or reviewing code, all these actions count and help preserve our only realistic shot at a more free future. The survival and flourishing of Bitcoin depend not just on NGU and its technological robustness but equally on the collective vigilance the users. As we navigate these uncertain times, let us be guided commitment to cypherpunk ethos, critical thinking, and unwavering support for the core principles that underpin Bitcoin which is freedom. In doing this, we might have a chance at winning the game of Bitcoin Sabotage and defeating our enemy, the state.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NjY4NDgyNjk5MTQyNzM2/spooks.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NjY4NDgyNjk5MTQyNzM2/spooks.jpg"><media:title>spooks</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NjY4NDA4NjEwOTU2ODgw/group-105-1536x864.png"><media:title>group-105-1536x864</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s Power Balance Model by Nic Carter <a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1156922274324369408">source</a>.]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0NjY4MzQ4NDgxNTQ1ODA4/simple-sabotage-manual.png"><media:title>simple-sabotage-manual</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[Click here to download your Spook handbook today!]]></media:description></media:content></item></channel></rss>
