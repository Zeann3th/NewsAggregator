										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">Solana</a>&#8216;s total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $4.666 billion, with a bridged TVL reaching just over $21 billion as of press time. This figure is distributed across dozens of protocols, each contributing to the burgeoning ecosystem in a unique way. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The distribution of value across protocols is an indicator of user preferences, emerging trends, and the fast-growing and evolving needs of the Solana community. Analyzing this distribution is crucial in understanding the direction the network is heading and its users&#8217; priorities:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/marinade-staked-sol/"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Marinade</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ($1.958b) is Solana&#8217;s leading liquid staking solution, allowing users to stake SOL and receive stSOL, enhancing liquidity and flexibility.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/jito/"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jito</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ($1.763b) accelerates Solana&#8217;s blockchain performance, focusing on scalability and efficient transaction processing.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kamino</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ($1.397b), a liquidity management platform, optimizes yield farming strategies, enhancing the DeFi experience.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Marginfi</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ($827.77m) integrates trading and lending into a single platform, offering diverse financial products.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/raydium/"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Raydium</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ($611.32m) is an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity provider built on the Solana blockchain for the Serum decentralized exchange (DEX).</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BlazeStake</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ($467.54m) focuses on staking solutions, offering users a way to earn rewards by securing the network.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/jupiter-ag/"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Jupiter</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ($383.4m) offers perpetual swap contracts, enabling leveraged trades without expiry dates.</span></li>
<li><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Drift</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ($336.49m) is a decentralized platform offering derivatives and leverage trading on Solana.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solend/"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Solend</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ($283.35m) is a decentralized protocol for lending and borrowing, showcasing the growth of lending markets on Solana.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/orca/"><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Orca</span></strong></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> ($270.2m) is a user-friendly DEX that emphasizes simplicity and accessibility in trading.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A closer look at the TVL distribution using <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">data</a> from DeFiLllama shows a clear inclination towards protocols offering liquidity and lending services, with </span>Marinade<span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span>Jito<span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span>Kamino<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> leading the pack. This indicates a robust demand for liquidity solutions and yield-generating opportunities among Solana&#8217;s users. It also reflects a growing sophistication in the DeFi space, where users seek more than just token swaps — they&#8217;re actively looking for platforms that can provide high leverage and a greater potential to earn.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the largest protocol in terms of TVL, Marinade reflects this increased interest in staking solutions, particularly those that provide high liquidity. By offering stSOL in return for staking SOL, Marinade addresses the liquidity dilemma often faced by stakers, allowing them to participate in DeFi activities without locking their assets.</span></p>
<p>Jito<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> and </span>Kamino<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> reflect a preference for scalability and optimized yield farming. Jito&#8217;s focus on increasing Solana&#8217;s throughput capabilities shows users are looking for a competitive edge in transaction efficiency. On the other hand, Kamino caters to yield farmers and their complex farming strategies, showing the community is gravitating toward more complex financial instruments than just swaps.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Comparing the popularity of lending protocols against decentralized exchanges (DEXs) shows lending platforms like </span>Solend<span data-preserver-spaces="true"> have amassed significant TVL. While it&#8217;s notably lower than the value locked in staking solutions, it shows a growing preference for lending. While Solana is still in its infancy, even in DeFi terms, this trend indicates a maturing space with a mature subset of users looking into leveraging their assets for loans or earning interest — a stark contrast to the earlier days of DeFi, where DEXs dominated the landscape. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The distribution of TVL across Solana&#8217;s protocols sheds light on a network that is becoming increasingly diversified. While <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/solana-ceo-anatoly-yakovenko-denounces-influx-of-racist-and-offensive-memecoins/">memecoins</a> have become a significant trend on Solana, their impact on TVL and its distribution seems minimal. As these tokens have a very short lifespan and are predominantly traded on DEXs, their transient nature means they contribute little to the stability or growth of Solana&#8217;s TVL. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> said that it will store a greater amount of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/usd-coin/">USDC</a> on its Base network on March 26.</p>
<p>Max Branzburg, Vice President of Product, announced the change on X. He <a href="https://twitter.com/maxbranzburg/status/1772716138499039612">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Going forward, Coinbase is going to be storing more corporate and customer USDC balances on Base.</span>&#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>Branzburg said the change will allow Coinbase to manage and secure customer funds with lower fees and faster settlement. He added that the change will not impact user experience.</p>
<p>Branzburg also urged other companies to follow Coinbase&#8217;s lead as it moves its business on-chain.</p>
<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s USDC breakdown</h2>
<p>Data from Arkham Intelligence <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/coinbase">indicates that</a> Coinbase currently holds $220.7 million of USDC in total and stores only 17% of it on Base — equating to $37.4 million.</p>
<p>Most of its USDC holdings — 155.1 million USDC, amounting to roughly 70% of the total — are currently held on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>.</p>
<p>Coinbase stores the remaining 13% of its USDC on various other chains, including $17.2 million on Arbitrum (7.8% of the total), $4.9 million on Avalanche (2.2%), $5.1 million on Optimism (2.3%), $1.0 million on Polygon (0.5%), and $38,557 on BNB Chain (0.02%).</p>
<figure id="attachment_407435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-407435" style="width: 1043px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-407435 size-full" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled.png" alt="coinbase usdc balance across networks" width="1043" height="600" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled.png 1043w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-300x173.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-1024x589.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Untitled-768x442.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1043px) 100vw, 1043px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-407435" class="wp-caption-text"><em>Coinbase USDC balance across networks (via. Arkham Intelligence)</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Shifting the balance</h2>
<p>As of March 26, there was $735.2 million in USDC natively on Base, plus $73.5 million of USDC bridged from Ethereum to Base.</p>
<p>Coinbase moving hundreds of millions of dollars in the stablecoin to the network could noticeably shift the chain&#8217;s overall USDC balance.</p>
<p>However, Coinbase&#8217;s USDC holdings are just a small fraction of USDC&#8217;s total $32.3 billion market cap, of which $27.2 billion exists on Ethereum. As such, shifts involving Coinbase&#8217;s USDC balance will not impact USDC&#8217;s broader Ethereum distribution in a significant way.</p>
<p>Coinbase previously had a key role in governing USDC through the CENTRE consortium. However, in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/circle-and-coinbase-to-dissolve-centre-usdc-will-remain-fully-available/">August 2023</a>, CENTRE was dissolved, passing governance to Circle.</p>
<p>Coinbase now holds a stake in Circle, and the two firms maintain a commercial relationship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of Republican lawmakers, including the chairmen of the House Financial Services Committee and House Committee on Agriculture, has formally requested SEC Chair <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/gary-gensler/">Gary Gensler</a> to provide clear guidance on the regulatory stance regarding the custody of non-security digital assets by Special Purpose Broker-Dealers (SPBD).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409210">March 26 letter</a> specifically demands clarity on the status of Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) and further requests the regulator to establish clear definitions for various terms related to crypto, digital assets, securities, and investment contracts.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by 48 members of Congress, including <span class="middlecopy">House Financial Services Committee chair <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/patrick-mchenry/">Patrick McHenry</a> and House Committee on Agriculture chair Glenn Thompson. Lawmakers asked for a response to their questions by April 9.</span></p>
<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s status</h2>
<p>According to the letter, the SEC has failed to propose a rule or provide comprehensive guidance for asset classification, and the term &#8220;digital asset securities&#8221; remains undefined.</p>
<p>Lawmakers said that despite a public record from both the SEC and the CFTC identifying ETH as a non-security digital asset, there is concern over the lack of transparency in the SEC&#8217;s SPBD regime and the potential regulatory implications of allowing such custody services.</p>
<p>The letter poses the question:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Is ETH a digital asset security?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The query is followed by several other questions depending on the answer.</p>
<p>The letter comes in the wake of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/prometheum/">Prometheum Inc.&#8217;s</a> announcement that its subsidiary — Prometheum Ember Capital, a FINRA-approved SPBD — plans to offer custody services for Ethereum to institutional clients.</p>
<p>They emphasized the &#8220;alarming scenario&#8221; posed by Prometheum&#8217;s announcement, arguing that it could lead to &#8220;irreparable consequences for the digital asset markets&#8221; if allowed to proceed under the current regulatory framework, which does not explicitly permit SPBD custody of non-security digital assets.</p>
<h2>Exacerbating the issue</h2>
<p>Highlighting the discrepancy between the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions and the historical recognition of ETH as a non-security digital asset, the letter criticized the SEC for not providing comprehensive guidance or rules for the digital asset marketplace regarding asset classification.</p>
<p>The lawmakers said that this lack of clarity has &#8220;exacerbated&#8221; the uncertainty within the digital asset ecosystem, complicating the ability of regulated entities to comply with SEC regulations.</p>
<p>The letter also highlights the broader implications of the SEC potentially classifying ETH as a digital asset security, including the impact on CFTC-registered commodity derivative exchanges and the availability of ETH Futures for trading.</p>
<p>Such a decision could have significant repercussions for market participants, potentially eliminating access to essential risk management tools and causing significant price dislocation across the ETH market.</p>
<p>The letter concludes by warning of the &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; on US digital asset markets should regulatory uncertainty persist, emphasizing the importance of clear and consistent regulatory guidance to ensure continued growth and innovation within the digital asset space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/galaxy-digital/">Galaxy Digital</a> CEO <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/mike-novogratz/">Mike Novogratz</a> shared an optimistic outlook for the future of crypto, specifically <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, in light of recent ETF approvals and the prevailing economic conditions.</p>
<p>Novogratz said during the company&#8217;s latest earnings that <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/galaxy-digitals-mike-novogratz-anticipates-a-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-by-january-10/">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> will continue to attract &#8220;boomer wealth&#8221; that will drive adoption to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the [Bitcoin] ETF, we&#8217;ve unleashed a new era, bringing the $80 trillion baby boomer wealth into the crypto sphere.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Novogratz added that the influx of new money into Bitcoin combined with several macro factors paints an optimistic picture of growth for the flagship crypto.</p>
<h2>Adoption drivers</h2>
<p>According to Novogratz, the US&#8217;s escalating national debt, now exceeding $34 trillion, and the anticipated Bitcoin halving event are pivotal macro factors that could significantly boost crypto adoption this year.</p>
<p>The executive emphasized the resilience and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-to-surge-in-6-months-as-investors-pivot-from-grayscale-to-new-etfs-galaxy-digitals-novogratz-says/">growing appeal of Bitcoin</a> against a backdrop of financial instability. Novogratz said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Until the United States and other countries get their finances in order, the narrative for Bitcoin and other digital assets will only become more compelling.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Novogratz further emphasized the role of the recently approved Bitcoin ETFs in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/proshares-seeks-to-add-more-bitcoin-etps-with-five-leveraged-and-short-etf-filings/">democratizing access</a> to crypto for a broader audience, particularly targeting the substantial wealth held by the baby boomer generation.</p>
<p>Despite the enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs, Novogratz also pointed out the ongoing regulatory challenges that the broader crypto market faces. He referred to the current state of affairs as a &#8220;regulatory tug of war,&#8221; especially for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The anticipation around the SEC decision on spot ether ETFs in May further highlights the uncertain regulatory landscape.</p>
<h2>IPO challenges</h2>
<p>Novogratz also touched on the company&#8217;s plans to go public and said the process has been &#8220;frustratingly slow&#8221; due to challenges with the SEC.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s cautious approach, prioritizing investor protection and market stability, often poses significant hurdles for crypto-related businesses aiming for public listing.</p>
<p>Novogratz&#8217;s frustration with the SEC&#8217;s slow pace is tempered by his anticipation of possible regulatory shifts that could emerge from changes in the Commission&#8217;s leadership and the broader political landscape.</p>
<p>With the upcoming presidential election, there&#8217;s a possibility of new appointments within the SEC, which could lead to a shift in regulatory stance towards more openness and efficiency in dealing with crypto-related applications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Portugal&#8217;s National Data Protection Commission (CNPD) said on <a href="https://www.cnpd.pt/comunicacao-publica/noticias/cnpd-suspende-recolha-de-dados-biometricos/">March 26</a> that it will ban <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/worldcoin/">Worldcoin</a> from collecting biometric data for three months.</p>
<p>The CNPD said that the limitations apply for 90 days until an investigation is concluded and a final decision is reached. The ban applies to biometric data on the iris, eyes, and face.</p>
<h2>Ban details</h2>
<p>CNPD imposed the ban for several reasons. First, Worldcoin allegedly has &#8220;no mechanism for verifying the age of members&#8221; and allegedly collected data from minors without parental permission.</p>
<p>Additionally, Worldcoin did not provide sufficient information to users on some matters, leaving users unable to delete their data or revoke consent.</p>
<p>CNPD said that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes special protections for both biometric data and minors. It also mentioned other possible violations of GDPR standards and said that all of these factors justified urgent intervention against Worldcoin.</p>
<p>Paula Meira Lourenço, President of the CNPD, called the new measures &#8220;an indispensable and justified measure&#8221; at the moment as they will protect the rights of the public and minors.</p>
<h2>Worldcoin denies wrongdoing</h2>
<p>According to a separate report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/sam-altmans-worldcoin-ordered-stop-data-collection-portugal-2024-03-26/">Reuters</a>, Worldcoin has denied any wrongdoing and claimed that it does not allow minors to register through the ORB.</p>
<p>Worldcoin Foundation&#8217;s data protection officer, Jannick Preiwisch, said Worldcoin is &#8220;fully compliant with all laws and regulations in its operating areas.</p>
<p>Preiwisch said that Worldcoin had not previously heard from the CNPD about the issues. He asserted that Worldcoin has &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; for registrations by minors and said the project is addressing the reports.</p>
<p>Worldcoin emphasized that it recently introduced a user-controlled <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-implements-personal-custody">Personal Custody</a> model, giving users greater control over their data. It initially announced the new model on March 22 as it released its Orb software under an <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/worldcoin-foundation-makes-orb-software-open-source/">open-source</a> license.</p>
<p>Spain also imposed a three-month ban on Worldcoin&#8217;s data collection activities on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/worldcoin-faces-three-month-data-collection-suspension-in-spain-wld-price-drops-10/">March 6</a> for identical reasons. The biometric data collection has raised concerns among regulators in several other countries as well, with Kenya labeling it &#8220;espionage.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Quick Take</h2>
<p>The latest Bitcoin cycle, starting from the lows of November 2022 at approximately $15,500 and soaring to over $73,000, is drastically altering investor expectations as it deviates from the traditional bull market patterns.</p>
<p>Historically, Bitcoin has seen 30% drawdowns in bull markets, which is a common occurrence. However, this cycle has left many investors on the sidelines, waiting in vain for the usual hefty drawdowns to happen.</p>
<figure id="attachment_407221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-407221" style="width: 1800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-407221 size-full" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bull-market.png" alt="Bull Market Correction Drawdowns: (Source: Glassnode)" width="1800" height="1013" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bull-market.png 1800w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bull-market-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bull-market-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bull-market-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bull-market-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-407221" class="wp-caption-text">Bull Market Correction Drawdowns: (Source: Glassnode)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The most significant drawdown of this cycle, a 20% dip, took place in September 2023, falling from $30,000 to $25,000 from its July peak.</p>
<p>Since October 2023, Bitcoin has embarked on an impressive climb, jumping from roughly $25,000 to a peak of roughly $73,000, but with two relatively modest drawdowns of 16%.</p>
<p>These occurred just after the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-falls-over-20-from-yth-high-with-further-5-drawdown-in-cascading-liquidation-event/">ETF launch in January</a> and again from the all-time high. Glassnode&#8217;s data captures the daily closing prices, indicating that the Bitcoin price may have dipped lower within the day.</p>
<p>However, the extent and duration of the drawdowns in this Bitcoin cycle have been notably shorter and shallower. This could be indicative of Bitcoin maturing as an asset.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Analysts believe <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could see a significant upswing following their launch in Hong Kong due to the adoption of in-kind creation models.</p>
<p>Bloomberg senior ETF analyst <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/eric-balchunas/">Eric Balchunas</a> further pointed out that Hong Kong&#8217;s adoption of an <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1772602019133423921?t=TeeRFMqlVVghAyl6b0xAGg&amp;s=19">in-kind creation model</a> for spot Bitcoin ETFs could potentially boost the assets under management (AUM) and the trading volume for ETF products in the rapidly expanding region.</p>
<p>Balchunas&#8217;s position was informed by a research note by Bloomberg ETF analyst Rebecca Sin, which suggested that the in-kind model would present an &#8220;opportunity for the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Sin:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hong Kong is aiming for in-kind creation of the ETF, unlike the US, where the transaction is cash only — in the US, it’s cash in, Bitcoin ETF out, while Hong Kong aims for Bitcoin in, ETF out. This could be an opportunity for the market.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, Hong Kong authorities signaled their <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/hong-kong-financial-regulators-are-prepared-for-spot-crypto-etf-applications/">readiness</a> to accept applications for spot crypto ETFs, with <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-etfs-expected-to-launch-in-hong-kong-by-mid-2024/">plans to roll o</a>ut these financial products by mid-year. Since then, multiple entities, including Harvest Hong Kong, have filed <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/harvest-hong-kong-leads-the-charge-with-hong-kong-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-report/">applications</a> to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<h2>In-kind vs. Cash creations</h2>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s potential adoption of the in-kind model approach starkly contrasts the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/approaching-the-launch-of-spot-bitcoin-etfs-strategies-for-redemption-and-market-impact/">cash-creation model</a> favored by US authorities for its spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>With in-kind redemptions, ETF issuers can exchange the fund&#8217;s underlying assets, such as Bitcoin, with market makers instead of transacting in cash during share creation and redemption. This mechanism enables the ETF to issue creation units without immediately selling the securities for cash.</p>
<p>In contrast, the cash redemptions <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/sec-rumored-to-be-instructing-spot-bitcoin-etf-applicants-to-include-cash-creates/">favored by the US SEC</a> require fund managers to sell Bitcoin to provide cash to redeeming shareholders.</p>
<p>Notably, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/blackrock/">BlackRock</a>, one of the Bitcoin ETF issuers, had <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/blackrock-warned-sec-lack-of-in-kind-orders-for-bitcoin-etf-shares-could-hurt-investors/">warned</a> that this method poses the challenge of maintaining share prices aligned with Bitcoin&#8217;s actual value.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu said the US criminal charges against the exchange will not affect the platform&#8217;s operational stability and assured users that their funds <a href="https://twitter.com/lyu_johnny/status/1772655006996398519?s=46&amp;t=aw6ZR-6aD050XLPVXY8AQA">remain safe</a>.</p>
<p>Lyu made the statement on social media after the US Department of Justice (DOJ) announced it is levying criminal charges against the exchange for flouting anti-money laundering (AML) laws.</p>
<p>Lyu said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Your assets are safe and sound with us. Our team and I will provide timely updates about the progress.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>KuCoin also made an <a href="https://twitter.com/kucoincom/status/1772649807972315170">official statement</a> regarding the allegations and said its lawyers are investigating the details. The exchange similarly assured users that funds are &#8220;absolutely safe.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Criminal Charges</h2>
<p>The US Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/prominent-global-cryptocurrency-exchange-kucoin-and-two-its-founders-criminally">announced</a> the indictment of KuCoin — along with its founders Chun Gan (known as Michael) and Ke Tang (known as Eric) — on charges of operating without the necessary legal permissions and failing to adhere to AML laws on March 26.</p>
<p>The indictment accuses the platform and its founders of bypassing the Bank Secrecy Act and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business.</p>
<p>US Attorney Damian Williams — who is leading the case — outlined the charges, stating that KuCoin and its founders allegedly avoided US regulatory measures despite having a substantial user base in the country.</p>
<p>The indictment criticizes KuCoin for not implementing essential AML policies, which purportedly allowed the transfer of over $9 billion in suspicious and illicit funds through the exchange.</p>
<p>The document also points out KuCoin&#8217;s late adoption of customer identification measures, which came into effect in July 2023 after the initiation of a federal investigation and did not retroactively apply to existing customers, including those in the US.</p>
<p>Additionally, the indictment alleges that KuCoin made efforts to conceal the presence of US customers on its platform and misrepresented this information to investors. The exchange is accused of promoting itself on social media as a platform where US users could trade anonymously.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the charges against the exchange&#8217;s two founders include conspiring to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business and to violate the Bank Secrecy Act, with potential maximum sentences of five years in prison for each charge.</p>
<p>KuCoin and its related entities face several charges, the most severe of which is a potential ten-year prison sentence for a substantive violation of the Bank Secrecy Act.</p>
<h2>Crypto commodities</h2>
<p>The indictment notably mentions that KuCoin violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) by failing to register with the CFTC despite allowing users to trade commodities on its platform.</p>
<p>According to the filing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are &#8220;commodities&#8221; under the CEA.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The filing does not specify the other cryptocurrencies and only mentions <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> in relation to the CFTC complaint. However, the indictment does mention <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/?s=Ethereum">Ethereum</a> in a different section that describes KuCoin&#8217;s spot trading activity.</p>
<p>DeFi Education Fund board member Jake Chervinsky <a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1772666739995595007?s=20">noted</a> that the accompanying CFTC complaint against KuCoin specifically labels three cryptocurrencies as commodities — Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.</p>
<p>The inclusion of ETH in the CFTC complaint is significant, considering <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-foundation-facing-inquiry-by-unknown-state-authority/">recent rumors</a> that the SEC is investigating the Ethereum Foundation to try and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ripple-leaders-forecast-sec-defeat-in-ethereum-security-saga/">label it a security</a>.</p>
<p>Chervinsky believes the inclusion implies the CFTC is directly challenging the SEC&#8217;s approach to investigating Ethereum and other digital assets. This development represents a notable departure from the usually discreet stance the agencies have taken in their jurisdictional overlap concerning crypto.</p>
<p>According to Chervinsky:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This may seem minor, but is actually pretty savage interagency drama by DC standards.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Quick Take</h2>
<p>Examining the relative forces between Bitcoin cohort accumulation and monthly issuance offers intriguing insights into the current market situation. The ongoing epoch witnesses daily mining of approximately 900 BTC, translating to nearly 27,000 BTC per month, represented as the blue line in our analysis graph.</p>
<p>The distinct cohorts are classified from shrimps (holding less than one Bitcoin) to super whales (10,000+ BTC), in addition to tracking miners and exchanges. The analysis becomes particularly interesting when the orange bar chart, representing the cohorts&#8217; aggregate accumulation, surpasses the blue line of monthly issuance.</p>
<p>However, when the orange bar chart falls below the monthly issuance line, it indicates that all cohorts are not accumulating the total monthly issuance on an aggregate basis.</p>
<figure id="attachment_407207" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-407207" style="width: 1800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-407207 size-full" style="color: #383838;" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/issuance-1.png" alt="All Cohorts vs Issuance: (Source: Glassnode)" width="1800" height="1013" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/issuance-1.png 1800w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/issuance-1-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/issuance-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/issuance-1-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/issuance-1-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-407207" class="wp-caption-text">All Cohorts vs Issuance: (Source: Glassnode)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Breaking down the data, as of March 25, the monthly issuance stands at 27,000 BTC, while the aggregate cohort accumulation has reached 43,114 BTC. Evidently, in the last 30 days, all cohorts have collectively absorbed the mined Bitcoin and have procured additional quantities from exchanges. This buying trend aligns with the recent surge of Bitcoin prices above the $70k mark.</p>
<p>Conversely, a contrasting period was observed between March 3 and March 22. Cohorts were accumulating less than the monthly issuance. This trend contributed to the dip in Bitcoin prices from its all-time high of $60k.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phenomenon of the Bitcoin halving is a cornerstone event in the crypto world, fundamentally altering the economic landscape for miners and investors alike. Occurring approximately every four years, this event reduces the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks by half, a mechanism designed to control the supply of Bitcoin and mimic the scarcity-driven value preservation seen in precious metals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we approach the next halving in 2024, the Bitcoin community keenly focuses on its potential impacts on the market and mining operations. In this shifting environment, </span><a href="https://gmt.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>GoMining</strong></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> emerges as a noteworthy entity, offering innovative solutions to the challenges posed by the BTC halving event.</span></p>
<h2><b>Economic Realities of Post-Halving Mining</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The halving event is not merely a technical milestone but a pivotal economic reset that impacts all facets of Bitcoin mining. By halving the block rewards, the event directly challenges the profitability and sustainability of mining operations, compelling miners to reassess their strategies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, each halving has led to a significant shakeout in the mining industry, with only the most efficient and strategically positioned miners able to maintain profitability in the face of reduced rewards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the post-halving landscape, miners face the dual challenge of decreasing rewards and potentially increasing competition as the market adjusts to the new reward structure. This environment favors mining operations that achieve the lowest operational costs, particularly in energy consumption, which is the largest variable cost in Bitcoin mining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the increase in mining difficulty, a measure of how hard it is to find a new block, is another critical factor that miners must contend with post-halving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the rewards decrease, maintaining the same profitability level requires more efficient hardware and access to cheaper electricity. </span><strong><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-au/technology/will-bitcoin-halving-in-2024-lead-to-the-next-all-time/469838">This situation</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leads to a natural selection process in the mining industry, where only the most efficient operations can thrive.</span></p>
<h2><b>GoMining&#8217;s Approach to Democratized Mining</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining presents a compelling solution for individuals across the spectrum of cryptocurrency familiarity, from seasoned mining enthusiasts to those new to the crypto world. It offers a seamless and efficient way to engage in Bitcoin mining, even in the face of the complexities introduced by post-halving scenarios. By providing an accessible platform, GoMining enables anyone to participate in mining activities and receive daily rewards without needing deep expertise in the intricacies of Bitcoin mining. This approach not only democratizes access to Bitcoin mining but also emphasizes the importance of efficiency and cost-effectiveness in a rapidly evolving space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining&#8217;s solution is built upon a unique </span><strong><a href="https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/12/how-liquid-bitcoin-hashrate-represents-mining-democratization-gominings-vision">Liquid Bitcoin Hashrate vision</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced by the company in 2022. According to this concept, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), also known as virtual miners, represent real shares of Bitcoin mining power generated by nine top-notch data centers operated by GoMining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This model democratizes access to mining and allows users to increase their mining capacity according to their investment strategy simply by acquiring or upgrading these NFTs. This approach eliminates the need for individuals to invest in expensive mining equipment or deal with the logistical challenges of setting up and running a mining operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another key aspect of the ecosystem is the </span><strong><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gomining-token/">GOMINING token</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which operates across both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks, facilitating a variety of actions, including purchasing and upgrading NFTs and managing digital assets within the platform. Users can also stake the GOMINING token to earn returns and gain voting rights, influencing platform decisions and contributing to the community&#8217;s direction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><strong><a href="https://medium.com/@GoMining/gomining-launches-vote-escrow-ve-tokenomics-1c3de4e3e02e">GoMining veTokenomics</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> framework is designed to increase its value over time through a deflationary model, incorporating burn and mint cycles that enhance its scarcity and utility.</span></p>
<h2><b>Operational Efficiency and Sustainability</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In anticipation of the challenges posed by the halving, GoMining is actively expanding its total hashrate and exploring innovative ways to enhance the energy efficiency of its operations further. The company&#8217;s roadmap includes significant investments in technology and infrastructure to enhance its mining capacity and maintain competitiveness in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining&#8217;s operations are designed to focus on energy efficiency and sustainability. The sustainability of mining infrastructure, especially during periods of market fluctuation, is heavily influenced by electricity costs. As such, the company strategically locates its data centers in regions with low electricity costs, significantly reducing one of the largest expenses associated with mining. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GoMining NFTs, also called digital miners, exemplify strategic planning in this aspect, having secured data center locations that grant them access to the most economically priced electrical resources worldwide. With an energy cost of merely $0.05 per kWh, they stand in stark contrast to the global averages, such as $0.44 per kWh in Britain, $0.17 per kWh in the United States, and $0.08 per kWh in both China and the United Arab Emirates, based on </span><strong><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/263492/electricity-prices-in-selected-countries/">Statista’s 2023 data</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mining firm also uses the latest and most energy-efficient mining hardware to ensure its operations have a minimal environmental footprint while maximizing user returns. Strategic partnerships with industry-leading players like </span><strong><a href="https://medium.com/@GoMining/gomining-announces-partnership-with-bitmain-39f45446deb7">Bitmain</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a BTC mining hardware manufacturer, and participation in the </span><strong><a href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/">Bitcoin Mining Council</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> significantly contribute to the company&#8217;s position at the cutting edge of the industry.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of Bitcoin mining post-halving requires innovation, efficiency, and adaptability. GoMining represents a forward-thinking solution that addresses the core challenges miners face today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By offering an accessible, scalable, and efficient model for Bitcoin mining, GoMining provides a valuable platform for individuals and entities looking to engage in mining without the traditional barriers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the mining landscape evolves, GoMining&#8217;s approach could serve as a blueprint for sustainable and profitable mining operations in the era of reduced block rewards.</span></p>
