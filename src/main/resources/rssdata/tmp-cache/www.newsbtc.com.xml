					<description><![CDATA[Jelle, a well-regarded crypto analyst, recently shared via the latest post on X that Bitcoin is on the verge of a significant upward movement, potentially reaching the $100,000 mark much sooner than many have anticipated. This optimistic prediction comes when Bitcoin has shown considerable resilience, bouncing back from various challenges and solidifying its position as a leading digital asset. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Pre-Halving Retrace Echoing Troubling 2020 Trend The Bitcoin Path To $100,000 Jelle&#8217;s assertion that Bitcoin is gearing up for a significant price rally to $100,000 is supported by recent market movements and the strategic positioning of investors within the ecosystem. The analyst&#8217;s confidence is rooted in observing Bitcoin&#8217;s market behavior, including establishing a new higher low and a push toward previous highs. Such patterns have historically preceded substantial gains for Bitcoin, making the $100,000 target seem increasingly attainable. The new higher low has locked in, and #Bitcoin is pushing back towards the highs. The next leg higher has started. $100,000 is a matter of time, imo. https://t.co/EA1TvcUlN5 pic.twitter.com/qt55a0Uy7f — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) March 26, 2024 This forecast is further bolstered by the market&#8217;s reaction to Bitcoin&#8217;s recent performance. Despite some volatility, the cryptocurrency has managed to reclaim and maintain a price point above $69,000. Mysterious Movements And Market Signals Adding to the intrigue surrounding Bitcoin&#8217;s potential surge is a mysterious on-chain activity involving one of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s dormant addresses. This address, the fifth richest Bitcoin wallet, suddenly sprang to life after years of inactivity, moving roughly $6 billion worth of Bitcoin. The transaction, executed over the weekend, divided the sum into smaller amounts distributed across new wallets. The 5th richest Bitcoin address just moved over $6 BILLION in BTC to three new addresses. 37X moved almost its ENTIRE BALANCE of 94.5K BTC ($6.05B) in the early hours of Saturday 23rd March, leaving only 1.4 BTC in the address. The 94.5K BTC had not been moved since 37X… pic.twitter.com/mAjpg0oqnD — Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) March 25, 2024 This activity has raised eyebrows within the crypto community, as large BTC wallets are typically linked to exchanges. Still, the lack of exchange-related activity and interactions with this particular wallet has led to speculation about its ownership and purpose. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Surges Past $71,000: 4 Key Reasons Behind The Rally However, BTC&#8217;s ability to sustain its price above $69,000 in the days following this activity indicates that whoever is responsible for this mysterious activity might not have made any sell move. Meanwhile, Analyst Rekt Capital has recently drawn parallels between the current market conditions and the pre-halving phase of 2020, suggesting that Bitcoin may be poised for a similar growth trajectory as witnessed in previous cycles.

<p>The first major support is $69,000. The next support sits at $68,500 and the trend line. If there is a close below $68,500, the price could start a drop toward the $67,000 level and the 100 hourly SMA. Any more losses might send the price toward the $66,000 support zone in the near term.</p>
<p>Technical indicators:</p>
<p>Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $68,500, followed by $67,000.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels – $70,500, $71,500, and $73,500.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Layer 1 (L1) blockchain platform Aptos has experienced a significant surge in key metrics, accompanied by a 12% price rally of its native token APT within the past 24 hours. On Tuesday, the token&#8217;s price approached its all-time high (ATH) level of $19,92, reaching above $19. APT Eyes $20 Milestone Despite the recent price correction across the broader cryptocurrency market, Aptos&#8217; APT token has been on an impressive uptrend since early March. Over the past 30 days, the token has surged by more than 94%, showcasing its strong performance. Aptos has also gained recognition in crypto, climbing to the 23rd position among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Currently valued at $7.3 billion, the token has experienced a substantial increase from the $4 billion recorded at the beginning of the month.  Related Reading: Ripple CEO Responds To SEC’s Shocking $2 Billion Demand The trading volume of Aptos (APT) has seen a significant surge, reaching $542,531,437 in the last 24 hours, a notable 90.70% increase from the previous day, according to CoinGecko data. Analyzing the daily APT/USD chart, no significant resistance levels are observed, indicating that reaching the $20 milestone may be within reach, which would mark a new all-time high for the token.  The sustainability of the bullish momentum and the ability of investors to hold on to their gains will play a key role in determining the coin&#8217;s future performance. Nevertheless, a possible retest of the next support level at $17.36 cannot be ruled out in the event of profit-taking and selling pressure. If the $17.36 support level fails to hold, the next significant support level for APT is at $16.31. However, it is important to note that APT&#8217;s bullish structure remains intact as long as the $12.14 support level remains unbroken, suggesting that the bulls currently have the upper hand as long as a sharp 30% decline does not occur. Aptos Attracts 11 Million Tokenholders In 30 Days Coupled with the increase in the price of its native token, Aptos has seen significant growth in key metrics over the past 30 days. According to Token Terminal data, token holders have grown significantly, increasing by 3.4% to 11.79 million individuals over the past 30 days.  Related Reading: Chainlink Facing Strong Rejection From Profit-Taking, Will CCIP Recharge Demand? In terms of fees generated, Aptos has seen a notable uptick. Over the past 30 days, fees generated were $209.16 thousand, representing a growth rate of 87.8%. Annualized fees reached $2.54 million, a slight increase of 0.2%. In a longer time frame, the Aptos token&#8217;s trading volume has experienced significant expansion, reaching $10.82 billion over the past 30 days, indicating a significant increase of 178.2%.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The positive Bitcoin Coinbase Premium that drove the latest rally above $70,000 has dissipated, suggesting buying has already slowed down. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Returned To Neutral Levels CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn explained in a post on X that the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has declined back toward the neutral line. The &#8220;Coinbase Premium Gap&#8221; here refers to a metric that keeps track of the difference between the BTC prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair). Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Returns To Extreme Greed As BTC Breaks $71,000 When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the price listed on Coinbase is greater than that on Binance right now. Such a trend implies that the buying pressure on the former is higher than that on the latter platform (or alternatively, the selling pressure on there is just lower). On the other hand, a negative value can imply the selling pressure on Coinbase is higher than on Binance as the price of the cryptocurrency listed there is lower. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past few days: The value of the metric appears to have been close to the neutral line recently &#124; Source: @JA_Maartun on X The chart shows that the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had taken to notably positive values as the latest upward push in the asset&#8217;s price had occurred. Since then, though, the metric has fallen, with its value approaching zero. It would seem that the buying pressure on the platform contributed to the surge. The fact that the rally has slowed since the metric returned to neutral levels may add further evidence. This isn&#8217;t unnatural for this year, however, as the Bitcoin price and Coinbase Premium Gap have shown a pretty tight relationship since the start of 2024. Coinbase is popularly known as the preferred platform of American institutional investors, while Binance hosts more global traffic. As such, the premium&#8217;s value provides insight into how the behavior of the US-based large holders differs from that of world users. Since the Coinbase Premium Gap has been the driver of the recent price surges, buying from these institutional entities could potentially have provided the fuel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top In Yet?

Given the close relationship the metric and BTC price have held recently, it may be worth keeping an eye on how things develop in the coming days. BTC may register some decline if the premium flips into the red from here. Naturally, a continuation of positive values would be a bullish sign instead. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around the $70,100 level, up more than 11% over the past week.

					<description><![CDATA[Chainlink (LINK) has performed strongly over the past week, with the token’s price increasing 21.3% in the last seven days. Some analysts have shared their predictions and thoughts on LINK, suggesting keeping an eye on the token and its long-term performance. Related Reading: Hold Onto Your Seats: XRP Primed For 90% Rally, According To Top Analyst What Is LINK’s Next Steppingstone? Recently, Chainlink announced its partnership with blockchain platform Avalanche and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group to connect the Avalanche and Ethereum blockchains using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). As reported by NewsBTC, the partnership aims to facilitate the “access, trade, and seamless settlement of tokenized assets across networks in different currencies in a process called Delivery vs. Payment (DvP).” The crypto community appeared to receive the news well. X users expressed their positive sentiments towards the collaboration and Chainlink’s token. The sentiment has seemingly translated to LINK’s performance, as the token’s price soared 9% in the last 24 hours. Crypto analyst and trader The Lord of Entry shared his prediction for LINK. In the X post, the trader highlights that the token’s performance in the past day had been strong as it broke above the $18.5 resistance level. Chainlink’s LINK unsuccessfully tested the resistance zone over the past week after falling below it on March 18. $LINK 4hr &#8211; #LINK has been strong today, but now banging into some resistance &#8211; if it can flip this into support your next big target is around 28#LINKusdt pic.twitter.com/YlCDRDOFTq &#8212; @TheLordofEntry (@thelordofentry) March 26, 2024 The token continued the upward trajectory throughout the day after successfully rising above the $18.5 price. In the early hours of Tuesday, LINK surged above the $20 mark but faced resistance near the $20.5 range. According to the trader, if the token can break above this level and turn it into a support zone, the next big target for LINK would be the $28 price range. As of this writing, LINK tested this new resistance level, which has been rising above it twice in the past hour. The token reached $20.6 in the first attempt and briefly surpassed the $20.7 price range during the second attempt. However, the token momentarily failed to flip the resistance zone and fell below $20.5 again. Chainlink’s “Very Strong” Long-Term Performance Despite the failed attempts, LINK’s price surged 9% in the past 24 hours. Interest in the token has seemingly risen in the same timeframe as its market activity increased by 55.19%, reaching a daily trading volume of $539.9 million. Its market capitalization also increased by 8.16% in the past day, reaching $12.02 billion. Chainlink is the 14th-largest cryptocurrency by this metric, according to CoinMarketCap data. Moreover, LINK has shown a remarkable 182.6% performance in the last year. As a result, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared some notes on LINK, suggesting that it shouldn’t be actively traded. Sherpa stated that the token is a better fit to “buy and hold” as it is a “safe coin that is going to do strong numbers.” $LINK: A few notes w. this one- -you shouldn&#39;t be actively trading this.

					<description><![CDATA[In the XRP lawsuit, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed its motion for remedies and entry of final judgment against Ripple, proposing a suite of penalties that includes injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits, and a notable $2 billion in civil penalties today. But that&#8217;s not the whole story as the 210-page document contains some interesting statements and assertions. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The @SECGov has filed its Motion for Remedies and Entry of Final Judgment, its Memorandum of Law in Support of that Motion, and its &#34;Proposed&#34; Judgment.https://t.co/uPlpJ7Tmon &#8212; James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) March 26, 2024 Did Ripple Favor Select Institutional Investors? One of the assertions made in the SEC document and pointed out by XRP community lawyer Bill Morgan was a key revelation that Ripple engaged in discriminatory pricing practices, offering substantial discounts on XRP tokens to a select group of institutional investors.

Related Reading: Top Analyst’s Bold Prediction: XRP Set To Skyrocket 1,500% XRP community lawyer Bill Morgan provided a summary of this aspect, highlighting the potential damage to Ripple&#8217;s standing in the eyes of institutional investors. &#8220;The SEC’s brief is a possible problem for Ripple beyond this case. The SEC is able to argue that there were two groups of institutional sales investors (it calls them favored and unfavored) and Ripple offered one group significant discounts in XRP price over the other group that did not receive them,&#8221; Morgan noted via X (formerly Twitter). He further delved into the SEC&#8217;s claim that such practices harmed the &#8220;unfavored&#8221; group of investors to the tune of $480 million, a figure based on assumptions that Morgan suggests need thorough examination. “The evidence of causation of this alleged harm seems thin,” he added. The SEC&#8217;s filing goes on to argue that Ripple&#8217;s sales tactics, specifically the discounted sales to certain investors, directly contributed to downward pressure on the overall market price of XRP. This point is not just a matter of regulatory compliance but also raises the specter of legal action from those institutional investors who may feel aggrieved by not being privy to the same discounts. Related Reading: Is Ripple Behind The XRP Price Crash? Massive Selling Spree Sparks Concern Morgan also touched upon the ramifications of these actions being classified as investment contracts by the SEC, saying, &#8220;As these sales to institutions were found to be investment contracts, it means that this offering of discounts to some but not other institutions is the very disclosure according to the SEC that should have, and would have been made to the institutions, if the sales to institutions had been registered.&#8221; He further noted that these claims by the SEC are also not great for the reputation of Ripple. “Not sure this revelation is great for Ripple’s reputation with institutional investors,” Morgan remarked. Ripple CLO Alderoty Responds Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, also issued a broad response to the SEC&#8217;s filing via X, vehemently disputing the narrative presented by the regulatory body. Alderoty stated, “Our response will be filed next month, but as we all have seen time and again, this is a regulator that trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead.” He further attacked the SEC for its illegitimate reasoning, stating: “They stayed true to form here. Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple &#8211; and the industry at large. We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.64365. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent development, Portugal&#8217;s data regulator, the National Commission for the Protection of Data, also known as the CNPD, has issued an order to stop Sam Altman&#8217;s iris scanning project, Worldcoin, from collecting biometric data for 90 days.  Worldcoin’s Compliance Under Fire According to a Reuters report, the CNPD&#8217;s suspension specifically targets the Worldcoin Foundation, a memberless entity based in the Cayman Islands, described on its website as the sole member and director of World Assets Ltd, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands responsible for issuing Worldcoin tokens to sign-up participants. The CNPD cited an alleged &#8220;high risk&#8221; to citizens&#8217; data protection rights as the main reason for its urgent intervention. The regulator expressed concerns about the “unauthorized” collection of data from minors, the lack of information provided to data subjects, and the inability to delete data or withdraw consent.  The halt order also noted that over 300,000 individuals in Portugal had provided their biometric data to Worldcoin, leading to numerous complaints being lodged with the CNPD. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Can Bulls Pump It Again To $0.75 Jannick Preiwisch, the data protection officer at the Worldcoin Foundation, responded to the CNPD&#8217;s order by stating that Worldcoin is “fully compliant” with all laws and regulations about biometric data collection and transfer. Preiwisch emphasized the company&#8217;s zero-tolerance policy for underage sign-ups and its commitment to addressing any reported incidents. Worldcoin has recently transitioned to &#8220;Personal Custody,&#8221; aiming to give users control over their data, including options for deletion and future use. The CNPD&#8217;s order to stop data collection is considered temporary, allowing for additional due diligence and analysis of complaints during the ongoing investigation. Privacy Storm Engulfs Worldcoin The Regulatory scrutiny of Worldcoin extends beyond Portugal. As NewsBTC reported, Spain&#8217;s data protection watchdog issued a three-month ban earlier this month in response to privacy complaints, and Kenya suspended Worldcoin&#8217;s operations in August 2023.  Moreover, the Bavarian State Regulatory Authority, acting as the lead authority in southeastern Germany, is currently investigating Worldcoin under European Union data protection rules due to the presence of a German subsidiary owned by Tools For Humanity, the company behind Worldcoin. As the investigation into Worldcoin&#8217;s data collection practices continues, the project faces significant challenges in addressing regulatory concerns and maintaining public trust in its ambitious vision. According to its website, the project claims to have garnered over 4.5 million sign-ups from individuals in 120 countries. Regulatory Hurdles Fail To Dampen WLD’s Performance Despite the recent regulatory challenges faced by Worldcoin, the decentralized cryptocurrency has managed to maintain its gains of 12% over the past seven days. After reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $11.95 on March 10, the project&#8217;s native token, WLD, experienced a sharp drop to $7.24 but has since recovered. Currently trading at $9.01, WLD has capitalized on the overall market rebound and its seven-day uptrend, surging by almost 9% in the past 24 hours.  The trading volume for WLD in the last 24 hours is $416,136,329, indicating a significant 65.10% increase compared to the previous day, suggesting renewed interest in the token. Related Reading: Crypto Outflows Reach New Record High, Will The Bitcoin Decline Continue? Looking ahead, the $9.5 level is expected to provide the nearest resistance for the WLD token, followed by the $10.14 mark, should the rally continue. On the downside, the $8.36 level is the closest support on the daily chart.  In a potential downtrend, failure to hold this support level could decline toward the $8 mark, with the next significant resistance at $7.93.

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent development, data from crypto analytics firm Glassnode shows that the amount of Bitcoin held on Coinbase has reached a 9-year low. This has raised the possibility of the flagship crypto rising to a new all-time high (ATH) of $75,000 soon enough.  BTC Held On Coinbase Drops Significantly  According to Glassnode, the Bitcoin balance on Coinbase dropped to a nine-year low of 344,856 on March 18. This suggests that Bitcoin investors are choosing to move their holdings off exchanges and hold for the long term rather than sell anytime soon. A move like this reduces the short-term pressure on Bitcoin and could spark an upward trend in BTC&#8217;s price.  Related Reading: Why Is The Price Of LUNC And USTC Up Today? Meanwhile, the drop in BTC held on Coinbase looks to be a trend, with data from market intelligence platform Santiment showing a drop in the total amount of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges (CEXs). This data is also supported by the fact that these exchanges have recorded more outflows than inflows lately.  Further data from Santiment also shows that the supply on exchanges as of March 22 stood at just over 836,000 BTC compared to the 18.82 million BTC that resides out of these CEXs. The decline in the number of BTC held on exchanges is undoubtedly a welcome development, considering how the flagship crypto token has recently been plagued with a wave of profit-taking.  Before now, the bearish sentiment surrounding BTC was further strengthened by JPMorgan’s theory that Bitcoin was overbought and that the crypto token could experience further price declines soon enough. However, with BTC back over $70,000, there is the belief that this is just the beginning of an upward trend that could see it reach new highs.  Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Net Inflows BitMEX Research revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined net inflow of $15.7 million on March 25. This represents a positive turn of events after these funds recorded negative flows throughout last week. The wave of profit-taking by these Bitcoin ETF investors contributed to the BTC dip that occurred during that period.  Related Reading: 7 Days Of Crypto: Key Events That You Should Keep An Eye On This Week The crypto community will no doubt keep their eyes on the flows recorded by these Spot Bitcoin ETFs this week as they could give an idea of whether or not the outlook towards BTC has become bullish again. These Bitcoin ETFs now play a prominent role in the Bitcoin ecosystem, considering how much BTC these fund issuers accumulate whenever there is a high demand for them.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $70,700, up over 5% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.
