					<description><![CDATA[Following a week of net outflows, the spot Bitcoin ETF market has rebounded with impressive net inflows this week, highlighting a growing investor confidence in Bitcoin and its associated financial products. This week&#8217;s market activities have shown a remarkable reversal from the previous 5-day net outflow streak, with Tuesday witnessing a substantial net inflow of $480 million, followed by $243.5 million on Wednesday. Yesterday‚Äôs resurgence in investor interest was notably boosted by Blackrock&#8217;s massive inflow of $323.8 million, effectively offsetting Grayscale GBTC&#8217;s $299.8 million outflows. Moreover, Ark Invest‚Äôs ARKB reported its best day yet, with $200 million in inflows, despite Fidelity experiencing its worst day with a mere $1.5 million in outflows. Nevertheless, Fidelity managed to bounce back with significant inflows of $261 million and $279 million on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.

					<description><![CDATA[XRP enthusiasts are in a frenzy after prominent community figure Chad Steingraber proposed a scenario where an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) could trade at a staggering 100x premium. Steingraber, a seasoned game designer, laid out his thoughts in a recent post, igniting discussions about the potential trajectory of an XRP ETF, particularly in light of the ongoing push for institutional adoption of the altcoin. Related Reading: Hold Onto Your Seats: XRP Primed For 90% Rally, According To Top Analyst Targeting A $500 XRP ETF Share Price Steingraber&#8217;s speculation centers around the price at which an XRP ETF&#8217;s shares might trade. His hypothesis hinges on the crypto reaching an unprecedented price of $5 per coin. In this scenario, he theorizes that the corresponding ETF could soar to equally unprecedented heights, potentially reaching a solid $500 per share. The actual underlying asset price does NOT have to skyrocket. The fund can trade at MASSIVE Premiums. Let‚Äôs say #XRP breaks ATH @ $5, its ETF fund could literally trade at 100x premium if the institutional demand kicks in.

He cites the Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTCN) as a prime example. Similar to his proposed XRP ETF, LTCN trades at a significant premium over Litecoin&#8217;s current market price. Despite Litecoin hovering around $95, investors in LTCN are currently paying a premium of over $250 per Litecoin equivalent within the trust. Can Arbitrage Opportunities Emerge? The prospect of such a high premium has sparked discussions about potential arbitrage opportunities. X user Zack, in response to Steingraber&#8217;s post, questioned whether individuals holding XRP could exploit this price disparity. Steingraber acknowledged the possibility, particularly if the issuing ETF allows for in-kind deposits, where investors can directly exchange their token for ETF shares. XRP market cap currently at $34 billion. Chart: TradingView.com However, he cautioned that in-kind deposits are still a rarity in the ETF market. While Steingraber expressed optimism about the future adoption of this practice, its absence presents a hurdle for immediate arbitrage opportunities.

They believe such a product would significantly bolster the value of XRP by increasing its accessibility to institutional investors. XRP up in the last seven days. Source: Coingecko A Speculative Outlook With Underlying Uncertainties It&#8217;s crucial to remember that Steingraber&#8217;s vision is entirely speculative.

<p>The main resistance is still near $71,500. If there is a clear move above the $71,500 resistance zone, the price could continue to gain strength. In the stated case, the price could even clear the $72,500 resistance zone in the near term.</p>
<h2>More Losses In BTC?</h2>
<p>If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $71,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $69,200 level and the trend line.</p>
<p>The first major support is $68,400. The next support sits at $67,500. If there is a close below $67,500, the price could start a drop toward the $66,000 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $66,000 support zone in the near term.</p>
<p>Technical indicators:</p>
<p>Hourly MACD ‚Äì The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) ‚Äì The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels ‚Äì $68,400, followed by $67,000.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels ‚Äì $70,000, $71,500, and $73,500.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[BlackRock, one of the largest asset managers globally, has witnessed notable success with its newly launched tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL. The fund, which records shared ownership on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, has attracted over $160 million in just one week since its debut.¬† BlackRock&#8217;s BUIDL Fund According to a Bloomberg report, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) primarily invests in cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. The fund rewards its holders with a cryptocurrency, BUIDL, valued at $1 per token.¬† Shareholders can transfer these tokens to other validated addresses using digital wallets approved by Securitize, BlackRock&#8217;s partner for the investment vehicle. The tokenized fund serves several key use cases, including treasury management for crypto companies, support for derivatives of Treasury bills, and acting as collateral for borrowing and trading, thus providing an alternative to stablecoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‚ÄúLiquid Inventory Ratio‚Äù Hits All-Time Low, What It Means It is worth noting that Securitize Markets, an SEC-registered alternative trading system, plays a critical role in facilitating the transfer of tokens between market participants.¬† While the SEC has recently increased its scrutiny of Ethereum&#8217;s native token, ETH, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo emphasizes that the investigations should be separate from the underlying blockchain infrastructure. Domingo also highlights the battle-tested nature of the public Ethereum blockchain, which provides a &#8220;robust foundation&#8221; for tokenization activities. As previously reported by our sister website, Bitcoinist, BlackRock has emerged as an advocate for cryptocurrencies and tokenization within mainstream financial institutions. Chairman and CEO Larry Fink believes every financial asset will eventually be tokenized.¬† The company&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has already attracted more than $13 billion in inflows since its launch as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) in January. With the BUIDL fund&#8217;s launch, BlackRock continues to demonstrate its willingness to explore new digital asset solutions. Ondo Finance To Transfer $95 Million In Assets To BlackRock Ondo Finance, a platform specializing in tokenized real-world assets (RWA), has moved¬†$95 million worth of assets to BlackRock&#8217;s BUIDL fund. This strategic move enables Ondo Finance to facilitate instant settlements for its US Treasury-backed token, OUSG.¬† This makes Ondo Finance a major participant in the BUIDL ecosystem. According to on-chain researcher Tom Wan, it currently holds $15 million worth of BUIDL tokens, which, in addition to those above $95 million, will result in a substantial $110 million worth of BUIDL tokens.¬†¬† Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7 The researcher noted that this collaboration further strengthens the tokenized US Treasury market, with the potential to reach $1 billion in value. In its announcement, the team behind the Ondo Finance platform summarized: We‚Äôre excited to see BlackRock embracing securities tokenization with the launch of BUIDL, especially its broad cooperation with ecosystem participants. Not only does this further validate our original concept of a tokenized US Treasury fund, but it also bolsters our thesis that tokenization of traditional securities on public blockchains represents the next major step in the evolution of financial markets. At the time of writing, the native token of Ondo Finance, ONDO, is trading at $0.909, exhibiting a surge of over 4% within the past 24 hours.

					<description><![CDATA[This Friday, the spotlight is turned to Deribit, the leading crypto derivatives exchange, as it gears up for a notable event in its trading history. Particularly, the exchange is poised to witness the expiration of over $9.5 billion in Bitcoin options open interest. For context, Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled or closed. It represents the number of contracts market participants hold at the end of each trading day.¬† This surge in open interest recorded by Deribit reflects increased market participation and signals heightened liquidity, marking a notable milestone in the crypto derivatives landscape. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚ÄòNext Leg Higher Has Started,‚Äô Says Analyst: Reveals $100,000 Target On The Horizon Record-Breaking Open Interest Notably, this event is significant in two ways: It underscores the growing interest in Bitcoin as an asset class and highlights the increasing ‚Äúsophistication‚Äù of the cryptocurrency market. This is because Open interest can also serve as a critical indicator of market health and trader sentiment.¬† As such, the record levels of open interest set to expire on Deribit suggest a ‚Äúvibrant‚Äù trading environment, with more investors engaging in complex financial instruments like options. According to Deribit data, the exchange is set to host one of its largest option expiries ever, with $9.5 billion worth of Bitcoin options poised for expiry at the end of the month. This figure represents a substantial portion, approximately 40%, of the exchange&#8217;s total options open interest, which stands at $26.3 billion.¬† The magnitude of this expiry event eclipses previous months, with January and February end-of-month expiries totaling $3.74 billion and $3.72 billion, respectively. This trend indicates a large increase in market activity and investor engagement on the platform. Implications Of The Bitcoin Expiry The upcoming expiry has notable implications for the market, especially considering the current pricing dynamics of Bitcoin. With Bitcoin&#8217;s spot price hovering below $70,000, an estimated $3.9 billion of the open interest is expected to expire &#8220;in the money,&#8221; according to Deribit analysts, presenting profitable opportunities for holders of these options contracts.¬† The &#8220;max pain&#8221; price, which represents the strike price at which the highest number of options would expire worthless, thereby causing the maximum financial loss to option holders, is identified at $50,000. According to the analysts, this scenario suggests that a significant number of traders are positioned to benefit from the current market conditions, potentially leading to ‚Äúincreased buying activity‚Äù as these options are exercised. Additionally, Deribit analysts speculate that the high level of &#8220;in-the-money expiries&#8221; could exert upward pressure on Bitcoin&#8217;s price or amplify market volatility. They added that as traders &#8220;hedge their positions&#8221; or &#8220;speculate on future price movements,&#8221; the market may witness a flurry of activity, impacting Bitcoin&#8217;s price trajectory in the short term.

					<description><![CDATA[Layer 2 (L2) blockchain Mantle (MNT) has demonstrated remarkable performance, surpassing most of the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the market. The token has surged by 40% in the past 24 hours, reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $1.49.¬† Mantle Network&#8217;s Layer 2 Solution Mantle Network operates as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible L2 scaling solution to provide a deeper understanding of the protocol. It leverages Optimistic rollups to enable fast and cost-effective transactions.¬† The unique aspect of Mantle lies in its modular design, which combines Optimistic rollups with a separate data availability layer. Unlike traditional blockchains, Mantle&#8217;s approach involves handling the four key blockchain functions on different layers. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs Why The Cardano Price Is Struggling Below $0.7 Mantle&#8217;s transaction execution function occurs on its EVM-compatible execution settlement layer. Blocks are generated on the L2 execution layer by Mantle&#8217;s sequencer, which then submits state root data to the Ethereum mainnet.¬† This architecture significantly reduces transaction costs compared to the base layer and improves network efficiency by separating the layers. Additionally, the implementation of Optimistic rollups minimizes the overall load on nodes. MNT Surges As Staking Launches One of the potential catalysts behind the recent surge in MNT can be attributed to the introduction of MNT staking, as highlighted by crypto researcher Alex Wacy.¬† According to Wacy, the Mantle Rewards Station plays a key role in this staking initiative, offering rewards to MNT stakers from the Mantle Ecosystem. By participating in staking, users contribute to the network&#8217;s security and operations while also being incentivized through these rewards. The staking process begins with the Ethena event, where users receive mShards tokens. These tokens have value within the Mantle decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, allowing users to perform various decentralized finance activities within the network.¬†These activities may include trading, investing, or interacting with various DeFi protocols and applications built on top of Mantle. In particular, mShards can be traded within the Mantle decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem, allowing users to take advantage of potential market growth options. The ability to trade these tokens increases liquidity and fosters an active ecosystem within Mantle. In addition, the researcher notes that mShard token holders will soon be able to redeem for ENA, another token associated with the Mantle Ecosystem. This redemption process adds utility and value to mShards, further increasing their appeal to token holders. The issuance of Ethena shards for Epoch 2 will end on April 1, indicating a limited-time opportunity for users to acquire these shards through staking, which may have further increased interest in the blockchain ahead of the deadline from investors looking to capitalize on this opportunity.¬† Bullish Prospects Examining the figures, MNT has experienced a surge in trading volume, reaching $647,118,249 in the past 24 hours, signifying a substantial 141.40% increase compared to the previous day.¬† Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Break $74,000 Driven By TradFi FOMO? The market capitalization of the MNT token stands at $4,157,261,742, propelling it to the 33rd position on CoinGecko&#8217;s rankings. Over the past 7 days, Mantle (MNT) has outperformed the global cryptocurrency market, which has seen a 2.30% increase, and similar cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum ecosystem have risen by 12.70%. The MNT token has retraced to the $1.27 level, marking a 2% decline in price over the past hour. Despite the temporary setback, the token&#8217;s strong momentum suggests potential trading risks and opportunities. It is worth noting that the next identified support line for the token is at the $1.080 level. If this support level fails to hold, the token&#8217;s price could drop further, potentially reaching the $1 mark. The next significant resistance level would be at $0.94.¬† However, if the bullish momentum continues throughout the week, the token may target the $1.60 and $1.68 levels before potentially surging towards the $2 mark.
