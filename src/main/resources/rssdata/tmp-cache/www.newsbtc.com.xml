					<description><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has experienced a notable resurgence in its bullish momentum, with a rebound of over 9% in the past 24 hours. This notable performance has outpaced the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization. The latest surge in SOL&#8217;s price has allowed it to surpass its resistance level on the daily chart at $184. The remaining hurdle of $201 now stands as the final barrier to prevent further gains for the cryptocurrency.  However, industry experts and crypto analysts suggest that SOL&#8217;s price action indicates a potential continuation towards its previous all-time high of $259, achieved during the market&#8217;s bullish run in November 2021. SOL  Price Expected To Breakout And Target All-Time Highs One analyst, &#8220;Jelle,&#8221; highlights SOL&#8217;s successful transformation of the last significant resistance level into support, suggesting a positive outlook for the token&#8217;s future. The analyst predicts that the SOL price will continue to rise and potentially exceed $250 by the summer. Related Reading: Bitcoin is “Overheating” For The First Time Ever Before Halving Similarly, another analyst using the pseudonym Mikybull points out that SOL is currently consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern on a daily timeframe.  According to the analyst, a breakout from this pattern is expected to trigger an “explosive” price movement, aiming to reach its previous all-time high levels at around $255. Supporting SOL&#8217;s renewed bullish momentum, CoinGecko data reveals a significant increase in trading volume, with $4,514,426,127 traded in the last 24 hours. This represents a 74.20% surge compared to the previous day, indicating a notable surge in market activity.  Solana Metrics Demonstrate Growing Investor Interest  According to data from Token Terminal, Solana&#8217;s key metrics further highlight the use and adoption of its blockchain among investors. Starting with market capitalization, the fully diluted market capitalization is $99.32 billion. This figure represents the total market value if all tokens were in circulation. The fully diluted market capitalization over the past 30 days has increased by 70.0%.  On the other hand, the circulating market cap, which only considers the tokens currently in circulation, is valued at $77.05 billion. It has witnessed a 30-day growth of 71.3%. Examining fees generated through transactions on the Solana network, the 30-day fees amount to $51.46 million. This represents a notable surge of 220.7% within 30 days, highlighting increased network usage and demand. When annualized, the fees reach $626.15 million.

The 30-day revenue is $25.73 million, reflecting a significant increase of 220.7% over the past month. When annualized, the revenue amounts to $313.08 million, showing the sustainable income generation within the Solana network. It remains to be seen if these metrics and bullish momentum will sustain SOL&#8217;s path to its current all-time highs. Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market recently witnessed significant liquidations, totaling over $200 million, as Bitcoin surged past the $69,000 mark. The Bitcoin price surge led to many short positions being liquidated, causing notable financial repercussions across various trading platforms. Bitcoin&#8217;s Sudden Rebound And Liquidations The data from Coinglass provide a clearer picture of the impact, showing that around 60,388 traders and counting faced losses exceeding $200 million in just 24 hours. The distribution of these liquidations varied among the major exchanges, with OKX traders experiencing the highest losses at $81.19 million, narrowly surpassing Binance&#8217;s $80.40 million in liquidations. Bybit and Huobi also reported significant figures of $18.98 million and $17.05 million in liquidations, highlighting the widespread effect of Bitcoin&#8217;s unexpected rally. The resurgence of Bitcoin to over $69,000 was particularly noteworthy, given its position below $66,000 in the early hours of Monday. While the exact catalyst for this abrupt rise remains uncertain, it puts Bitcoin a few dollars in value away from reclaiming its previous all-time high of $73,000. Analysts and traders are now closely watching the market for signs of Bitcoin’s next move, with speculation about the potential for new record highs in the near term. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin Bullish Prospects Crypto analyst Cryptoyoddha has provided an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin&#8217;s future, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is on the cusp of entering a new phase of its cycle that could see it reaching unprecedented heights. According to Cryptoyoddha, Bitcoin&#8217;s historical pattern of accumulation, followed by a parabolic surge, sets the stage for what he terms “Cycle IV,” a period that could potentially elevate Bitcoin’s value to $150,000 or more. According to the analyst, factors such as increased institutional investment, evolving regulatory clarity, and growing public acceptance of digital assets are key drivers of this bullish sentiment. #Bitcoin The real pump will start after the halving next month. pic.twitter.com/eV5FWkzkxX — Yoddha (@CryptoYoddha) March 23, 2024 Meanwhile, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra recently updated their forecast for Bitcoin&#8217;s year-end price, elevating it from an initial $80,000 to $90,000. This adjustment was prompted by notable factors such as the robust inflow into Spot Bitcoin ETFs and earnings from mining activities, which have contributed to a more optimistic outlook on Bitcoin’s valuation. Additionally, they maintained that Bitcoin is on track to reach $150,000 by mid-2025, attributing this anticipated growth to several elements, including the impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which they expect to drive a significant upswing in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price.

Moving beyond their original estimate of $100,000, the institution now suggests that Bitcoin could ascend to $150,000 by year&#8217;s end, citing the catalytic role of Bitcoin ETFs in fostering their positive outlook on the asset’s future performance.

<p>If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $71,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $70,000 level.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[According to a recent announcement from blockchain platform Avalanche (AVAX), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) has partnered with Chainlink (LINK) Labs to explore the potential of on-chain digital assets for global movement and settlement.  Using Chainlink&#8217;s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), the collaboration aims to connect the Avalanche and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains to enable uninterrupted delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement of tokenized assets across networks in multiple currencies. Tokenized Asset Transaction Across Avalanche And Ethereum Using Chainlink ANZ, a provider of banking products and services to millions of customers in nearly 30 markets, has reportedly taken an unusual approach to exploring the world of on-chain digital assets.  By leveraging Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP, ANZ is validating how customers can access, trade, and settle tokenized assets across multiple networks and currencies using Delivery vs. Payment. This approach aims to improve settlement efficiency and risk management for digital assets that fall under the classification of &#8220;securities&#8221; and their transactions. Related Reading: Social Media Storm Gives Dogecoin 14% Price Boost – Details According to Avalanche, Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP has been &#8220;crucial&#8221; in abstracting the complexities of moving tokenized assets across various blockchains, ensuring “atomic” cross-chain Delivery vs. Payment settlement.  Notably, within the collaboration, ANZ simulated a transaction where a customer used ANZ&#8217;s Digital Asset Services (DAS) portal to purchase tokenized ANZ-issued New Zealand dollar stablecoins (NZ$DC) on Avalanche.  Subsequently, the customer purchased tokenized Australian nature-based assets issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), denominated in tokenized ANZ-issued Australian dollar stablecoins (A$DC), on Ethereum.  Furthermore, ANZ facilitated the FX conversion between the two currencies, while CCIP provided the necessary infrastructure to transfer tokens and data between Ethereum and Avalanche. ANZ Harnesses Avalanche&#8217;s Evergreen Subnet Monday&#8217;s announcement also revealed that ANZ used its Avalanche Evergreen Subnet for the project, leveraging its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, permissioning, and custom gas token features.  The Evergreen Subnet allowed ANZ to explore new use cases and business models using customizable networks like Avalanche. ANZ&#8217;s collaboration with Chainlink and Avalanche showcases how traditional financial institutions embrace blockchain technology to enhance capital markets.  Ultimately, Avalanche revealed that the initial results of the test transactions were promising, and the initiative could change how the financial services industry approaches tokenized assets.  The next steps include deploying the solution on blockchain mainnets and extending the workflows to include communication between different blockchain networks for different use cases. AVAX Nears 22-Month High  At the time of writing, Avalanche&#8217;s token AVAX has been on a steady uptrend, resulting in a remarkable increase of over 60% in the last 30 days. Currently, the token is trading at $58.31, just below its 22-month high of $65 set on Monday the 18th. Within the last 24 hours, AVAX experienced a 9% increase after the announcement of the collaboration with Chainlink and ANZ Group. This surge allowed the token to break through the $55 resistance level. However, the $60 level is expected to be another obstacle that could lead to a consolidation period between $55 and $60 should the bullish momentum fade. Related Reading: Why Is The Price Of LUNC And USTC Up Today? Further demonstrating the interest in AVAX, the token&#8217;s trading volume in the last 24 hours reached $1,135,122,192, indicating a significant increase of 127.20% compared to the previous day.  Featured image from Shutterstock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH) stands at a crucial juncture, with its eyes set on the $4,000 price mark. Amid this ambitious pursuit, the digital asset faces a significant challenge that could influence its trajectory: scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite this potential regulatory hurdle, some analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum&#8217;s prospects. A detailed analysis by Captain Faibik, a market watcher, highlighted a bullish pattern in ETH’s four-hour candlestick chart, suggesting that the $4,000 threshold is within reach. Related Reading: Market Alert: Ethereum Faces Potential Downfall As Dencun Upgrade Looms – Here’s Why Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Milestone This optimism stems from a descending wedge pattern observed by Faibik, indicating an end to Ethereum&#8217;s consolidation phase and signaling a possible price breakout. The technical analysis paints a promising picture for Ethereum, suggesting that the asset could reclaim its lost valuation. $ETH #Ethereum Descending Broadening Wedge Upside Breakout is Confirmed on the 4hrs timeframe Chart..✅ $4,000 incoming ⌛️📈 https://t.co/qrKE5jiXon pic.twitter.com/MLIXefVsd8 — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) March 25, 2024 However, the recent market conditions have posed challenges for Ethereum, with the asset experiencing a more than 15% drop over two weeks, further exacerbated by the broader Bitcoin market correction. This decline saw ETH trading below the $3,500 mark, with a significant dip to $3,070 on March 20, amid reports of the SEC&#8217;s increasing interest in classifying Ethereum as a security. Particularly, reports indicate that the commission has been seeking financial records from US companies engaged with the Ethereum Foundation, intensifying the debate over Ethereum&#8217;s classification. Such regulatory scrutiny casts a shadow over Ethereum&#8217;s path to $4,000, introducing uncertainty into its future. ETF analyst James Seyffart suggests that the SEC&#8217;s stance could lead to the denial of spot Ethereum ETF applications by May 23, 2024. He cites a lack of engagement on Ethereum specifics, contrasting with the approach taken for Bitcoin ETFs. My cautiously optimistic attitude for ETH ETFs has changed from recent months.

An upsurge in network activity typically indicates heightened demand, a positive sign for Ethereum&#8217;s price potential. From January 3, the number of daily active Ethereum addresses surged by over 46%, coinciding with a significant price rally. This increased activity and price appreciation period highlights Ethereum&#8217;s resilience and potential for growth, even in the face of regulatory uncertainties. As Ethereum navigates through these regulatory and market challenges, the coming weeks will be critical in determining its ability to breach the $4,000 mark. The juxtaposition of technical bullish signals against the backdrop of SEC scrutiny presents a complex scenario for ETH.

					<description><![CDATA[Jupiter (JUP) has had a remarkable month, with its price skyrocketing over 150% in the last 30 days.

The token’s performance this month showed sideways price action before climbing to a new support level twice, which could suggest that another price surge is possible despite the turbulent week.

The chart shows that the consolidation phase started after the token’s price jumped and unsuccessfully tested the $1.50 resistance level on March 16. After a pullback to the $1.20 mark, JUP retested the resistance zone again on March 18, briefly reaching $1.60, but ultimately failed to maintain it. Following the unsuccessful attempts to climb, the price dipped even lower to the $1.10 support zone in the following days. Since then, JUP has bounced back, hovering between the $1.15-$1.25 zone. The recent price consolidation looks “ok,” according to the analyst. He further highlights Bitcoin’s current stability, seemingly suggesting to Sherpa that JUP could repeat its March trajectory. As a result, the analyst deems this moment as a “decent entry spot” for Jupiter’s token. Additionally, he has shown a positive sentiment towards JUP before, calling the token a “winner” that’s “gonna keep on winning.” winners gonna keep on winning. $PYTH and $JUP are some of the great ones. pic.twitter.com/nL4BmzxFJo &#8212; Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) March 16, 2024 JUP’s Price Action Recently, JUP’s Community showed some concerns after its co-founder Meow announced a controversial decision. Meow revealed on X that Jupiter would donate the SLERF limit order and DCA fees to the token’s presale participants. This decision was taken without consulting the community, a crucial part of the project. After the criticism, Meow explained that &#8220;no JUP tokens were involved in the donation and, despite the turbulence in the community, JUP’s price didn’t seem to be affected.&#8221; It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s price showed stabilization signs over the weekend, as highlighted by Sherpa.

					<description><![CDATA[Crypto expert popularly known as KSI has shared his thoughts on how the Bitcoin price could progress until the peak of this bull cycle. Based on his prediction, the flagship crypto could experience significant dips on its way to a new all-time high of $100,000.  $80,000 Could Be Next For Bitcoin KSI mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin could rise to between $73,000 and $80,000 from here. However, a correction could quickly follow, as the crypto analyst remarked that Bitcoin would drop to between $50,000 and $60,000 afterwards. KSI added that it would be a “boring red summer,” suggesting that BTC&#8217;s price won’t be encouraging during that period.  Related Reading: Ethereum Sees Notable Rise In Daily Activity, But Why Is Price Down? KSI claimed that things would then pick up again in the winter. He also stated that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the beginning of 2025 or even before the end of this year. With his prediction, KSI joins a list of analysts who have predicted that Bitcoin could hit the $100,000 mark before the year runs out.  Tom Dunleavy, Partner and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at MV Capital, previously stated that BTC would rise to that price level this year. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered initially predicted that Bitcoin would hit $100,000 by year-end before taking a more bullish stance and predicting that the flagship crypto would hit $150,000 by the end of 2024.  What To Expect From BTC&#8217;s Price KSI’s prediction also echoes the sentiments of crypto analyst Rekt Capital. In a recent analysis, Rekt Capital mentioned that Bitcoin would enter a “multi-month re-accumulation” after the Bitcoin Halving, which could last up to five months. The crypto analyst noted that this period is usually characterized by Bitcoin’s tepid price movement.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Go On Massive Buying Spree, Here’s How Much They’ve Bought Once that phase was over, Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin would break out from the re-accumulation area and make a parabolic move. This is said to be when BTC experiences “accelerated growth into a parabolic uptrend.” This phase lasts over a year, but Rekt Capital believes it may be cut in half in this market cycle with a “potential accelerated cycle occurring right now.” The accelerated cycle he refers to includes the fact that BTC hit a new all-time high (ATH) before the Bitcoin Halving. That has never happened in previous market cycles, raising the possibility of this bull market being largely different from past ones.  At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,400, up over 4% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.  BTC bulls struggle to hold price above $67,000 &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from Forkast News, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#8217;s what the latest trend in the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio suggests about where the market is currently in terms of a top. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Has Seen A Decline To The 2.34 Level According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the BTC MVRV ratio surged high earlier this year as the cryptocurrency rally took place. The &#8220;MVRV ratio&#8221; is a popular indicator that tracks the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap. The former is simply the total valuation of the asset&#8217;s supply at the current spot price, while the latter is an on-chain capitalization model. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders &#38; Price Top: Glassnode Reveals Pattern The realized cap measures the total sum of the value of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply, assuming that each coin in circulation has its true value at the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain rather than the current spot value. One way to interpret the realized cap is that since it takes into account the buying price of every token in circulation (assuming that the last transaction of every token was indeed the point at which it last changed hands), it essentially sums up the total capital the investors have invested in the asset. As such, the MVRV ratio tells us how the total value that Bitcoin investors are carrying right now (that is, the market cap) compares against the value they put in (the realized cap). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the past few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been turning down in recent days &#124; Source: IntoTheBlock on X As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio has had a value greater than 1 for a while now. When the indicator has such values, the market cap is greater than the realized cap, and hence, the investors carry net profits. With the latest rally in the asset, this indicator has surged to relatively high levels, a natural consequence of the holders&#8217; profits ballooning up with the price surge. After the recent drawdown in the price, though, the MVRV ratio has also turned itself around, as it&#8217;s now heading down. At present, the ratio has a value of around 2.34. &#8220;Traditionally, an MVRV ratio above 3 has been a reliable marker for predicting price peaks,&#8221; notes IntoTheBlock. So far, in the current rally, the metric hasn&#8217;t crossed this mark. It did come close recently, but the latest decline has meant it has gained a bit more distance to the level. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Halving May Not Result In Supply Squeeze: Glassnode Why have tops historically occurred at high values of the Bitcoin MVRV ratio? The answer is that investors in profits are more likely to participate in selling, and this temptation to take profits only increases as their gains grow larger. Because of this, selloffs are most probable when the market is holding extreme levels of profits, which is exactly what high MVRV ratio values reflect. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,200, up 3% over the past 24 hours. The price of the asset appears to have rebounded over the last few days &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Yiğit Ali Atasoy on Unsplash.com, IntoTheBlock.com, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>&#8220;Traditionally, an MVRV ratio above 3 has been a reliable marker for predicting price peaks,&#8221; notes IntoTheBlock. So far, in the current rally, the metric hasn&#8217;t crossed this mark. It did come close recently, but the latest decline has meant it has gained a bit more distance to the level.</p>

<p>Why have tops historically occurred at high values of the Bitcoin MVRV ratio? The answer is that investors in profits are more likely to participate in selling, and this temptation to take profits only increases as their gains grow larger.</p>
<p>Because of this, selloffs are most probable when the market is holding extreme levels of profits, which is exactly what high MVRV ratio values reflect.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,200, up 3% over the past 24 hours.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s most valuable coin, is once again deviating from historical norms. According to an analysis by one crypto analyst, the coin is in the &#8220;overbought&#8221; territory of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the first time in the lead-up to halving. The RSI is a popular technical indicator analysts use to gauge the price momentum of traded instruments.  Bitcoin Overheating? RSI Stands Above 70 The analyst points out that the Bitcoin RSI on the monthly chart is currently above 70, indicating an overbought condition and overheating. This is a significant development as it&#8217;s the first time in Bitcoin&#8217;s history that this has happened before a halving.  The Bitcoin network is set to halve miner rewards in mid-April. This event, which occurs roughly every 200,000 blocks, will cut rewards distributed to miners by 50% from the current level of 6.125 BTC. Miners play a vital role in confirming transactions and maintaining network security.  Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Real Pump’ Nears New All-Time Highs, Analyst Says The fact that Bitcoin prices appear to be &#8220;overheating&#8221; just before halving is net bullish for the coin. It suggests that prices are not only breaking from historical trends but also building strong momentum. Besides the strong upside momentum, the analyst notes that Bitcoin now trades above a critical dynamic level on the monthly chart. The confluence of these positive developments could explain why traders are upbeat. Most analysts agree that the coin will likely break higher in the weeks ahead, clearing the recent all-time high of around $73,800. BTC Pinned Below $73,000 And Consolidating  Thus far, Bitcoin prices are firm, increasing as evident in the daily chart. After sharp contractions in the past few trading sessions, the welcomed reversal over the weekend lifted the coin towards the elusive $70,000 level and a previous all-time high. However, judging from the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, a break above $73,800 would likely catalyze more demand. So far, prices are moving sideways within a broad range despite signals of strength relayed from other indicators. Related Reading: Why Is The Price Of LUNC And USTC Up Today? While some investors are bullish, expecting prices to rise, caution should prevail. A close above $74,000 would thrust Bitcoin into unchartered territory. Beyond this, the analyst uses technical indicators to make projections. These tools use historical parameters and lag. As such, they may not be as accurate and, thus, misleading in some instances.

					<description><![CDATA[There are a couple of events to watch out for this week, as they could prove pivotal in determining the future trajectory of the crypto market. These events could provide some certainty to the market or cause investors to wait on the sidelines for more favorable market conditions.  Events That Could Affect The Market This Week Some Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to speak at different events this week. One of them is Governor Lisa Cook, who will give a lecture on March 25. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also participate in a discussion at the Monetary Policy Conference on March 29.  Related Reading: Bitcoin ETFs Bleed For One Week Straight – Can Price Recover To $73,000? Their speeches are significant as they could provide valuable insights into the current state of the economy and what to expect from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates in its fight against inflation. Macroeconomic factors like interest rates usually impact the crypto market and partly determine the sentiments among crypto traders. The crypto market is usually bullish whenever the Federal Reserve adopts a dovish stance on whether or not to hike interest rates. Therefore, these officials sounding positive in their speeches could help boost investors’ confidence in the crypto market since they would be less worried about things on the macro side.  Meanwhile, several economic data will be released this week, including the Consumer Confidence and Consumer Sentiment data and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. These releases offer insights into the economy’s strength and guide the Fed in deciding on future interest rate decisions.  Crypto Needs A Big Win This Week Stakeholders and investors in the industry will no doubt hope that the events lined up for this week will provide a momentum boost for the crypto market. Last week was one to forget as things cooled after weeks of seeing the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, and altcoins make significant runs. This downward trend is believed to have been due to some external factors. Related Reading: Bernstein Analysts Says Bitcoin Will Reach A New ATH By Year End, Here’s The Target One of them is the net outflows that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded throughout last week, with many investors taking profits from the various funds. These Bitcoin ETFs had previously seen an impressive amount of inflows into them, which positively affected Bitcoin’s price. As such, a trend of outflows was also expected to influence Bitcoin’s price, although negatively.  These Spot Bitcoin ETFs will again be in the spotlight this week, with the crypto community waiting to see if the sentiments among the ETF investors will change. A sustained trend of profit-taking this week could spark another decline in the crypto market.  Total market cap chart at $2.47 trillion &#124; Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on Tradingview.com Featured image from CNBC, chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>
