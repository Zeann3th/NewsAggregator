<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solana&#8217;s Value Escalation in the Wake of Bitcoin&#8217;s Halving Event</strong></h2>



<p>The anticipation around Bitcoin&#8217;s forthcoming halving has turned the spotlight towards <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/08/15/solana-sol-price-prediction-sol-accumulates-targets-30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana (SOL)</a>, which has already shown potential for significant growth. Despite a downturn in the broader market, SOL&#8217;s value surged by 33.86%, nearing its all-time high.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This surge highlights Solana&#8217;s strength and the market&#8217;s confidence in its future prospects. With the Bitcoin halving expected to diminish the creation of new coins and possibly elevate Bitcoin&#8217;s price to an astounding $200,000, Solana is on the cusp of an exceptional growth phase.</p>

<p>Predictions from experts, including those generated by AI like ChatGPT, foresee Solana&#8217;s price potentially soaring to $450. This anticipated growth, fueled by a market-wide rally and Solana&#8217;s technological advancements, would break new ground for the cryptocurrency, reinforcing its foundational role within the digital currency ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Navigating the Crypto Seas: Forecasting ICP&#8217;s Future</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>Before the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF, there was hype about its use cases, which lured millions of fresh users and billions of dollars in inflow. Over the last few weeks, Grayscale&#8217;s ETF has been witnessing massive outflow.</strong></em></p>



<p>The Bitcoin spot ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) has seen an inflow of $15.4 Million after a massive outflow in the past few weeks. The ETFs of Fidelity and BlackRock are riding high.</p>



<p>In the past 24 hours, IBIT&#8217;s spot ETF by BlackRock saw an intraday volume of $2.62 Billion, Grayscale (GBTC) $1.34 Billion, and FBTC (Fidelity) $1.26 Billion. Grayscale (GBTC) has $27.68 Billion of assets under management, and IBT has $15.58 Billion AUM.</p>



<p>The total intraday volume of the Bitcoin ETF market is $6.44 Billion, and the market capitalization is $76.46 Billion. Earlier this week, the ETF category saw a cumulative outflow of $887.6 Million, majorly from the Grayscale.</p>



<p>Around 11 institutions entered the race for the ETF in January 2024, and the approval of Bitcoin spot ETF will be written in the history of the crypto market. A week after approval, it saw an inflow of billions of dollars and some new users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hype of Ethereum spot ETF is broadly circulated, and there is speculation that it might get a green signal from regulators in May 2024. According to market observers, the inflow of funds is directed by the flourishing price of Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BTC Pre Spot ETF Approval Vs Post Approval</strong></h2>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States has rejected the application for the approval of the<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/01/30/hong-kongs-sec-receives-its-1st-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bitcoin spot ETF</a>. Companies like Grayscale and Fidelity have tried to get regulatory approval but failed every time. </p>



<p>Regarding price movement, Bitcoin has changed its track and path of trading, and suddenly, the approval of spot ETF has pushed the price above $60k. When writing, it was trading at $70,760 with an intraday growth of 5.65%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Market observers broadly thanked the ETFs as, after their approval, the prices of BTC first traded above $73,000, which became its all-time high. In the 52 weeks, its prices grew 155.31%; in terms of market cap, BTC is the largest, and in trading volume, it is the second most traded crypto.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Market Price Updates</strong></h3>



<p>The crypto market capitalization has surged more than 5% in the past 24 hours and reached $2.62 Trillion as of writing. Ethereum is the second most prominent cryptocurrency in market capitalization; it surged 5.69% in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ondo&#8217;s (ONDO) price surged 119% in the past seven days, making it the weekly gainer&#8217;s list topper. Internet Computers (ICP) grew 72.52%, eCash 49.70%, Floki (FLOKI) 45.46% and Dogecoin (DOGE) 42.58%.</p>

<p><em><strong>Till now, there is no clarity on whether all cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities. The conclusion of the SEC Vs Ripple case could offer a lot of regulatory clarity for the sector.</strong></em></p>



<p>Most recently, the Securities Commission of the United States reminded the judge of a federal court to grant a final verdict over the lawsuit from Ripple (XRP). The lawsuit was filed following the claims of the SEC about the violation of securities laws by Ripple Labs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first legal tussle; dozens of crypto-based companies have faced legal proceedings from the SEC. The remainder for judgment includes permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgement interest, and civil penalties of approximately $2 Billion.</p>



<p>Market analysts and Ripple executives broadly criticize the commission&#8217;s move. Following the redaction, the SEC filed its public version of the remedies brief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The majority of allegations are based on the violation of the Securities Act of 1933 and also on the unregistered offerings. Several analysts claim that the brief is solely favoring the regulatory commission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its letter, the SEC notes that it wants Ripple to pay $876,308,712 over the charges of disgorgement, although it also wants the firm to pay $198,150,940 for prejudgement and in civil penalties, it is supposed to pay $876,308,712.</p>



<p>There are speculations that if the judgment over the lawsuit favors the SEC, the market might fall suddenly. Among all cryptocurrencies, the market capitalization of the XRP is the sixth biggest.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Cash app is not exactly a bank but it functions like a bank. Cash App uses third-party banking partners which helps it earn revenue from 3 basic segments.</strong></em></p>



<p>People are always curious about whether Cash App is a bank. In this article, it is explained on how this widely-used mobile payment app operates, and how it can offer services that are similar to those provided by traditional banks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Cash App?</strong></h2>



<p>Cash App functions as a bank even though it is not a bank itself. It offers users a bank account with routing and account numbers as a savings account. Users can receive ACH transfers through the Cash App and their funds are FDIC-insured if they have a Cash Card. Block, Inc. Owns Cash App as its subsidiary.</p>



<p>The banking services, on Cash App are provided by third-party partners who offer users bank account routing and account numbers FDIC insurance coverage and additional services related to banking.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cash Apps Banking Partners</strong></h3>



<p>Different banking partners are used by Cash App for different services. For instance, Sutton Bank manages the Cash Card and most other banking services, while Wells Fargo provides passthrough FDIC insurance and also helps with the Cash Card. Meanwhile, direct deposits and Plaid transfers are handled by Lincoln Savings Bank.</p>



<p>Fees are charged to businesses and users for various services, such as instant money withdrawals, which are subject to a cost of 0.5% to 1.75% of the value transferred out, whereas sending from a credit card incurs a 3% fee. Moreover, subscription services include Cash App&#8217;s financial services-related products, including Cash App Card, Cash App Instant Deposit volumes, and related processing costs and fees.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin and Cash App</strong></h2>



<p>The largest revenue generator for Cash App&#8217;s business is Bitcoin. Cash App applies a service fee whenever a customer sells Bitcoin, and the price difference between what Bitcoin exchanges and individuals pay can range from 1% to 4%. Cash App takes these differences into consideration when presenting prices to its users, which in turn generates supplementary revenue on the exchanges it facilitates.</p>



<p>Square, Inc. changed its name to Block, Inc. in December 2021, while retaining the same stock ticker symbol &#8220;SQ.&#8221; The Square brand name will continue to be associated with the company&#8217;s Seller business. This offers an integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services for sellers. The Block brand is focused on the consumer side and aims to empower individuals, artists, fans, developers, and sellers economically.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Financial Outlook of Cash App</strong></h2>



<p>Cash App discloses its earnings by segmenting its revenue into three categories; Cash App, Square and Corporate and Other. Specifically Cash App breaks down its revenue into transactions, subscriptions and services, as Bitcoin revenue.</p>



<p>In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which ended on September 30, 2023, Cash App reported revenues of $3.58 Billion, indicating a year-over-year growth of 33.5%. Additionally, the gross profit of Cash App was $983.86 Million, which represented a YoY increase of 27%.</p>



<p>All segments experienced growth in revenue, with transaction-based revenue expanding as a result of a rise in Cash App Business gross payment volume. This was primarily driven by peer-to-peer transactions received by business accounts and peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cash App: Revenue Segments&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Cash App divides its revenue into three segments &#8211; transaction-based revenue, subscription-services revenue, and Bitcoin revenue. Block reports this data but does not provide a breakdown of income by business segment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2023/12/31/turing-completeness-ensures-anonymity-in-crypto-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transactions</a> segment includes the fees charged for peer-to-peer transactions made by businesses and individuals. This segment generated $120.78 Million in Q3 2023, indicating a growth of 1.96% from $118.46 Million YoY. The revenue generated by this segment accounted for 3.37% of Cash App&#8217;s total revenue. </p>



<p>Cash App&#8217;s Subscription Services segment covers financial-service products such as Cash App&#8217;s card, Instant Deposit volumes, and interest earned on customer funds. In Q3 2023, this particular category generated $1.04 Billion, marking a 29.48% rise from the $803.67 Million YoY. This category constitutes 29.03% of Cash App&#8217;s overall revenue.</p>



<p>Cash App&#8217;s Bitcoin segment generates revenue by selling Bitcoin to its customers. In Q3 2023, this segment earned $2.42 Billion, a 37.49% increase from $1.76 Billion YoY, accounting for 67.60% of Cash App&#8217;s revenue.</p>



<p>In June 2023, Cash App identified a technical issue where customers were being double charged for certain Cash Card transactions. The company rectified the issue and announced refunds to be made to affected customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Extra Features of Cash App</strong></h2>



<p>Besides using Cash App for payments individuals can also utilize it for saving money through Cash App Savings. They have the option to set savings goals round up their transactions to the dollar, on Cash App and allocate the extra amount towards their savings target.</p>



<p>While Cash App offers a range of services like transferring funds making offline purchases and investing it is evident that there are limitations to its functionality. It might serve better as a tool to a bank account rather, than a complete substitute.</p>



<p>The lack of a physical branch network can present challenges for larger transactions. These include purchasing a new car, and writing paper checks for the Cash App account balance which is not usually possible for a company like Cash App.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The global banking industry is growing and technology is playing a huge role in the making. While more and more people are being shifted towards a cashless and virtual banking system, companies like Cash App are left with a lot of space to grow.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>



<p>Cash App is not a bank, but it provides users with a bank account and routing number. It uses different banking partners for various services, such as Sutton Bank for the Cash Card and Lincoln Savings Bank for direct deposits and Plaid transfers. Fees are charged for services such as instant money withdrawals and sending money with a credit card. The lack of a physical branch network can make larger transactions and paper checks difficult.</p>

<p>In the rapidly evolving realm of cryptocurrency, a seismic shift is underway, and it revolves around Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. Picture a world where tangible assets such as real estate and fine art seamlessly merge with the digital realm of blockchain. <a href="https://www.mantrachain.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MANTRA</a> Chain, a trailblazer in RWA-focused Layer 1<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/02/17/the-coinbases-report-on-blockchain-technology-advantages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> blockchain technology</a>, stands at the forefront of this transformative wave. As the buzz around RWA tokenization reaches a crescendo, MANTRA $OM emerges as the torchbearer, harnessing innovation and regulatory compliance to redefine the very fabric of asset ownership and investment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Technical Signals Flashing Green: Volume Fuels Recovery</strong></h2>



<p>The $OM charts paint a picture of a robust asset poised for a surge. Following a brief consolidation period, we&#8217;re witnessing a robust recovery fueled by a significant uptick in trading volume. This surge in activity indicates intense buying pressure behind $OM, a strong indicator of a potential price explosion.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rock-Solid Foundation: Trendline Support and Clear Targets</strong></h3>



<p>$OM currently rests comfortably on a well-established trendline support level, a historical price point that has consistently acted as a springboard for bullish rebounds. This strategic entry point suggests further upward momentum for investors. Reaching the All-Time High (ATH) is an achievable initial target, with even more significant price appreciation anticipated beyond the ATH. Our analysis identifies potential price targets of TP1: $1.35106 and TP2: $2.00.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oversold RSI Signals Bullish Reversal</strong></h3>



<p>Adding another layer of<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/25/noones-ceo-ray-youssef-is-bullish-on-the-nigerian-crypto-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> bullish </a>confirmation, the Stochastic RSI indicator has dipped below 10, signaling an oversold condition. It often precedes a powerful reversal, with a surge in buying pressure propelling the price upwards. The recent bullish crossover on the STOCH RSI further reinforces this optimistic outlook.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MANTRA&#8217;s Strong Fundamentals: Powering the $OM Takeoff</strong></h3>



<p>The bullish case for $OM extends beyond technicals, underpinned by MANTRA’s robust foundation:</p>



<p><strong>&#8211;</strong> <strong>RWA Tokenization Leadership</strong>: Spearheading RWA tokenization in Asia and the MENA region, MANTRA has secured $11 million in funding led by Shorooq Partners.</p>



<p><strong>&#8211; Veteran Team:</strong> Led by a seasoned team with exceptional expertise in both blockchain and finance.</p>



<p><strong>&#8211; Global Accessibility:</strong> $OM is available on leading exchanges like Binance, OKX, and KuCoin, ensuring easy access for a worldwide audience.</p>



<p><strong>&#8211; Hongbai Testnet on the Horizon:</strong> The upcoming launch of the <a href="https://www.mantrachain.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MANTRA</a> Chain Hongbai Testnet signifies a significant milestone, attracting more users and solidifying MANTRA&#8217;s position in the RWA landscape.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion: $OM – Unstoppable in the RWA Revolution</strong></h4>



<p>With bullish technical indicators, a surge in recovery volume, and robust fundamentals, $OM is set for a meteoric rise. As the RWA tokenization market continues its parabolic journey, $OM presents a golden opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on this revolutionary movement. It isn&#8217;t just bullish – it&#8217;s a bullish tsunami ready to sweep the market by storm.</p>
