<p><em><strong>A United States district judge in New York has permitted the Securities and Exchange Commission to continue with its legal action against Coinbase Inc.</strong></em></p>



<p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that the US Securities and Exchange Commission can proceed with its lawsuit against Coinbase Inc., the largest US cryptocurrency trading platform. The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase failed to register as a securities business.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC Vs Coinbase: The story began in January</strong></h2>



<p>In January, Coinbase and the SEC had oral arguments over the exchange&#8217;s dismissal motion, which claimed that the SEC has no authority over crypto exchanges unless Congress says so. Moreover, in the middle of March this year, a legal challenge asserted that the regulator had failed to regulate crypto correctly.&nbsp; However, it is not directly linked to Coinbase&#8217;s ongoing court battle with the SEC.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Accusation By SEC&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The Securities and <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2022/03/23/heres-why-thailand-securities-and-exchange-commission-banned-crypto-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exchange Commission</a> accused Coinbase of running an unregistered exchange that lists unregistered crypto securities illegally. Additionally, to protect retailers, the SEC likes to have everything bought and sold over an exchange under its regulation. However, it is also true that the number of scams in the crypto market may be bothering the government.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC’s Partial Victory in the Battle</strong></h2>



<p>US District Judge Katherine Polk Failla said in her opinion Wednesday that the SEC adequately alleged that Coinbase engages in the “unregistered sale and offer of securities” and illegally operates as an exchange, a broker, and a clearing agency under federal securities laws.</p>



<p>Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and others argue in motions to dismiss SEC lawsuits against them that the SEC did not have the authority to change course, as it required approval from Congress. Moreover, the coin base posted that if the SEC insists on moving forward without congressional authorization, that decision must be made and implemented through prospective rulemaking.</p>



<p>Coinbase&#8217;s appeal against the SEC&#8217;s rulemaking denial is a separate court dispute from the SEC&#8217;s June 2023 lawsuit against Coinbase, which alleged that it operated as an unlicensed exchange and offered unregistered securities. However, the court agreed to toss the claim that the exchange acted as an unregistered broker via its Wallet application.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US District Court Judge Katherine Polk&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>US District Court Judge Katherine Polk Failla previously questioned the agency&#8217;s interpretation of the law during a hearing. However, Failla denied the defendant&#8217;s motion, citing the SEC&#8217;s sufficient pleading that Coinbase operates as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency under federal securities laws.</p>



<p>Bloomberg analyst Elliot Stein had estimated a 70% probability of Coinbase prevailing in the regulator&#8217;s lawsuit, but the court&#8217;s decision came as a surprise.</p>



<p>Following the court&#8217;s decision, both parties are now gearing up for a discovery phase. Paul Grewal, chief legal officer at Coinbase, clarified that his company was prepared for the setback.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, the Court decided that our SEC case will move forward on most of the claims, but dismissed the claims against Coinbase Wallet. We were prepared for this, and we look forward to uncovering more about the SEC’s internal views and discussions on crypto regulation. 1/6</p>&mdash; paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1772993916146479193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>He wrote on X that they look forward to uncovering more about the SEC’s internal views and discussions on crypto regulation. At press time, Coinbase shares are down more than 3.79%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>Under federal securities laws, Coinbase has been accused of illegally operating as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The court rejected the claim that the exchange acted as an unregistered broker via its Wallet application. Therefore, it resulted in the partial winning of SEC and further resulted in the decline of Coinbbase stock by over 3%.</p>

<p><strong>The use of virtual currencies has increased significantly in human and drug trafficking. Out of all the virtual currencies, Bitcoin has become the most popular way to execute illegal transactions that support the business of smuggling and exploitation of people. The U.S. Department of Treasury has released an analysis recently.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Do Criminals Prefer Bitcoin?</strong></h2>



<p>The anonymity feature of virtual currency or <a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2024/03/10/an-ultimate-guide-on-doge-killer-leash-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cryptocurrency</a> attracts criminals. They use this currency to avoid detection when paying for illegal activities such as human and drug trafficking.</p>



<p>It has increased the challenges faced by federal law to enforce laws against child and human trafficking. It has become difficult to track transactions that use crypto as a medium of exchange and peer-to-peer mobile payments.</p>



<p>The U.S. Government Accountability Office has found that in 2021, out of the 27 commercial trafficking marketplaces that were examined, 15 accepted virtual currencies. Virtual currency ATMs are standalone machines that allow buying and selling. The exchange of virtual currencies can be used for illegal activities such as laundering and drug trafficking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Steps Taken By Federal Government To Address Crime Facilitated By Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Multiple federal agencies were tasked with investigating and prosecuting trafficking cases that involved online marketplaces and virtual currency. It included federal law enforcement entities inside the Department of Justice and other agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, that support investigations of trafficking cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recent actions and investigations:</p>



<ul>
<li>In 2016, the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration and customs enforcement’s homeland security investigations and the Secret Service identified and forfeited over $1.2 Million from the virtual currency wallet of a trafficker.</li>



<li>In 2020, the Treasury’s Internal Revenue Service Cyber Crime Unit’s investigation helped shut down Helix. It was a dark web platform that laundered money for drug traffickers.</li>



<li>The Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued guidelines to help financial institutions detect trafficking activities that involved virtual currencies.</li>



<li>Federal banking, securities, and derivatives regulators oversee the compliance of financial institutions with banks&#8217; AML requirements, including their reporting of suspicious activities.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Crypto transactions are permanently recorded on public blockchains which helps law enforcement agencies use blockchain analysis tools to investigate illegal activities.</p>



<p>However, criminals make use of privacy technology to hide the movements of funds across the blockchain and it thus becomes harder to track such illicit transactions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FinCEN Released Report: Highlights</strong></h3>



<p>The period of 2020 and 2021 saw an upswing in the use of crypto, especially bitcoin, according to the financial firms’ government filings. In this period, the research found more than 2,311 reported uses of cryptocurrencies in trafficking activities. The transactions amounted to more than $412 Million.</p>



<p>The victims of these trafficking activities were forced to work as laborers, slaves, involuntary servitudes, peonage and other kinds of sex acts. In 2021, the reported uses were 1,975.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andrea Gacki, Director at FinCEN, said that the reports from financial institutions are bringing out human traffickers, thus saving and protecting innocent lives. It also helps in law enforcement.</p>

<p><em><strong>FTX customers demand higher payout for undervalued &#8220;Sam Coins&#8221;. However, the company claims they&#8217;re worth zero.</strong></em></p>



<p>FTX&#8217;s customers are requesting higher payouts from the bankrupt company, claiming that the digital tokens, known as &#8220;Sam Coins,&#8221; are undervalued. However, they completely disregard their association with convicted co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Investors Are Demanding High Payout&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>These investors holding tokens called Serum, MAPS, and OXY are urging US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey. These investors want to override the company&#8217;s experts&#8217; conclusion that the tokens are &#8220;nearly worthless,&#8221; as mentioned in a Bloomberg report.</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, who created Serum and obtained control over the other two tokens, was involved in securing deals related to them, as stated in court documents.</p>



<p>When FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, it held a significant majority of the tokens, far exceeding what could be sold. Additionally even without considering the fraudulent activities that led to its collapse, as the company argued in a court filing.</p>



<p>Token holders are challenging a company&#8217;s estimation of the value of tokens. The company&#8217;s advisers proposed a minimal amount. However, the holders claim their valuation method values the tokens at hundreds of millions of dollars. They have filed claims for payment based on their calculations.</p>



<p>FTX&#8217;s lawyers have indicated that other former customers who invested in the trading platform will likely receive full reimbursement for their investments before bankruptcy. These customers invested in US dollars, Bitcoin (BTC), and other assets that still hold value today.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FTX Claims That Sam Coins Are Worth ‘Zero’</strong></h2>



<p>FTX wants to quash certain investors&#8217; claims for &#8220;Sam Coins,&#8221; arguing that they should be valued at zero in an ongoing bankruptcy case. During a court hearing on March 26, lawyers representing FTX requested Delaware bankruptcy judge John Dorsey. Moreover, they requested to heavily reduce customer claims for a few digital tokens that are closely connected to the imprisoned<a href="https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2022/06/06/giving-pledge-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-will-empty-his-deep-pockets-for-a-good-cause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> FTX founder</a>, Sam &#8220;SBF&#8221; Bankman-Fried. </p>



<p>FTX lawyer Brian Glueckstein mentioned that customer claims for the native tokens should be heavily discounted or reduced to zero. On the other hand, the investors valued the tokens they held at hundreds of millions of dollars and presented related calculations in court.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Does FTX Valuation Expert Says?</strong></h3>



<p>FTX&#8217;s valuation expert, Sabrina Howell, concluded that because the firm held more than 95% of the OXY and MAP tokens it would take decades to liquidate them. Moreover, creditor attorney Kurt Gwynne argued that the company hired experts to unfairly quote low estimates.</p>



<p>Based on their analysis, FTX asserted claims associated with MAPS and OXY tokens should be deemed worthless, worth over $600 million at current rates. Meanwhile, claims associated with SERUM tokens &#8211; worth $509 million &#8211; should be discounted by about 58%.</p>



<p>However, the FTX customers asked for the FTX lawyer&#8217;s estimates to be overruled, claiming that the four digital assets in question. Moreover, the Sam coins, are still worth more than $1.1 billion in total. Judge Dorsey found determining cryptocurrency&#8217;s exact value challenging due to its lack of intrinsic worth. He deferred the ruling on the disputed crypto assets&#8217; value estimation after hearing arguments from both parties.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>



<p>FTX customers with Serum, MAPS, and OXY tokens are requesting higher payouts from the bankrupt company, claiming the tokens are undervalued. The company&#8217;s experts say the tokens are nearly worthless, but investors want US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey to override this.&nbsp;</p>
