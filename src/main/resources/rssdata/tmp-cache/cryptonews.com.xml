<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Countries such as Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands adhere to the legislative framework established by the European Union for regulating crypto assets.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Spot Trading Dominates Trading in Western Europe</span></h2>

<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Centralized exchanges and spot trading dominate the cryptocurrency trading landscape in Western Europe. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Users in Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands exhibit a preference for trading futures, while other countries lean towards spot trading.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Centralized exchanges attract the majority of daily traders, with centralized exchange (CEX) traffic surpassing decentralized exchange (DEX) traffic by a factor of 10. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Among those opting for decentralized platforms, PancakeSwap and Uniswap emerge as the most popular exchanges. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Over the past year, centralized exchange traffic from Western European users has experienced significant growth, particularly in Germany, Switzerland, and Poland.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Germany and Switzerland saw a year-over-year increase of over 50%, while Poland witnessed a growth rate of 145%. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, France and Belgium exhibited slower growth rates, with Belgium even experiencing a 6.8% decline compared to the same period last year.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DeFi Accounts for Majority of Crypto Activity in Western Europe</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Decentralized finance (DeFi) usage constitutes the majority of cryptocurrency activity in Western Europe, while peer-to-peer (P2P) trading volumes remain relatively low. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The prevalence of purchasing digital assets using fiat deposits or linked cards contributes to the limited adoption of crypto P2P trading in the region. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In contrast, regions like Southeast Asia rely more on P2P transfers as the primary instrument for cryptocurrency trading.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Regarding asset choices and trending topics, Western European traders actively participate in decentralized projects, show familiarity with DEX tools and trading, engage with NFTs and Web3 platforms, and demonstrate interest in popular chain ecosystems like Solana. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Emerging cryptocurrencies such as Ordinals, NFTs, RWAs, DePin, Solana ecosystem tokens, and meme coins have gained significant attention among traders in Western Europe throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;The Bitget research suggests that cryptocurrency participants in the region typically possess a high level of education, exercise caution, and prioritize long-term investments,&#8221; the report wrote. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/floki-inu/">Floki price</a> has declined by 2% in the past 24 hours, slipping to $0.0002274 as the crypto market as a whole gains by just over 1% today.</p>
<p>FLOKI has now fallen by 9% in a week and by 25% in the past fortnight, yet the meme token remains up by a very impressive 420% in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>This caps a year in which the coin has also gained by nearly 600% and passed a $2 billion market cap, and with the market returning to growth in the past couple of days, it could continue rising into the weekend.</p>
<h2>Floki Price Prediction as FLOKI Reaches $2 Billion Market Cap – Time to Buy?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Despite Floki&#8217;s decline today, its chart gives the impression that it could rebound soon.</p>
<p>Most notably, its relative strength index (purple) has spent the past couple of days below 50, if not lower.</p>
<p>This means that traders have been overselling it recently, and that it should rise sooner or later.</p>
<figure id="attachment_190858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190858" style="width: 1355px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-190858" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28100540/1711620339-floki-price-chart.png" alt="Floki price chart." width="1355" height="758" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28100540/1711620339-floki-price-chart.png 1355w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28100540/1711620339-floki-price-chart-300x168.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28100540/1711620339-floki-price-chart-1024x573.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28100540/1711620339-floki-price-chart-768x430.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28100540/1711620339-floki-price-chart-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1355px) 100vw, 1355px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-190858" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s also significant that FLOKI&#8217;s 30-day average (orange) fell below its 200-day (blue) earlier this morning, a sign that the token could bottom soon and resume rising.</p>
<p>One thing that is concerning, however, is that FLOKI&#8217;s trading volume is still quite low, at $340 million today.</p>
<p>This represents an 85% drop in relation to volumes witnessed in early March, when the coin reached $0.000260 and upwards.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s therefore safe to say that demand remains a little low, with whales and larger traders neglecting FLOKI at the moment.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The price of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FLOKI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$FLOKI</a> increased by ~75% today!</p>
<p>We noticed that whales started unstaking <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FLOKI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$FLOKI</a> and selling for profits!</p>
<p>6 wallets have unstaked 30B <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FLOKI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$FLOKI</a>($7.14M) in the past 6 hours and are selling <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24FLOKI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$FLOKI</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In fact, the most recent data on whale FLOKI transfers involved a number of wallets unstaking their tokens and selling.</p>
<p>This was earlier in the month, around the time of FLOKI&#8217;s rise towards $0.00030, and since then nothing much has changed.</p>
<p>Having said that, the wider crypto market looks to be regaining momentum, something which will likely help the Floki price recover and rally again.</p>
<p>Not only is the market recovering impetus, but a number of coming developments may help it reach new heights for the year.</p>
<p>This includes <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fomc-interest-rate-decision-signals-all-clear-for-bitcoin-bull-run.htm">incoming Federal Reserve rate cuts</a>, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/will-the-sec-approve-ethereum-etfs-this-year.htm">the potential approval of Ethereum ETFs</a>, and next month&#8217;s Bitcoin halving.</p>
<p>At the same time, Floki Inu will be quietly improving its fundamentals and value as a meme token, with <a href="https://floki.medium.com/floki-roadmap-whats-next-on-our-agenda-3e957b56d277">the coin&#8217;s roadmap outlining a number of significant events this year</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">FLOKI ROADMAP: WHAT’S NEXT ON OUR AGENDA…</p>
<p>From the get-go, we’ve been VERY clear about our goal for Floki:</p>
<p>To be the most known and most used cryptocurrency in the world.</p>
<p>Our new roadmap outlines how we intend to achieve this:<a href="https://t.co/cBqJXwhziH">https://t.co/cBqJXwhziH</a> <a href="https://t.co/hBydq4D4lX">pic.twitter.com/hBydq4D4lX</a></p>
<p>&mdash; FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealFlokiInu/status/1771166636420034588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>For this reason, the Floki price could reach $0.00030 again in the next few weeks, before breaking its ATH in the summer.</p>
<h2>Newer Meme Tokens for Bigger Rallies</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
If traders are worried that FLOKI may have already seen its biggest rallies, then they could do well to look at newer alternatives, particularly coins with a good chance of listing on new exchanges.</p>
<p>One new meme token that does have a good chance of gaining new listings is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/ext/sponge">Sponge (SPONGE)</a>, an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that launched the second version of its coin nearly two months ago.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/polygon/pair-explorer/0xa01f64fa1b923dd9c5c7618b39a6ba8098a88863?t=1707820151436">has risen by over 390%</a> since listing on Uniswap in early February, with the token likely to list on new trading platforms in the coming weeks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_190928" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190928" style="width: 1392px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-190928" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28110133/1711623693-sponge-price-chart.png" alt="Sponge price chart." width="1392" height="784" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28110133/1711623693-sponge-price-chart.png 1392w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28110133/1711623693-sponge-price-chart-300x169.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28110133/1711623693-sponge-price-chart-1024x577.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28110133/1711623693-sponge-price-chart-768x433.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28110133/1711623693-sponge-price-chart-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1392px) 100vw, 1392px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-190928" class="wp-caption-text">Source: DEXTools/TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Compared to most other new meme tokens this year, SPONGE has been able to hold onto its initial gains, as well as build upon them.</p>
<p>This is partly because its first version launched (successfully) last year and has already accumulated a strong following, with Sponge&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/spongeoneth">official Twitter account having some 36,000 followers</a>.</p>
<p>Yet SPONGE V2 has also brought in a couple of important improvements, including a new staking model that<span> offers a minimum yield of 40% APY.</span></p>
<p>In recent weeks, this yield has even risen to <a href="https://twitter.com/spongeoneth/status/1752987205931577685">triple figures</a>, with the rate depending on the number of stakes.</p>
<p><span>What&#8217;s also exciting about SPONGE V2 is that it&#8217;s close to launching its very own P2E racing game, for which it will be the native token.</span></p>

<p><span>This game will enable</span> players to compete against each other to rank the highest on a global leaderboard, with the highest-ranking players earning the highest rewards.</p>
<p>The launch of this game is likely to increase demand for SPONGE, and in combination with upcoming listings, its price could rally significantly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting in January 2025, crypto firms seeking to operate in Indonesia must undergo evaluation in a regulatory sandbox before being licensed. This regulatory change will come into effect as supervision of the crypto industry transitions to the Financial Services Authority (OJK).</p>
<p>Firms offering crypto services in Indonesia without undergoing evaluation in the sandbox will be deemed to be operating illegally.</p>
<h2>Hasan Fawzi, Chief Executive, Stresses the Importance of a Regulatory Sandbox for Crypto Assets Under OJK Supervision</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
A regulatory sandbox is a crucial testing ground for evaluating financial products and services&#8217; safety, reliability, and innovative potential. It provides an isolated environment where trial runs can be conducted to enhance security measures and promote responsible management within the financial sector.</p>
<p>Indonesia&#8217;s crypto industry currently falls under the supervision of the commodities and futures trading regulator, Bappebti, as crypto assets are categorized as commodities. However, with the upcoming transition of oversight to the Financial Services Authority (OJK), crypto assets are expected to be reclassified as financial instruments.</p>
<p>Hasan Fawzi, Chief Executive of the Supervision of Financial Sector Technology Innovation, Digital Financial Assets, and Crypto Assets, <a href="https://finance.detik.com/fintech/d-7263093/berantas-investasi-bodong-aset-kripto-baru-wajib-masuk-regulatory-sandbox-ojk">highlighted</a> that once the OJK regulates crypto assets, they will also need to undergo evaluation in a regulatory sandbox. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think this is our spirit at OJK, especially in consumer protection and education. We really hope that all of our regulatory mechanisms will be present and have a direct impact on preventing fraudulent investments.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Fawzi emphasized the importance of regulatory mechanisms in preventing fraudulent activities and stated that crypto companies with new products or business models must participate in the sandbox. Failure to do so may result in classification as an unlicensed or illegal product.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s easy to organize ITSK that are not registered as participants in our sandbox, or later after there are clusters that we determine with permission from the OK or without permission, then like the others, we will encourage the consumer community to choose whether they are good or not.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Indonesia Collaborates with Global Partners to Develop Comprehensive Crypto Regulation Strategy</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/giant-indonesian-market-gets-first-regulated-local-crypto-ex-5164.htm">Indonesia has been actively pursuing guidelines</a> to regulate the crypto industry, leading to collaborations with other nations and international partnerships to develop a comprehensive crypto strategy. Indonesia&#8217;s Financial Services Authority (OJK) has been at the forefront of these efforts, working with financial regulators from Malaysia, Singapore, and Dubai to establish a strong foundation for crypto policy.</p>
<p>As part of these collaborations, the OJK has been involved in writing Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with critical entities such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority of Dubai, and Bank Negara of Malaysia. These partnerships reflect a collective effort to create a regulatory framework addressing cryptocurrency&#8217;s challenges and opportunities.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, in March, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/indonesias-financial-regulator-issues-new-crypto-regulations-ahead-of-january-2025-transition.htm">the OJK released new rules that will cover cryptocurrencies</a> and will come into force in January 2025. These fresh directives are designed to strengthen the financial industry by guiding how digital financial assets, including cryptocurrencies, should be managed.</p>
<p>The directives emphasize leveraging novel technologies as opportunities arise and scrutinizing the digital operations of financial institutions. They also prioritize customer protection, pilot testing of technological innovations, and reporting test results to ensure transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>While specific technical details are not yet available, introducing these regulations signifies OJK&#8217;s proactive approach to preparing to assume control over crypto regulation in 2025.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Anthropic, founded in 2021 by former members of OpenAI, has emerged as a notable competitor to ChatGPT with its own AI chatbot named Claude. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company recently unveiled Claude 3, its most advanced version capable of analyzing images alongside its chat capabilities.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Ethereum network has surpassed one million validators, with approximately 32 million Ether, worth around $114 billion, staked within the network.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://dune.com/hildobby/eth2-staking" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">data from the Dune Analytics dashboard</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which tracks Ethereum staking progress, the validator count reached the one million mark on March 28. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 32 million ETH staked represents approximately 26% of the total supply, highlighting the substantial commitment to Ethereum&#8217;s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.</span></p>

<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span data-preserver-spaces="true">Among the staking options available, about 30% of the ETH is staked through Lido, an Ethereum staking pool that allows users with smaller amounts of ETH to pool their assets and participate in the staking process.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Validators play a crucial role in maintaining the security of the Ethereum blockchain by monitoring transactions for any malicious activities, such as double-spending. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canadian authorities have filed a third “unexplained wealth order” application with the British Columbia Supreme Court targeting the co-founder of QuadrigaCX Michael Patryn to explain how assets were acquired.</p>
<p>QuadrigaCX filed for bankruptcy in Canada in 2018 after its CEO, Gerald Cotten, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bankrupt-quadrigacx-exchange-commence-interim-distribution-of-funds.htm">died under mysterious circumstances in India,</a> taking the only known private keys to the exchange’s wallets with him. Although some of the funds owed to the exchange’s customers have been paid back, large amounts are still missing.</p>
<p>This latest unexplained wealth order application allows the Canadian authorities to take over assets linked to QuadrigaCX case.</p>
<p>“Today, we have filed our third unexplained wealth order application with the British Columbia Supreme Court – a strong demonstration of our government’s commitment to take decisive action against criminals and organized crime,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General for British Columbia, in a <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2024PSSG0022-000430">statement.</a></p>
<p>The QuadrigaCX case has been much publicized in recent years, and was the subject of a popular 2022 Netflix documentary.</p>
<h2>Cash, Gold Bars, Rolex Watches Seized</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The order will allow the forfeiture of $250,200 in cash, 45 gold bars, four luxury watches and a number of pieces of expensive jewelry <span>contained in a safety deposit box belonging to QuadrigaCX co-founder Patryn.</span></p>
<p>“The international, criminal actions of Quadriga Coin Exchange (QuadrigaCX) led to thousands of people losing their life savings,” said Farnworth.</p>
<p>“While the fallout of cryptocurrency theft that leaves many victims in its wake is topical, what is even more timely is the recovery of these ill-gotten funds and converting them to community benefits in a public way,” said Farnworth.</p>
<h2>Proceeds From Crime Redirected to Victims</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Canadian official went on to stress that authorities will continue to take the assets from unlawful activity and redirect those proceeds made from crime to much-needed victim services programs and crime prevention initiatives, such as the anti-hate grants to communities announced on Feb. 15, 2024.</p>
<p>“Gold bars may be highly liquid and flashy luxury goods, such as jewelry and Rolex watches, attract attention, but they are also attracting the attention of police and our government. If they are the proceeds of criminal activity like fraud, drug trafficking or money laundering, we will go after them,” said Farnworth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blackrocks-ibit-reports-another-320m-in-inflows.htm">BlackRock</a>&#8216;s foray into blockchain with its tokenized fund BUIDL has quickly captured investors’ attention, securing $240 million in deposits.</p>
<p>According to a recent report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-27/blackrock-tokenized-fund-draws-160-million-in-week-since-debut">Bloomberg</a>, BlackRock&#8217;s money-market fund, which utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to record share ownership, reached the astonishing milestone within the first week after its launch.</p>
<h2><span>BlackRock&#8217;s Tokenization Solution</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
BUIDL targets investments in secure assets such as cash, US Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Investors in the fund are issued BUIDL tokens, each pegged at a stable value of $1, to represent their share ownership.</p>
<p>The fund allows for the tokenized shares to be transferred between digital wallets that have been authorized by Securitize, BlackRock’s partner in this venture.</p>
<p>Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, outlines the fund&#8217;s utility across multiple scenarios. Primarily, it serves crypto companies and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) looking to manage their treasuries directly on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fund is positioned as a foundational asset for crypto projects aiming to develop derivatives based on Treasury bills. This opened up new avenues for leveraging traditional financial instruments within the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>Domingo also said that BUIDL is offered as an alternative to stablecoins, providing a secure option for transactions, borrowing, and trading activities.</p>
<p>“It’s very institutional, it is managed by the largest asset manager in the world,” stated Domingo. “There’s no counterparty risk to any crypto company.”</p>
<h2><span>Ondo Finance Invests $95 Million in BUIDL</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Nathan Allman, founder of the crypto startup Ondo Finance, told Bloomberg that the company has allocated $95 million already to invest in BlackRock&#8217;s BUIDL fund, consisting about 40% of the total deposits.</p>
<p>Securitize Markets, registered with the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-to-seek-2-billion-fines-and-penalties-from-ripple-labs-garlinghouse.htm">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) and holding a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) broker-dealer license, enables token transfers among clients as an alternative solution.</p>
<p>Domingo also touched on the SEC’s lack of regulatory clarity, saying that the Commission has yet to provide guidelines on whether <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-government-backed-technology-group-encourages-tokenization-collaboration-among-firms.htm">tokenization</a> should occur on private or public blockchains.</p>

<h2><span>BlackRock&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF Surges to $17 Billion under CEO&#8217;s Bullish Outlook</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, expressed a &#8220;very bullish&#8221; stance on Bitcoin, coinciding with the firm&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), amassing over $17 billion in assets.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>This growth not only contributes to a more liquid Bitcoin market but also solidifies IBIT&#8217;s position as a major player, second only to Grayscale in Bitcoin ETF holdings. The recent approval of Hashdex&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF further energizes the competitive sphere.</p>

<h2><span>Casa Unveils Inheritance Solution for Secure Bitcoin and Crypto Transfers</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Casa, renowned for its Bitcoin self-custody services, has launched an innovative inheritance feature, making the transfer of digital assets seamless for users post-mortem.</p>
<p>This strategic move targets the often overlooked complexity of cryptocurrency inheritance, ensuring users can securely manage their Bitcoin, Ether, Tether, and USD Coin holdings with ease.</p>
<p>By nominating beneficiaries for their token vaults, Casa&#8217;s users pave the way for a smooth transition of assets upon their demise. Beneficiaries, in turn, are required to establish a Casa account, import encrypted keys, and request access, facilitating a secure asset transfer process.</p>
<p>Casa&#8217;s introduction of a five-key vault further bolsters this security framework.

<h2 class="c-message_attachment">Bitcoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC/USD)</a> exhibits a promising outlook, momentarily trading above the pivotal $68,558 mark, suggesting a bullish momentum. </span></p>
<p><span>The cryptocurrency faces immediate resistance at $71,677, with subsequent thresholds at $73,383 and $75,692 potentially capping gains. Support levels at $66,844, $63,820, and $60,763 offer a safety net against downturns. </span></p>

<p><span>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 56 and a bullish engulfing candle on the 4-hour chart bolster the potential for upward movement, especially if Bitcoin sustains above the $68,500 benchmark. </span></p>
<p><span>However, slipping below this critical level could precipitate a significant sell-off, marking a crucial juncture for Bitcoin&#8217;s near-term trajectory.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Both the US and the UK foreign sanctions bodies have targeted online media outlet Gaza Now for aiding Hamas fundraise $21,000 in crypto.</p>
<p>Gaza Now has been promoting crypto donation campaigns and ramped-up these efforts particularly after the October 7 attack in Israel.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department’s <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20240327">Office of Foreign Asset Control</a> (OFAC) and the U.K.’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66040453e8c4420011220329/Counter-Terrorism__Domestic_.pdf">Office of Foreign Sanctions Implementation</a> (OFSI) have also issued sanctions against Mustafa Ayash, the founder of Gaza Now, as well as others and entities associated with the fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>The media entity provided donation options for crypto and fiat and also had references to Aakhirah Limited, which was also sanctioned by OFAC parallelly with Gaza Now. The sanction list also applies to Aakhirah’s director Aozma Sultana.</p>
<figure id="attachment_190788" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190788" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-190788" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28073550/1711611349-gaza-now.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="421" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28073550/1711611349-gaza-now.jpg 716w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28073550/1711611349-gaza-now-300x213.jpg 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28073550/1711611349-gaza-now-150x106.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-190788" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Chainalysis</figcaption></figure>
<p>“Treasury remains committed to degrading Hamas’ ability to finance its terrorist activities, including through online fundraising campaigns that seek to funnel money directly to the group,” US Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence Brian E. Nelson said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The United States, in close coordination with our British partners, will continue to leverage our tools to disrupt Hamas’ ability to facilitate further attacks.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Though Gaza Now received huge in donations, crypto contributions amounted to only $21,000 in the weeks after October 7, per blockchain analytics company Elliptic.</p>
<p>The UK Treasury announced a full asset freeze against two suspects who reportedly provided financial support to Gaza Now.</p>
<p>“All funds and economic resources in the UK belonging to or controlled by Sultana and Ayash have been frozen.”</p>
<h2>Gaza Now’s Inflows</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per Chainalysis report, the vast majority of Gaza Now’s total inflows received over $4.4 million in cryptocurrency. These funds have come primarily from mainstream exchanges.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Gaza Now’s personal wallets have received just above $40,000 in inflows across a variety of cryptos.</p>
<p>Further, these terrorist financing entities prefer using <a href="https://cryptonews.com/tags/tether/">Tether</a> (USDT) on the TRON blockchain, particularly in 2023. According to TRM labs, this saw a 125% increase in <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/in-wake-of-attack-on-israel-understanding-how-hamas-uses-crypto">TRON addresses</a> linked to terrorist financing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on Tuesday <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-warns-firms-and-finfluencers-keep-their-social-media-ads-lawful"><span>issued new guidelines</span></a> for financial services promotions on social media. These apply to formats like memes, reels, and gaming streams, highlighting the need for fairness and avoiding any misleading information.</p>
<p>In a press release, the regulator said that companies are responsible for all their promotional content, including that created by influencers.</p>
<p>Promoting a financial product without the requisite authorization from a duly qualified FCA-authorized person constitutes a potential criminal offense, it warned.</p>
<p>“Consumers need to be alert to dubious adverts and scams online, but it is important that influencers ensure they’re on the right side of the rules and consider what would happen to their own reputations if they’re found to promote products illegally,” the watchdog said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whether it’s a meme, reel or TikTok, firms are responsible for all their promotions, even if they’re working with influencers. Read more about our new finalised guidance on financial promotions on social media:  <a href="https://t.co/N6ipxZ34Rp">https://t.co/N6ipxZ34Rp</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FinancialPromotions?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FinancialPromotions</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FinancialServices?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FinancialServices</a> <a href="https://t.co/vjfn2evrHP">pic.twitter.com/vjfn2evrHP</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Financial Conduct Authority (@TheFCA) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheFCA/status/1772586859509547469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>FCA Removed Misleading Advertisements in 2023</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
“Promotions aren’t just about the likes, they’re about the law,” said Lucy Castledine, director of consumer investments at the FCA. “We will take action against those touting financial products illegally.”</p>
<p>The financial regulator has intensified its oversight of financial promotions. Last year, it removed a higher number of misleading advertisements compared to 2022.</p>
<p>This increased scrutiny follows the implementation of stricter rules for advertising high-risk investments, including crypto. In July 2023, the FCA <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/letter-to-cryptoasset-firms-financial-promotions-regime.pdf"><span>issued specific guidelines</span></a> on how companies must disclose information about crypto-related products across various online platforms.</p>
<h2>FCA&#8217;s Agenda for Market Integrity and Consumer Protection</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The regulations extend to crypto businesses operating internationally, provided their advertising reaches UK residents. Non-compliance can lead to severe penalties, including imprisonment for up to two years and potentially unlimited fines.</p>
<p>Further, the FCA <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/uk-fca-plans-to-implement-market-abuse-regime-for-crypto-in-2024.htm"><span>recently outlined plans</span></a><span> to strengthen its ability to identify and address crypto market abuse over the next year. Its business plan prioritizes consumer protection and market integrity. It also aims to foster international competitiveness within the financial sector.</span></p>
<p><span>This initiative comes as the UK establishes itself as a major player in the global crypto space. FCA research indicates a doubling of digital asset ownership within the country between 2021 and 2022.</span></p>
<p><span>The watchdog has faced challenges in enforcing its crypto advertising regulations. Despite issuing guidance and </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/fca-reviewed-44-crypto-firms-registered-in-uk-for-anti-money-laundering-purposes.htm"><span>removing a significant number of non-compliant ads</span></a> (450 alerts issued in 2023 alone), it acknowledged persistent violations by some in the industry.</p>
<p>Still, it remains committed to upholding regulatory compliance will continue taking action against those who breach the rules.</p>

A <a href="https://assets.hcch.net/docs/d6e2d062-7cd0-4f3d-be96-189c12164ab6.pdf"><span>recent proposal</span></a> recommends that the Council on General Affairs and Policy (CGAP) commission a study on the private international law implications of digital tokens, including real estate tokens, utility tokens, payment tokens, NFTs, and stablecoins.</p>
<p>It will exclude securities, central bank digital currencies, and carbon credits.  That is because they are already under consideration in a separate project.</p>
<p>The study aims to deliver a report with recommendations for future action to the CGAP by a scheduled meeting in 2025.</p>
<h2>Joint Project Identifies Tokenization as a Key Focus Area</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Further, the project will be conducted alongside relevant specialists and external observers.</p>
<p>Members will be invited to nominate relevant experts for the study. These experts will include legal and technical specialists in digital tokens, as well as individuals with experience in national digital token initiatives.</p>
<p>Following the adoption of digital asset principles in 2023, the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) collaborated with the HCCH on a joint project. Through a series of meetings, they proposed potential areas for future work.</p>
<p>They focused on areas including: applying existing custody rules (defined by UNIDROIT) to situations beyond traditional custody, and exploring the legal implications of &#8220;linked assets&#8221; (tokenized assets).</p>
<p>Established financial institutions are increasingly interested in the potential of tokenization.</p>
<p>Moody&#8217;s recently highlighted a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tokenized-funds-skyrocketed-to-800m-value-in-2023-sparked-by-us-treasury-tokenization-moodys.htm"><span>dramatic rise in the value of tokenized funds</span></a><span>, driven by US treasury tokenization. Similarly, </span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bank-of-america-forecasts-transformative-role-of-tokenization-finance.htm"><span>Bank of America anticipates</span></a> tokenization will transform financial and non-financial markets within the next few years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said he is “bullish on the long term viability of Bitcoin” and thinks an ETH exchange traded fund (ETF) may still be possible even if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brands ETH a security.</p>
<p>In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, BlackRock&#8217;s Fink was asked about the recently launched iShares Bitcoin Trust trading under the ticker symbol &#8220;IBIT&#8221; and the huge inflows.</p>
<p><span>“IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs. Nothing has been getting assets as fast as IBIT,&#8221; responded Fink. </span></p>
<h2>BlackRock CEO Bullish Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span>“I&#8217;m very bullish on the long-term viability of Bitcoin,&#8221; said Fink. &#8220;I mean, look as we&#8217;re creating a market that has more liquidity and more transparency &#8212; and I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised &#8230; I would never have predicted it before we filed it [IBIT] that we were going to see this type of retail [demand]” adds Fink.</span></p>
<p>The Fox Business host went on to ask Fink about the ETH ETFs and the <span><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/what-happens-if-the-sec-brands-eth-a-security.htm">SEC making lots of noise about declaring ETH</a> a security which will take it out of the Bitcoin category as a commodity. How would this impact BlackRock&#8217;s ETH ETF application? </span></p>
<p>Fink stressed he cannot discuss the BlackRock ETH ETF application in more detail but when pushed by the host about what will happen if the SEC brands ETH a security &#8212; it is still possible to start a ETH ETF?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; responded Fink.</p>
<h2 class="mb-10">What Happens if the SEC Brands ETH a Security?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Currently the status of Ethereum is in limbo – ETH is not considered a security by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — but this <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-reportedly-probing-key-crypto-companies-in-push-to-make-eth-a-security-fortune.htm">could all change very quickly</a>.</p>
<p>It has been <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/sec-reportedly-probing-key-crypto-companies-in-push-to-make-eth-a-security-fortune.htm">widely reported</a> that a number of U.S. based companies have received subpoenas attempting to label ETH as a security.</p>
<p>Ethereum is viewed as a decentralized cryptocurrency, rather than a security. However, regulatory agencies like the SEC continue to monitor the cryptocurrency space and may provide further guidance and sudden change or new rulings in the future. It’s essential to stay updated on regulatory developments.</p>
<h2>SEC Will “Kick the Can Down the Road”</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
<span></span><span>According to HANetf founder and co-CEO Hector McNeil the SEC reviewing</span><span> ETH as a security is one way to delay its decision to approve ETH ETFs by “kicking the can down the road.”</span></p>
<p><span>If the SEC moves ahead to reclassify ETH as a security this </span><span>would terminate any SEC applications with ETH ETFs in its current form, explains Laurent Kssis, head of CEC Capital.</span></p>
<p>“You cannot change an asset overnight from commodity to securities as the ETH futures are considered defacto non-security and not within the scope of the CFTC and not within its regulatory framework,” Kssis told Cryptonews in an interview.</p>

<p><span><a href="https://tradingview.com/symbols/SHIBUSD/">Shiba Inu (SHIB/USD)</a> has recently experienced a slight decline, trading at $0.000030 </span><span>with a 24-hour volume of $1,543,917,018, experienced nearly 3.50% dip, yet its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/">market cap</a> stands robust at $17,789,281,901, ranking it 11th. </span></p>
<p><span>Amidst this fluctuation, speculations about reaching the elusive $1 mark intensify, underscored by its vast circulating supply of 589 trillion coins. </span></p>
<p><span>This analysis delves into <a href="https://cryptonews.com/price-predictions/shiba-inu-price-prediction/">Shiba Inu&#8217;s price predictions</a>, considering its market dynamics and investor sentiment, to gauge the possibility of such a milestone.</span></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Prediction</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Shiba Inu&#8217;s pivot point is set at $0.000029 which is serving as a baseline for potential upward movement, with immediate resistance observed at $0.000032.</p>
<p>Subsequent barriers at $0.000035 and $0.000038 could challenge bullish advances.</p>
<p>Conversely, support levels at $0.000026, $0.000024, and $0.000020 provide safety nets against further declines.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shiba Inu shows bullish potential. Pivot point at $0.000029. <br />Resistance at $0.000032, $0.000035, $0.000038. Support at $0.000026, $0.000024, $0.000020 <br />RSI at 58 and 50-day EMA at $0.000029 bolster optimism, yet a breach below could signal a downturn. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SHIB</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoForecast?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CryptoForecast</a> <a href="https://t.co/CsyoJCr3PM">pic.twitter.com/CsyoJCr3PM</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI), standing at 58, suggest a favorable buying environment, potentially buoying SHIB&#8217;s ascent.</p>
<figure id="attachment_190708" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190708" style="width: 1751px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-190708" src="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28042836/1711600115-image_2024-03-28_092834117.png" alt="Shiba Inu" width="1751" height="911" srcset="https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28042836/1711600115-image_2024-03-28_092834117.png 1751w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28042836/1711600115-image_2024-03-28_092834117-300x156.png 300w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28042836/1711600115-image_2024-03-28_092834117-1024x533.png 1024w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28042836/1711600115-image_2024-03-28_092834117-768x400.png 768w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28042836/1711600115-image_2024-03-28_092834117-1536x799.png 1536w, https://cimg.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/28042836/1711600115-image_2024-03-28_092834117-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1751px) 100vw, 1751px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-190708" class="wp-caption-text">Shiba Inu Price Forecast</figcaption></figure>
<p>Moreover, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.000029 corroborates a bullish sentiment, provided SHIB sustains above this threshold.</p>
<p>A notable formation, the double top pattern at $0.000031, introduces a resistance level that could cap gains unless decisively breached.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Shiba Inu&#8217;s market behavior exhibits a bullish potential above the critical $0.000029 mark.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, traders should remain vigilant, as a drop below this level could precipitate a significant sell-off.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-halvings-role-in-shaping-crypto-future-tether-co-founder.htm">Tether Co-Founder William Quigley on How Bitcoin Halving Will Reshape Crypto Markets</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin halving stands as a significant event within the cryptocurrency sphere, signaling a shift for miners, institutions, and the overall market.</p>
<p>This scheduled occurrence, happening roughly every four years, is expected to take place this April and would directly impact Bitcoin&#8217;s supply by reducing the mining reward by half, a core aspect designed to preserve its value over time.</p>
<p>In a conversation with Cryptonews.com, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/exclusive-interview-tether-co-founder-says-crypto-industry-will-bounce-back-despite-past-failures-heres-why.htm">William Quigley</a>, a venture capitalist who co-founded the stablecoin issuer <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/tethers-usdt-reaches-monumental-100-billion-market-cap-milestone.htm">Tether</a> and the NFT platform WAX.io, delved into the broader effects of Bitcoin halving.</p>
<p>Quigley elaborated on the intricacies of Bitcoin halving, its direct impact on the crypto market, and particularly, how it affects both miners and individual investors.</p>
<h2><span>Bitcoin to Reach $300,000 by 2025 End</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Quigley first touched on Bitcoin’s price forecast <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-to-hit-360000-one-year-post-halving-coinledger.htm">post-halving</a>, elaborating how the market would adjust to the event based on previous records.</p>
<p>“There is a historically Bitcoin prices increased the months following the Bitcoin halving,” said Quigley. “For the first halving in November 2012, Bitcoin went up 100 times from its pre happening level, $12 to $1,200.”</p>
<p>“The second halving, it went up about 30 times, from $650 to $20,000. And the third halving, it went up eight times, from $8,500 to about $19,500,” he said.</p>
<p>Though Bitcoin price has always been surging following the halving events, Quigley pointed out that the multiple has kept dropping, from 100 times, to 30 times, and the most recent eight times.</p>
<p>“So, you know, maybe four times, three times this time,” he predicted. If Bitcoin price were to regain the $70,000 level by [presumably] April 20, four times of its value could exceed the $300,000 mark.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tether co-founder on why Bitcoin could reach $300k at the peak of the next bull market <a href="https://t.co/iZhPjoVS7V">https://t.co/iZhPjoVS7V</a></p>
<p>&mdash; William E. Quigley (@WilliamEQuigley) <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamEQuigley/status/1764793317588361439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Quigley also incorporated historical statistics of the previous post-halving rally cycles, suggesting that it would take 500 days to 18 months for Bitcoin to hit the next all-time high, which would be October 2025 for this fourth event.</p>
<h2><span>Bitcoin Halving’s Impact on Miners and Investors</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The crypto veteran continued to analyze the chain of reactions from Bitcoin miners, individual investors, and financial institutions post-halving.</p>

<p>&#8220;In order for Bitcoin to continue to function the way it&#8217;s supposed to, we need to be reducing the number of daily Bitcoin mined,&#8221; said Quigley &#8220;So we&#8217;ll drop from 900 to 450 beginning [presumably] on April 20.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reduction of mining rewards would then pose significant challenges and opportunities for the miners. &#8220;Now, a few months ago when Bitcoin was like 40,000, most of the Bitcoin miners were profitable&#8230; At 67,000, what it is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">today</a>, they&#8217;re very profitable,&#8221; said Quigley.</p>
<p>Even if Bitcoin price may skyrocket to boost the profit margin of mining operations, the competition will probably intensify proportionally as more industry players seek to benefit from the rally.</p>
<p>For individual investors, the halving event presents a nuanced landscape. Quigley&#8217;s advice leans towards a long-term investment horizon.</p>
<p>Unlike a traditional company which has makes its own profits and releases new products, Quigley emphasized that Bitcoin operates as an open-source platform maintained and utilized by a community of independent users.</p>
<p>Therefore, traditional financial metrics cannot determine Bitcoin&#8217;s value. “Bitcoin is valued purely by sentiment of the people who are buying and selling it,” said Quigley.</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re trying to trade on sentiment on a daily basis, that sentiment is random. It goes up and down throughout the day. I wouldn&#8217;t trade it,” shared Quigley. “If you are going to buy Bitcoin first or any crypto, it should be a very, very small percentage of your net worth.”</p>
<p>“Also, never buy crypto unless you are able to hold it for five years,” he added. “Which doesn&#8217;t mean you do hold it for five years, but you have the ability to hold it for five years.”</p>
<h2><span>More Crypto Quant Trading Firms Post Bitcoin Halving</span></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Regarding institutional players in the industry, the Tether and WAX co-founder argued that more quant trading firms specialized in crypto investment will emerge post-having due to the soaring trading volume.</p>
<p>“In the first halving in 2012, the amount of trading volume on a daily basis was probably less than a million dollars,” said Quigley. “By the third happening in 2020, we were doing $15 billion to $30 billion a day, up to a hundred billion.”</p>
<p>“When you have that much trading and crypto trades 24 hours a day, seven days a week, there are price disparities that people can exploit” he explained.</p>
<p>“The primary trading volume of Bitcoin is in Bitcoin futures, if you can use leverage to exploit those, you can make a lot and you can also lose a lot,” said Quigley. “But the futures markets will always attract people who think they can take advantage of some price difference and make a lot.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A South Korean civil servant was arrested on March 27 on charges of committing crypto-related fraud and carrying out voice <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/trezor-clarifies-security-breach-phishing-attack-identified-as-cause-of-compromised-x-account.htm">phishing</a> attacks.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fnnews.com/news/202403270840492946" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fn News</a>, the accused is a level six district office official in her 50s. Police said she “received money from multiple victims.”</p>
<p>Police say she converted the fiat to <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>. She then reportedly sent the coins to a “voice phishing gang member.”</p>
<h2>South Korean Civil Servant ‘Worked for Voice Phishing Gang’</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Police in Seoul’s Dongdaemun District said they had arrested the woman “on charges of fraud” at a bank in the Jegi Neighborhood.</p>
<p>Officers said that the civil servant “converted over $74,000 worth of her voice phishing fraud funds into Bitcoin.”</p>
<p>She then allegedly sent the coins “to a voice phishing organization member.” This person allegedly paid her “a fee” for her activities.</p>

(Source: Brit in Seoul [CC BY-SA 4.0])</figcaption></figure>The woman reportedly stated she was “deceived” into joining the gang by an individual. This person, she claimed, said she could make money “through legitimate means.”</p>
<p>A police spokesperson said officers were still “investigating evidence.” Officers said they were also “identifying potential additional victims.”</p>
<p>Officers said they had searched addresses connected to the civil servant, and were now examining additional data.</p>
<p>Police said they were “conducting an investigation” into whether the public official had used “information she learned at work” to prey on potential victims.</p>
<h2>Rise in Crypto Crime?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
In recent years, police have noted <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/south-korean-crypto-chat-app-channel-scams-on-the-rise-warn-police.htm">an uptick in crypto-related crimes</a>, including voice phishing. Attackers often pose as civil servants, tax service workers, or bank employees.</p>
<p>They often tell potential victims that their bank accounts are under attack or that they are being investigated for tax-related offenses.</p>
<p>Attackers often tell victims that they have the power to solve these issues, and invariably request bank or crypto transfers to help “fund” their “solutions.”</p>
<p>In June 2023, the nation was <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/s-korean-govt-worker-embezzled-public-funds-escaped-with-28m-of-crypto.htm">stunned by the case of a government worker who allegedly escaped to the Philippines after stealing around $3.5 million from the National Health Insurance Corporation (NHIC)</a>.</p>
<p>The NHIC operates South Korean nursing care funds. The civil servant allegedly embezzled the money from April 2022 to September 2022.</p>
<p>He then reportedly converted the money to crypto. He then allegedly fled to live a “life of luxury” at an expensive resort in the Philippines.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/police-catch-south-koreas-3-5m-nursing-care-fund-crypto-thief.htm">Local police arrested the man in January this year</a>, and he was repatriated to face charges shortly after.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russian government bodies, the <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/us-treasury-russia-blockchain-firms-sanctions-evasion.htm">nation</a>’s anti-money laundering agency, and the Central Bank have reportedly “come to a consensus” on crypto policy.</p>
<p>The breakthrough could finally put an end to a <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-central-bank-says-no-as-ministries-hope-to-legalize-bitcoin-mining.htm">long-standing crypto impasse</a> in Moscow. It could also see Russia belatedly start regulating the crypto sector.</p>
<h2>Russian Government’s Crypto ‘Breakthrough’</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
According to the media outlet <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/crypto/news/6602839b9a79477a4387e9ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RBC</a>, the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and Rosfinmonitoring have “agreed on an approach to regulating cryptocurrencies.”</p>
<p>Rosfinmonitoring is the country’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing agency. It has recently called for Moscow to fast-track crypto regulations after <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russia-fatf-rating-downgraded-due-to-insufficient-crypto-regulation.htm">the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) downgraded Russia’s compliance rating</a>.</p>
<p>The FATF noted that Russia had adopted “insufficient regulation of virtual assets and cryptocurrencies” at a February 23 plenary meeting.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have been at loggerheads over crypto policy for years.</p>
<p>The ministry wants to regulate crypto and legalize industrial mining. It also wants to let Russian firms use crypto as an international payment tool.</p>
<p>Miners this month<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-crypto-industry-sends-government-draft-mining-bill.htm"> petitioned ministries</a> in a third concerted effort to have their industry placed on an official register of licensed business activities.</p>
<p>Ministries have responded “positively,” Russian reports have claimed. However, <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-ministries-discuss-crypto-mining-legalization-but-theres-a-twist.htm">the Russian government is not united on the matter</a>.</p>
<p>The nation’s trade and industry ministry is reportedly unhappy with the proposal.</p>
<p>However, the acting director of the Financial Policy Department of the Ministry of Finance, Alexey Yakovlev, said “both the state and market participants” were interested in legalizing the industry.</p>
<p>Miners have claimed Moscow can expect to raise millions of dollars worth of tax every year from their<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/bitriver-to-build-new-100mw-crypto-mining-center-in-russia.htm"> booming industry</a>.</p>
<p>They have also claimed that if Moscow nurtures their industry, Russia will be able to displace the United States as the world’s biggest crypto mining power.</p>

<h2>Third Time Lucky for Russian Crypto Miners?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
The Ministry of Finance has reportedly begun drafting a bill that will deal with matters related to crypto mining.</p>
<p>The same ministry’s last attempt to create a crypto bill resulted in abject failure in 2022, when the Central Bank countered <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-mps-dismiss-central-banks-calls-for-crypto-ban.htm">with its own rival bill</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The crypto-skeptic Central Bank’s 2022 bill proposed a China-style ban on almost all forms of crypto-related activities.</p>
<h2>Crypto Consensus Forming in Moscow?</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
However, Yakovlev offered hope. He said that both the bank and Rosfinmonitoring were “consulting” with the ministry on the draft bill.</p>
<p>Yakovlev said the bill would address matters including how miners must handle coins. The bank has previously said it <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/russian-central-bank-ready-make-crypto-regulation-concessions-hints-governor.htm">will only countenance crypto mining if miners swap their coins for fiat on overseas crypto trading platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies have expressed their destain for this plan, saying that it will “open the door to money laundering.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>RBC also quoted a Ministry of Finance spokesperson as “expressing the hope” that the State Duma would “be able to consider a bill on the regulation of cryptocurrencies” in the current session.</p>
<p>Yakovlev has previously said it “would be pointless” for the Russian government to “attempt to ban crypto mining.”</p>
<p>In March 2022, he poured cold water on ministry proposals to ban “private” mining – and “legalize” industrial the mining sector.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Laser Digital says its Polygon Fund can produce better liquid staking yield than investors normally earn through Lido.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/laser-digital-polygon-fund-liquid-staking.htm">Laser Digital Introduces Polygon Fund with Liquid Staking for Institutional Clients</a> appeared first on <a href="https://cryptonews.com">Cryptonews</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laser Digital – the crypto-focused subsidiary of Japanese asset manager Nomura – has launched an institutionally focused liquid staking fund on Polygon in collaboration with TruFin.</p>
<p>The fund, titled the Laser Digital Polygon Adoption Fund, will provide institutional clients with exposure to Polygon’s native gas token, MATIC, while also tapping into native staking rewards.</p>
<h2><strong>Liquid Staking With Laser Digital</strong></h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Per a press release shared with <em>Cryptonews</em>, the fund is specifically targeted toward sovereign wealth funds, institutional funds, and private asset managers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Institutional investors are beginning to understand the benefits and necessity of decentralized security, and this Fund shows that institutions are compelled by the broader ecosystem,” noted Laser Digital.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://stakingrewards.com">stakingrewards.com</a>, the estimated annual staking reward for MATIC stakers is currently 5.94%. However, using the TruStake liquid staking solution, fund investors can access yield consistnetly higher than Lido’s 5% average while maintaining the freedom to sell their tokens at any time.</p>
<p>TruFin has already partnered with Balacner and Chainlink to maximize the liquidity of the TruMATIC token.</p>
<p>The fund takes advantage of the Polygon AggLayer, which aggregates zero-knowledge proofs from all connected blockchains, boosting liqudiidty and transaction speed while maximizing the fund’s operational efficiency. It will first become available to investors in the United Kingdom following relevant registrations and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>“Laser Digital Asset Management aims to transform DeFi investment opportunities into investable TradFi solutions,” said Sebastien Guglietta, Head of Laser Digital Asset Management.</p>
<p>“Leveraging TruFin technology and its integration with Polygon’s AggLayer, we are making Polygon-Matic digital asset investment accessible, in the most secure, and efficient way for institutional investors.”</p>
<h2>Another Boon For Polygon Adoption</h2>
<p><span class="replacer"></span><br />
Colin Butler, Global Head of Institutional Capital at Polygon, added that getting institutional investors involved with staking would boost the overall security of the Polygon network.</p>
<p>Polygon is one of the leading layer 2 scaling networks for Ethereum (ETH) – the largest smart contract blockchain by volume and market cap.</p>
<p>Thanks to Ethereum’s recent Denucun upgrade, the cost of “rollups” on Polygon – batches of transactions that are later settled to the Ethereum blockchain – is expected to drastically fall following the latter’s Feijoa update. It&#8217;s also a slight boon for Polygon staking, since Ethereum L1 settlement costs became slightly cheaper.</p>
<p>While liquid staking is DeFi’s most popular use case, prominent developers like Vitalik Buterin have warned that the phenomenon is pushing networks like Ethereum <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-staking.htm">toward centralization</a>.</p>
