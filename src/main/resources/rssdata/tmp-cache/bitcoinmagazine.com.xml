                    <p>As the Argentine economy is racked by record inflation, its people are turning to Bitcoin as a way to protect their economic security.</p><p>The Argentine Republic is currently experiencing the worst <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Argentina#Inflation">inflation</a> rates in the world. The nation’s economy has experienced low levels of inflation, somewhere around 25%, for decades; yet the pandemic sharpened a downward trend to devastating effect. The inflation rate hit 70% in 2022 and reached 100% the following February, but 2023 proved to be an absolutely murderous year for Argentina's economy. Inflation rates <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi">crossed</a> the 200% point around the time that Bitcoin-<a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/argentinas-new-president-is-pro-bitcoin">friendly</a> president Javier Milei first took office in December, and the rate currently sits at a mind-boggling 274%. With figures like this, ordinary citizens’ wages and life savings have evaporated practically overnight, and people are looking towards more radical solutions to get their lives on track.</p><figure>

                    <p>In a particularly encouraging development, ordinary citizens are turning to Bitcoin in record numbers for its classic use-case as a store of value. Already a nation with a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-19/bitcoin-gains-dim-argentines-dollar-refuge-with-276-inflation">high</a> rate of Bitcoin acceptance, Argentina has doubled down on the decentralized currency as the most popular local exchange reports 20-month highs in trading volume. Lemon Cash, the exchange in question, claimed that Bitcoin transactions in the first full week of March 2024 were more than double the average rate throughout 2023. Belo, another prominent exchange based in the country, reported year-to-year increases that were closer to tenfold. A particularly interesting wrinkle in the development is that Bitcoin is not only replacing dollars, but also dollar-backed stablecoins which saw trading volumes decrease by 60-70%. Belo’s CEO Manuel Beaudroit stated that “The user decides to buy Bitcoin when they see the news that the currency is going up, while stablecoin is more pragmatic and many times used for transactional purposes, as a vehicle to make payments abroad”.</p><p>Ironically, <em>Bloomberg</em> claims, some of President Milei’s economic positions have actually influenced the switch from the dollar to Bitcoin, but through some unexpected and indirect means. The radical libertarian has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/947ec43d-9694-423f-a645-ada46c1677e6">begun</a> his administration with a series of broad-reaching reforms to try and control the situation, reducing spending and attempting to dismantle or privatize a variety of state-owned businesses. A particular goal of his administration to date has been to build a budget <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/argentina-logs-second-straight-fiscal-surplus-in-feb-on-milei-austerity">surplus</a> for the federal government, for a variety of reasons: using these funds more deliberately, reaching targets based on agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and of course beginning a positive trend in Argentina’s economic statistics. A <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-greenback-love-is-being-substituted-by-a-bitcoin-rush/">component</a> of this surplus policy has been to build a similar reserve of American greenbacks, reducing their circulation within the country. The exchange rate of pesos to dollars took a serious hit, and the once-popular store of value became less attractive than the skyrocketing Bitcoin.</p><p><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/latin-america-cryptocurrency-adoption/">Reports</a> from Chainalysis put some hard numbers onto these general trends: Argentina leads all of Latin America in transaction volume, and is second place overall in terms of grassroots adoption. Representatives from Lemon Cash estimated in this report that the number of Argentinians using Bitcoin or other digital currencies is around 5M, out of a population of 45M! Such impressive figures are not merely the result of a brief period of economic misfortune, but should instead be considered as a sort of tipping point: Bitcoin acceptance has been quietly growing for years, and now the crisis is providing the jump for it to become a fully mainstream fiat alternative. The rate of growth has been so prodigious that an unexpected “cousin” of the industry has even been developing, with crypto-related <a href="https://crypto.news/bitcoin-interest-in-argentina-hits-20-month-high-as-inflation-soars-above-270/">scam</a> and phishing activity increasing fivefold. Clearly, the market is full of people new to Bitcoin’s chaotic ecosystem.</p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>Relevant to the rise of unsavory activity targeting new Bitcoin users, Argentina is beginning to pass some new regulations over the industry. The Senate unanimously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentine-senate-passes-reform-creating-cryptocurrency-entities-registry/">passed</a> a new law in March, opening up a new set of standards that virtual asset service providers must adhere to. The standards are generally related to various consumer protection and anti-fraud precautions, with the country’s main securities agency set to enforce these new standards. The existing Bitcoin community has reacted to these new laws with consternation, fearing that this legislation will lead to market consolidation. Large operations, after all, would have the resources to comply with these new requirements immediately, while smaller startups may find themselves swamped. Still, legislators are also working on a series of tax exemptions for digital asset holders, that may hopefully help smooth over some of this animosity.</p><p>Curiously absent from these proceedings, however, is President Milei. The man espoused some pro-Bitcoin views on the campaign trail, and has a general economic philosophy that aligns with some of Bitcoin’s core fundamentals, but nevertheless he has held little public presence in many of Bitcoin’s developments. Even the incidental rise of Bitcoin fueled by his own policies have not led him to make public statements on the situation. Still, Milei has had his hands full from a far-reaching <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2024/03/19/after-100-brutal-days-javier-milei-has-markets-believing">series</a> of economic reforms and austerity policies, balancing the confidence of global markets with a concerning rise in poverty across several metrics. Milei has managed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-inflation-cools-more-than-expected-february-hits-276-annually-2024-03-12/">slow</a> the ballooning inflation somewhat, but at great cost: reduced government spending is pushing more citizens over the brink. As <em>Reuters</em> reported, the crisis is far from over, with sales, activity and production all on a downward slope. </p><p>In other words, it seems likely that Milei personally has Bitcoin on the back burner, as he has a much greater priority in getting the economy under control and tempering the possibility of social unrest. His general popularity is holding up despite these adversities, but a contentious issue like bitcoinization may simply be a battle he is unwilling to start. Once things calm down, we may look forward to his endorsement of Bitcoin once again, but nothing is truly certain. Still, despite his lack of direct Bitcoin-friendly initiatives, the legislature is still making positive moves in its own right. It seems very unlikely that Argentina will turn actively hostile to Bitcoin in the face of this inflation, such as with Nigeria’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1507509b-7bbc-48a1-9828-d777036fff2b">crackdown</a> amidst a <a href="https://theconversation.com/inflation-in-nigeria-is-still-climbing-while-it-has-slowed-globally-heres-why-222226">lagging</a> currency. </p><p>Ultimately, the future of Bitcoin in Argentina is up to the Bitcoiners themselves. Economic crisis has presented the community with record highs in adoption, and Bitcoin is well past a household name. Will this trend continue as the economy recovers? Will a fledgling community of Bitcoin-related businesses and developers end up transformed into a dynamic and profitable industry? There are too many variables to say for certain. Nevertheless, Bitcoin is a chaotic market that was itself founded in the wake of the United States’ own economic woes of the 2008 collapse. The worldwide community has displayed an innovative and enterprising spirit that can lead to success in even the most marginal situations. Bitcoin has been on the rise globally, in other words, and there’s no reason to doubt that it won’t keep rising in Argentina too. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk4NDI1Mjg0MDExNTE4/default_argentinians_bypassing_inflation_with_bitcoin_0.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk4NDI1Mjg0MDExNTE4/default_argentinians_bypassing_inflation_with_bitcoin_0.jpg"><media:title>default_argentinians_bypassing_inflation_with_bitcoin_0</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk4MzU4NDQzNTgzNDQ0/d9539b01-bee6-44a3-9b68-c93d01327356_1505x1095.jpg"><media:title>d9539b01-bee6-44a3-9b68-c93d01327356_1505x1095</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Super Testnet Introduces Hedgehog: A Protocol For Asynchronous Layer 2 Bitcoin Payments]]></title><description><![CDATA[Super Testnet demonstrates how his new invention works.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/super-testnet-introduces-hedgehog-a-protocol-for-asynchronous-layer-2-bitcoin-payments</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/super-testnet-introduces-hedgehog-a-protocol-for-asynchronous-layer-2-bitcoin-payments</guid><category><![CDATA[Super Testnet]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning network]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hedgehog]]></category><category><![CDATA[Layer 2]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2024 18:11:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk2MTc3OTQyMzczODg2/default_hedgehog_and_bitcoin_up_close_0-1.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, a freelance developer focused on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, <a href="https://x.com/super_testnet/status/1772647977892405739?s=20">Super Testnet</a>, <a href="https://stacker.news/items/481321">unveiled</a> his latest invention, Hedgehog, a protocol for asynchronous layer two bitcoin payments.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JeBDVPH1gA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>"This is a protocol similar to the Lightning Network," Super Testnet stated. "And that it is a layer 2 for Bitcoin payments, only in this one, unlike the Lightning Network, the two parties don't have to both be online, it's asynchronous. One party can send the other money then they're offline."</p><p>One of the features of Hedgehog channels is its simplicity compared to lightning channels, according to the project's <a href="https://github.com/supertestnet/hedgehog">Github</a>. State updates in Hedgehog channels only require the sender to propose an update, which the recipient can then accept at their convenience. This asynchronous nature allows for more flexibility and efficiency in payment processing.</p><p>The protocol works by leveraging a primitive in Bitcoin script known as "revocable connectors." These connectors are built on two even more primitive components: revocable scripts and connector outputs. Revocable scripts allow either party to revoke a transaction after a certain period, adding an extra layer of security and control. Connector outputs allow you to construct a pre-signed transaction spending a separate UTXO alongside the connector output, allowing the transaction to be invalidated by spending the connector output by itself. </p><p>To illustrate how Hedgehog channels operate, consider a scenario where Alice opens a channel with Bob by sending a certain amount of bitcoin into a multisig address. Using the revocable connectors, Alice can then send off-chain payments to Bob while he is offline. These payments are embedded in a piece of text, similar to a cheque, and can be sent via email or other communication methods.</p><p>When Bob comes online, he has the option to accept or reject the payment. If he accepts, he can cosign and broadcast the transaction to update the channel balance. If he rejects, he can propose an alternative transaction for Alice to consider.</p><p>One of the potential problems that Hedgehog needs to solve is, for instance, if a party sends money to their counterparty they lose the ability to force close the channel because they do not have the other party’s signature. The protocol provides a conditional revocation mechanism. This mechanism aims to allow the sender to revoke a previous state conditionally, giving both parties a window of time to override the transaction if needed.</p><p>Additionally, Hedgehog addresses the issue of funds being stuck in a multisig address if one party becomes permanently unavailable. By incorporating time-lock conditions into the script, the protocol can ensure that funds can still be accessed after a certain period, even if one party is unable to provide their signature.</p><p>Super Testnet posted that he has an idea for how to use Hedgehog channels to build a federated CoinPool that he named Burrow.

A mechanism to timestamp the order of digital information without needing to depend on a centralized operator. A decentralized mechanism with no one in charge, that provides undeniably cryptographic guarantees around what data was added to the temporal record in what order. This property is the entire reason Bitcoin is useful as a form of digital money, without it there would be no way for the system to function at all without a centralized authority. </p><p>All of these guarantees are provided by three simple technical building blocks: private/public key cryptography, merkle trees, and hash algorithms. Every Bitcoin block is just some extra necessary data wrapped around the root of a merkle tree of all the transactions in it. The rest of the header includes data like the timestamp, difficulty target, block version, the hash of the previous block in the chain, and the random nonce used when hashing the head looking for enough leading 0s. </p><h2>Cryptographic Commitments, Publishing and Verification</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk2NzIxMjU1NzM3MzAw/merkle1.png" height="800" width="1067">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Miners don’t actually hash the whole block, and they don’t have to, because of how a merkle tree works. Each piece of data in a merkle tree is hashed, and then each pair of data units is hashed together upwards until you arrive at the single hash of the merkle root. Simply by mining over the header that includes that single hash, miners can prove beyond the shadow of a doubt all the transactions in the block were part of the block they mined, and that it pointed back to a single previous block with a specific set of prior transactions, and so on. In a similar fashion, when people sign Bitcoin transactions, they aren’t signing over the actual transaction’s raw bytes, they’re signing the hash of them. They’re the same thing in terms of cryptographic commitment. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk2NzI5MDQwMzY1NTI0/merkle3.png" height="298" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>The way cryptographic commitments work in combination with proof-of-work are what guarantee we can have a linear view of what was cryptographically committed to in what order. This is the entire basis of Bitcoin, proof-of-work creating a material cost to adding to that chain, and using that to sequence all of the actual data (transactions) committed to in order to completely verify no funny business occurred. As a miner you can’t “mine” two different Bitcoin blocks at the same time, and you can’t fake digital signatures or break hash functions. </p><p>The entire functioning of the Bitcoin network can be boiled down essentially to two things: committing to information, and publishing that information to be verified. Bitcoin provides two commitment guarantees in terms of data relevant to the protocol: that individual transactions were properly committed to by the correct signatures and other witness data, and that blocks bundling transactions have been committed to by an appropriate amount of work. </p><p>This is what gives value to Bitcoin as a network and system, the commitment guarantees it provides using cryptography and thermodynamics, and publishing them so everyone who wants to can verify those commitments. Without the soundness of its commitments, and the public circulation of those commitments, it would be useless as a trustless money. </p><p>Those properties of commitment, publishing, and verification are valuable far beyond the use case of money. The movement of money is by no means the only type of information that can gain value from a cryptographic and thermodynamic commitment to when it was created (or the earliest point it existed) and when its existence was publicized to the world. Jpegs have shown people value this for even pointlessly stupid arbitrary information, but there is information immensely more valuable than jpegs in this world. </p><h2>Density of Information</h2><p>You have to pay for blockspace when you transact on Bitcoin, and that blockspace is priced in bytes. For every byte of space you take up in that block you have to compete with every other person trying to use that blockspace to pay the going market rate, and anyone can always just pay more and push that rate higher. This gives denser information a competitive advantage in trying to get included in a block. If the density of information is very high, i.e. how many bytes of space you need is very small, you can use that blockspace while paying a lower fee in absolute terms than someone with less dense information. </p><p>The use of blockspace to transfer economic value is one of the densest forms of information that can be included in a block. This will always be the case, and despite all of the drama and rabble rousing about Bitcoin turning into Ethereum, this will ensure Bitcoin’s primary use case remains the transfer of economic value. It is simply the most competitive use of the system in terms of information density. </p><p>However, this does not mean that it will be the only use of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin truly does succeed, the reality is the current market frenzy and activity surrounding Ordinals and Inscriptions will die off. It will not be cost effective to engage in such activities as the cost of blockspace for lower net worth individuals, and as fees rise that dynamic will compound until the use-case is either priced out entirely or reserved to only immensely wealthy individuals. Maybe one day nation states will inscribe images or data to commemorate important historical events, but middle class degenerate gamblers won’t be inscribing jpegs like trading cards in the future. </p><p>They will have to either stop playing those games, or take their games somewhere else. </p><h2>There Is No Blocksize Limit</h2><p>Merkle trees are magical. They can be literally infinitely large, and all you need to prove that a piece of data is part of one is the root hash, and the other hashes in the interior of the tree all the way to the actual piece of data. Cryptographic magic. The only reason the size of merkle trees in a Bitcoin block are limited in size is because users need to validate the contents of the entire block to ensure every transaction inside it is valid. Verifiability of the commitments in a block are integral to Bitcoin’s functioning as a system. </p><figure>

                    <p>You can stick a hash inside of an individual Bitcoin transaction, which means because of the magic of merkle trees, <em><strong>there is no such thing as the blocksize limit when it comes to the Bitcoin blockchain committing to data outside of the scope of Bitcoin transactions themselves</strong></em>. The same way that the small blockheader commits to every transaction in a block with a single hash, a Bitcoin transaction itself can commit to a massive merkle tree made up of immense amounts of data. This has literally <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/opentimestamps-has-timestamped-entire-internet-archive-heres-how">been done before with the entire contents of Internet Archive</a>. </p><p>Earlier I said that transferring economic value is <em>one of</em> the densest forms of data that could utilize Bitcoin blockspace. One of, not <em>the</em> densest. That is because of general purpose timestamping. A single transaction, with a single hash embedded in it, can literally timestamp an <em>infinite</em> amount of data in a way that 100% proves it existed when that block was mined. It is impossible for any use case of blockspace to be denser in informational terms than this. </p><p>Because everything in this merkle tree a transaction commits to has nothing to do with Bitcoin transactions, or whether or not they are valid, it can completely ignore the Bitcoin blocksize limit. On the other hand, it also cannot depend on the Bitcoin network to actually propagate the published information itself, but that is not a critical problem in the digital age. </p><h2>Using The Trees</h2><p>Satoshi himself in the recently released emails with Martii Malmi <a href="https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/status/1761040097481208185?s=20">discussed the use of Bitcoin as a general purpose timestamping tool</a>. This is something many people have done for as long as Bitcoin existed. Old projects like Wall of Eternity would let you pay to stamp messages into the blockchain. People have announced weddings, the birth of children, as well as other much more childish things using OP_RETURN on the blockchain for over a decade. This combines both the commitment and publication functions into a single action, but one that is incredibly inefficient in its use of blockspace. </p><h3>Opentimestamps</h3><p><a href="https://opentimestamps.org/">Opentimestamps</a> (OTS) is the perfect example of a scalable mechanism to facilitate at least the commitment aspect of timestamping. The publication of the data (as well as its commitment in the form of a merkle proof) is left entirely on the user timestamping the information, but the actual timestamping commitment is handled by the OTS Calendar Server. As users submit documents or files to the server, it bundles them up into an unordered merkle tree. It continues aggregating all the hash commitments of individual users files into a single tree until it conducts a periodic on-chain Bitcoin transaction which includes the current root hash of the entire tree it is building. </p><p>As evidenced by the demonstration cited above, this can have <em>immense</em> value as a utility. Now that the entirety of the Internet Archive as of 2017 is timestamped using OTS, it is thermodynamically impossible to alter the contents of anything contained in that archive in a way that could not be detected. Centralized information stores such as the Internet Archive have historically functioned as what amounts to an oracle. They duplicate and copy the state of different pages or information and we trust them not to lie when they say “this is what that information looked like at this date.” </p><p>With a proper Opentimestamps integration, they would never be a trusted entity in that way ever again. They would simply be a host that stores the information itself alongside an OTS merkle proof, and that itself would prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the information they are showing you existed in that form at roughly the time they claimed it did. The historical state of arbitrary information secured thermodynamically by Bitcoin. </p><h3>Mainstay</h3><p>Anyone even remotely familiar with timestamping knows that OTS has one major problem: I can timestamp as many different conflicting things as I want to, and only show you one of them after the fact. For many use cases that boil down to needing to prove a piece of data existed at a certain time, this is a detail that doesn’t matter, but for others it does. </p><p>If I needed to prove that a piece of data was signed off by someone, say a corporate document signed by an executive’s private key, it doesn’t matter if he signed other (even conflicting) things with that key at the same time. All I’m trying to do is prove he signed one specific thing. OTS works fine for that. But imagine a situation where someone wants to attest to a file and prove that “officially” they have attested to only that file and not any others. </p><p>Mainstay is a variation of Opentimestamps that addresses this problem. Rather than a completely unordered merkle tree, it’s very specifically organized in such a way that every user has a specific “slot” in the tree where they can commit to data. Now while this doesn’t prevent people from commiting to other conflicting data in general, when using a Mainstay tree they can publicly use an identifiable slot as their “official” commitment. Anyone verifying such commitments can then ignore or not treat as legitimate any commitment with a merkle proof located in any other part of the tree. </p><h3>Para-Consensus Systems</h3><p>The basic concept of Mainstay can be extended even further to create para-consensus systems piggybacking on top of Bitcoin, Stacks is probably the best known example. By committing the merkle root of arbitrary data in an ordered/identifiable way, and by publishing that information out of band somewhere else so it can be verified against arbitrary rules, a whole new consensus system can be built by anchoring itself into Bitcoin’s blockchain. </p><p>Bitcoin itself doesn’t need to be aware of this in any way. Because of that fact, information that is consensus invalid to the para-consensus system can be committed to by Bitcoin and published out of band, but participants in that para-consensus system can simply ignore it and wait for the next commitment to valid data in their system. This can allow informational density of other economic assets to match that of arbitrary data timestamps. </p><p>This might not be desirable, but it is unstoppable. </p><h3>Other Uses</h3><p>While tokens like Stacks are rather pointless uses of extending Bitcoin’s thermodynamic commitments in my opinion, some ‘assets’ that are not strictly monetary do actually have very sound use cases that could benefit from timestamping. Domain Names and namespaces in general are one. The entire way you interact with the web is steered by DNS, a centralized and trusted system. When you type in <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> a hierarchy of servers is telling your computer what actual IP address to connect to. Those servers can arbitrarily redirect you anywhere, they can deny people access to a domain, they can revoke domains, they have total control over those “directions” everyone’s computer listens to. </p><p>An open and decentralized DNS system piggybacking on top of Bitcoin can address those issues. Rather than an authority granting access to a domain, any person can independently register and commit to a “name” tied to a cryptographic key themselves. Software can find published commitments to such data, and on a basis of trusting the first entries to be the “owner” of a domain, acquire directions to the correct server to connect to from a system that is open, decentralized, and cryptographically verifiable without a centralized authority. </p><h2>A Map of Space and Time</h2><p>Everyone fixates on the use of Bitcoin as money, and rightly so, it is the primary and core functionality of the protocol and network. The economic incentives its use as money creates are the core of what keeps it secure and functioning, it could not exist without that aspect of itself. It would collapse and fail without it. </p><p>But Bitcoin is so much more than <em>just</em> that money system. It is a distributed timestamping system with a decentralized network for publishing everything the system commits to. It is a thermodynamically guaranteed map of digital data in space and time. One that is <em><strong>infinitely</strong></em> extendable. The blocksize limit governs the maximum size of Bitcoin transactions that can be committed to in a single bundle at a time, but it has absolutely no power to restrict any other type of data that the blockchain can commit to. </p><p>Bitcoin is a thermodynamically driven blackhole in a digital era, and it will gobble up every byte of information into its merkle trees that in any way can benefit from the cryptographic guarantees that it can provide. Bitcoin is not just money, and no matter how many times people chant it is only money and nothing else, it will never be true. </p><p>Bitcoin is a digital monster, and it will eat everything. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk2NzM3MDkzNDI5MjA0/default_an_infinite_glowing_digital_merkle_tree_growing_so_hig_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk2NzM3MDkzNDI5MjA0/default_an_infinite_glowing_digital_merkle_tree_growing_so_hig_1.jpg"><media:title>default_an_infinite_glowing_digital_merkle_tree_growing_so_hig_1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk2NzIxMjU1NzM3MzAw/merkle1.png"><media:title>merkle1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk2NzI5MDQwMzY1NTI0/merkle3.png"><media:title>merkle3</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1Mjk2NzMzMDY2ODk2ODk0/merkle4.png"><media:title>merkle4</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin: The Entropy Engine]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin as a system is inherently secured by and built around the concept of entropy, increasing randomness.

When mankind gives something a name, we mark it with a label that helps us discuss our shared environment and experience. At the same time, a label can obscure something in preconceived notions. Labels can make it more difficult for us collectively to understand what something is. </p><p> In 2008, a pseudonymous inventor named Satoshi Nakamoto released a white paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”<sup>1</sup>. The paper outlines a novel distributed network system, called Bitcoin, that acts as an immutable digital ledger. There are many ways to describe what the fundamental innovation here really was. For the context of this article, perhaps it is best to describe the innovation as the creation of a computer system that controls a database, which can only be added to or modified depending on the quantity of physical energy (in the form of electricity) supplied to it. Unlike standard computer systems, where linguistic logic coded by a programmer dictates the state of 0s and 1s, this machine changes when it is fed energy from the Earth. </p><p> Integrating physical energy into the operations of the computer network was a pivotal moment for the possibility of creating digitally native money. Nick Szabo, in his work “Shelling Out: The Origins of Money,” provides an anthropological interpretation of how the use of money developed<sup>2</sup>. In trade, two potentially untrusting parties must find a way to trust one another. To do so, we can rely upon tokens of record that are governed by the laws of nature, which we all can trust. A commodity can be a helpful medium of exchange when it is scarce and hard to reproduce to the degree that people understand the extreme amount of energy and effort it would take to counterfeit one. Scarcity is how homo-sapiens detect the energy required to obtain a given object, giving it trust and validity as a unit of record. The greater the energy, the more desired and valuable it is in our endeavors to cooperate and trust one another. From this point of view, Bitcoin fits this description perfectly, it requires energy to produce and therefore is an immutable record that can be used as powerful money. </p><p> However, as this distributed system evolves, it has become evident that the Bitcoin network does more than simply produce a digital, yet scarce, asset called bitcoin that can be used as money. For this reason, it may be helpful to momentarily give Bitcoin another name to reanalyze the broader function of this machine. For now, let us call it an entropy engine instead. </p><h2>Entropy</h2><p> Entropy is a complicated word that can be articulated in many ways. To begin, consider the equation:</p><blockquote><p>S = kB x lnΩ</p></blockquote><p> S, meaning entropy, equals Boltzmann constant (k) times the natural log of the number of particles (Ω) contained within a system<sup>3</sup>. Entropy can be described as the quantity of available states a system can have. If there is a big container with many molecules, it will have many more possible configurations than a smaller container with fewer molecules. The more particles the container has, the more variations there are in how the molecules can be arranged. According to the second law of thermodynamics, total entropy in an isolated system cannot decrease, but can only increase. Therefore, because entropy always increases, all the molecules eventually find the most likely arrangement, which is them all being spread out equally. This is known as thermodynamic equilibrium, and the universe tends towards this. The continuous increase in entropy is a law of nature. </p><p> Due to entropy’s relationship with possible states, it is also related to randomness. Additionally, it is associated with heat loss. The second law of thermodynamics indicates that when one kind of energy is converted to another type of energy, there will inevitably be some heat loss. The conversion is never 100% efficient. Rub your hands together very quickly, and you will notice that the friction creates heat. This is you contributing to the increase in entropy of the universe. </p><p>This new computer system is an entropy engine because it produces both randomness and heat. To add new transactions to the blockchain, a computer running the software must make many guesses until it finds a hash value with a certain number of leading zeroes. The quicker the machine can produce more random guesses, the more likely the machine is to be rewarded with bitcoin. The more randomness the machine can create, the better it functions and the more heat it produces. This machine involves all things entropy.</p><p> The users of the machine also benefit from the entropy machine more if they can harness more entropy. The mathematics of entropy is foundational to the science of cryptography. Another way of interpreting the equation above, in terms of informational entropy, is that the more particles in a container represent the amount of information needed to understand the state of the system<sup>3</sup>. Put another way, the more possible states and complexity a system has, the more information one would need to gain an understanding of it. Consequently, more entropy represents more inherent uncertainty or surprise an event might have<sup>3</sup>. The entropy engine relies upon public-private key cryptography. A system user will have a public key where they receive bitcoin. At the same time, only they can send their bitcoin because they have the private key, which cannot be derived from the public key. The safe ownership of bitcoin relies upon an individual keeping their private key secret. Cryptographic schemes rely upon the assumption of highly random private keys<sup>3</sup>. In other words, the more randomness used to form a private key, the more secure one can protect their property on the network. Both the maintainers and users of the network utilize entropy for their benefit. </p><h2>Life is in Pursuit of Entropy</h2><p> Not only is this system an entropy engine from a technical point of view, but it can also be viewed as a driver of entropy from a societal point of view. The flow of human civilization can be reconciled with the observation that biological life facilitates the increase of entropy. Imagine a bathtub drain: once the drain plug is pulled, the water within the tub wants to flow down into the drain. Think of this as the universe’s tendency towards higher entropy. An orderly and sustained vortex will form at the drain to facilitate this transition expediently. Order develops to absorb and dissipate the energy, speeding up the process of generating more entropy more efficiently. Order, life, and all the complexity on Earth form to expedite the increase of entropy further as the sun transfers energy to the Earth. Plants grow to absorb sunlight and store the energy within themselves, and animals eat those plants to process the energy further, etc. Now consider the tell-tale sign of someone alive: their body is warm. Our body processes energy and dissipates some continuously as heat. Life forms in pursuit of entropy.</p><p>Our society moves forward when we learn to find more efficient ways to harness and dissipate energy on Earth. A classic discovery we take pride in was our ability to release the energy stored in wood into fire, producing heat. We then learned to release stored energy within coal and then oil; eventually, we harnessed energy from wind and sunlight and finally upgraded to releasing the energy of atoms themselves. We absorb energy (in the form of wood, coal, oil, sunlight, wind, etc.) only to dissipate it for our gain. In the meantime, our society prospers and experiences excellent technological leaps forward as we learn to harness more advanced forms of energy. As we use the energy, heat loss occurs, and entropy increases. We act as the vortex: order that expedites the process. </p><p> Humanity’s fundamental drive is to find and release pockets of stored energy. Interestingly, the entropy engine seems to provide an extra nudge, pushing humanity in this direction to a greater degree. Consider an undeveloped village with no electric infrastructure but near a river where a dam could be built. An ambitious entrepreneur may be interested in making a dam, but the capital expense is high. Additionally, it is not as if the nearby village will immediately purchase all modern electrical luxuries once the dam is built. At most, perhaps each home will gladly buy a lightbulb so their child can study school work after sundown. Though life-changing for the community, the revenue from one lightbulb a night per home is not enough to justify the capital expenditure of the dam. Before the invention of an entropy engine, many areas of the world would be without electricity for similar kinds of reasons. Now, an entropy engine operator is willing to purchase all unused electricity from the dam because cheap electricity leads to profit. The new customer provides a constant and complete excess inventory purchase of electricity for the dam. Suddenly, building a dam becomes economically viable. Before Satoshi’s invention, there were energy sources on Earth that humans did not yet have the financial means to harness. Suddenly, the pockets of energy become viable by inventing an entropy engine, and our harnessing of them multiplies. </p><p> Not only does the business model of an entropy engine operator make previously unaffordable energy infrastructure affordable, but it also helps incentivize the development of renewable energy over the usage of less desirable fossil fuels. Energy grids require flexibility due to the electricity demand. The supply of electrons sent to a city needs to equal the demand for electricity at that time. Of course, a city’s demand for electricity will fluctuate throughout the day and year. An electrical grid needs to be able to dial up and down energy production in response. Currently, there are not enough batteries to store energy when it is not required. This challenges the development of renewable energy infrastructure, especially wind and solar, because nature decides when energy is produced, irrespective of the city’s electrical needs. If energy is not used, it is curtailed and wasted. If not enough is being produced, the city is without power. One reason fossil fuels are so helpful for grid stabilization is that production can be easily changed immediately depending on electricity demand. Of course, this problem could be mitigated if enough renewables were developed that could constantly produce more energy than peak demand. However, this would leave the energy providers without a customer for their excess electricity most of the time, making it financially unviable. Entropy engine operators can then incentivize renewable energy development by acting as a flexible load response that provides shock-absorbing services while increasing profitability in exchange for cheap electrical costs during times of excess supply<sup>4</sup>. Whatever electricity is not sent to the city is purchased by the entropy engine operators, making the capital investment in renewable infrastructure more economically viable. The same goes for nuclear energy, as these systems also struggle to conduct demand response on their own<sup>4</sup>. Therefore, research has shown that entropy engine operators provide additional revenue sources to incentivize renewable energy production and a greener grid<sup>4,5</sup>. </p><h2>Entropy: The Cause of War, and Now Peace</h2><p>Human civilization’s relationship with entropy and the entropy engine does not simply confine itself to how we are driven to harness, release, and use energy from a societal standpoint. It can also be looked at from a socio-political point of view. In a thesis titled <em>Softwar: A Novel Theory of Power Projection and the National Strategic Significance of Bitcoin</em> by Major Jason P. Lowery of the United States Space Force, a description of how energy organizes around the laws of entropy is used to explain the pattern of human behavior around warfare<sup>6</sup>. Power projection theory describes how life formed, per the second law of thermodynamics, by using energy (referred to as power) to sequester other energy (referred to as resources) away from the environment to be used for more personal gain. It is another way of describing how order was formed to facilitate the increase in entropy. This can be observed not only in the first prokaryotic cells that formed in the hydrothermal vents that exist in the fissures of the seafloor but also in the way animals behave in the wild. Major Lowry uses the illustration of wolves snarling their fangs at a would-be thief of their recently acquired game to broadcast that the cost of stealing the resources would be higher than the benefit gained from the food. Here, the wolf is projecting power to keep its resources. Following such reasoning, pack animals such as wolves must create power hierarchies within their communities so that the most powerful wolf, most capable of efficient power projection, is fed and allowed to reproduce so that the pack can have the most power projection capabilities possible to protect their resources. To do so, wolves must physically fight amongst themselves in a competition of dominance. This is an unfortunate requirement, as two wolves will fight until one wolf has their fangs on the jugular of the other to prove superiority<sup>6</sup>. Therefore, the physicality required to create power hierarchies can prove dangerous and fratricidal. Other animals, such as deer, solve this issue with the development of antlers which allows them to use their antlers as power projection weapons against other species but leads to safe competition within their species as the antlers simply tangle as they butt heads without the risk of mortal wounds. In this way, the deer developed a biological method of managing internal power hierarchies using physical power with a decreased risk of fratricide. </p><p>Major Lowry puts forth the idea that human beings, through language and storytelling, developed a form of abstract power projection in an attempt to organize resources without physical violence<sup>6</sup>. However, the universe tends toward increasing entropy, and physical energy is used to manage resource energy. Nature does not recognize the management of resources through any other means aside from physical energy. Therefore, human beings are stuck in a problematic cycle where we attempt to organize our societies and resources through abstract power projection, only to have them collapse under the weight of their hollow foundation through physical power projection. To our understandable discontent and frustration, war, civil war, and revolutions are constantly occurring as nature’s only proper mechanism of organizing resources. Though a bleak outlook on how humans must manage themselves, Major Lowry provides hope that the technological innovation of an entropy engine solves this crucial flaw in how our societies organize. The entropy engine is a means of managing resources using physical power. In other words, it acts as a technological antler allowing human beings to organize themselves following the laws of nature without the need for kinetic violence and fratricide. Rather than mutually assured destruction through nuclear warfare, the entropy engine promotes mutually assured protection as we all use the machine to protect our resources and each other simultaneously.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The operation of this distributed entropy engine relies upon the competitive production of entropy. Its users can secure their property most when using machines that produce the most entropy. It economically incentivizes, subsidizes, and makes possible the harnessing of previously untapped energy resources of the Earth. It also potentially reduces our need to fight wars in pursuit of resource acquisition because it allows us to compete over resources via other, more peaceful means. This entropy engine, Bitcoin, is accelerating human beings in fulfilling their cosmic purpose of facilitating energy flow in the universe. All while making society more resource-abundant, peaceful, and cooperative. If the second law of thermodynamics is inevitable, what does that make Bitcoin?</p><h3>References</h3><blockquote><p>1.

On March 16, 2024, hundreds of women from diverse backgrounds ranging from students and entrepreneurs to professionals and homemakers, united by a shared desire to learn and grow in the digital age, gathered and participated in a series of educational initiatives aimed at empowering women by demystifying Bitcoin and decentralized digital finance technologies. Each session provided attendees with invaluable insights from top tier female experts in different fields of life. Tochi Onyia, Ure Utah, and Ifeoluwa Adegoke opened the attendees’ mindset to the unending opportunities awaiting them in finance and open source technology world, using their personal career journey as point of contact for young women towards exploring the intricacies of Bitcoin as a technology and its potential to transform their financial futures. </p><figure>

                    <h2>Breaking Barriers</h2><p>Despite the regulatory challenges surrounding the Blockchain and Digital financial system in Nigeria, the organizers remained undeterred in their mission to empower women. By equipping them with knowledge and skills in Bitcoin, Open Source Tech and Business Analysis, they sought to break down barriers to financial inclusion and create opportunities for economic empowerment. The event hosted by the convener of Women In Bitcoin Club, sponsored by digital financial technology focused firms, Noones, DigiOats, BloccAfricaAfrica creative media and other indigenous P2P channels such as NickXchange proved to be a significant milestone in promoting financial inclusion and gender equality in Nigeria’s digital economy space. These leading proponents of decentralized technology and financial innovation, showcased their unwavering commitment to driving positive change and fostering a culture of inclusion and empowerment. Their participation was instrumental in making the event a resounding success and reaching a wider audience of women across Nigeria.</p><figure>

                    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2><p>As Nigeria Bitcoiners reflect on the success of this groundbreaking initiative, they remain steadfast in their commitment to advancing financial literacy and promoting equal access to economic opportunities for women. With continued support from stakeholders, and a favorable regulatory landscape, they are poised to expand their reach and make an even greater impact in the months and years to come. In a time of uncertainty and upheaval, these have demonstrated resilience and resolve in educators efforts to empower women through education and technology. As the world celebrates International Women’s Day, let’s draw inspiration from their example and continue to work towards a future where all women have the knowledge, resources, and opportunities to thrive in the digital economy, specifically in Africa and the global south at scale.</p><figure>

This is a question that I have thought about recently, and I wanted to think through what happens to governments on a Bitcoin standard. The questions I have are the following: how will governments fund themselves? How do your taxes work in a digital landscape, and how will governments respond to this dilemma?</p><h3>How Will Governments Fund Themselves?</h3><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MjcwMDM0MjA4MDA3NDEw/image1.jpg" height="800" width="1067">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Most hardcore Bitcoiners probably could care less about what happens to the government on a Bitcoin standard. I would venture to say that they would want all governments to crash and burn. I sympathize with that point of view, but I am also a realist. The average person wants the government around because they have been conditioned to believe it brings a sense of order and protects its citizens. I think it is the opposite, but this isn’t a majority view.</p><p>Governments of different sizes and configurations have existed for thousands of years and will likely still be around when hyperbitcoinization is realized. So how will governments fund themselves when the power to create money on a whim has been irrevocably taken away from them?</p><p>In the West, governments primarily tax income as a major source of revenue because they have the ability to surveil most transactions through payment rails controlled by the Federal Reserve, banks, and through the threat of force and imprisonment. This has worked for them for a long time, but this will no longer be possible on a Bitcoin standard.</p><p>The very nature of Bitcoin makes the tracking of the income of every economic participant virtually impossible and very time-intensive, especially when privacy tools such as coinjoins and lightning are thrown into the mix. You can start to understand why governments don’t like Bitcoin, it takes away their power.</p><p>Without the power to wantonly tax individuals, governments will be forced to develop methods to generate revenue to sustain themselves. More on that later.</p><h3>The Bitcoin Economy Of The Future</h3><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MjcwMDM0NDc2NDQyNzM3/image3.jpg" height="800" width="1067">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Imagine a future where everyone buys and sells goods peer to peer using Bitcoin. This, by default, would be a tax-free economy. Currently, there is no line of code in the Bitcoin protocol that can calculate sales tax when you buy goods, and no Bitcoiner would even consider creating something like that unless they want to be tarred and feathered as simp for the government.</p><p>I don’t even know if that is technically possible to do, to be honest. Nobody likes paying taxes and wouldn’t shed a tear over not having to pay them anymore. This creates another dilemma for governments around the world. If they can’t tax income and they can’t effectively tax consumption, what alternatives do they have to sustain themselves?</p><p>There is no simple answer to this. I think our whole concept of what government is and how it relates to its people will have to radically shift from a top-down concept to a more decentralized customer service model. This is more in line with the libertarian worldview of what the state should look like, where governments are voluntarily funded by their citizens instead of being compelled to fund it through the barrel of a gun.</p><p>Under this model, governments will have to be much smaller than they are today as they would have to be mindful of revenues versus outlays, just like any business would. If the governments are good fiscal stewards of their Bitcoin treasuries, citizens will be far more likely to reward governments with continued support. This form of a signal of support has more influence than voting. The ability to withhold funding will make politicians more responsive to the people.</p><p>Elections could still be held as this wouldn’t have to change. Political parties would have to show they are good stewards of capital, or the government wouldn’t get voluntarily funded and would naturally fall from power in the next election. This is a world that I think we should be working towards, as it will make the world a safer place for everyone.</p><h3>How Will Governments Respond To This Emerging Challenge?</h3><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MjcwMDM0MjA4NDY2MDMz/image2.jpg" height="800" width="1199">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>While this might sound like music to our ears, politicians hate the idea of Bitcoin or having to be responsive to the citizenry. They have it pretty good right now as it is. They get to tell people what to do, get good benefits, and get reelected even if they break their promises—no wonder they never want to leave office.</p><p>In America, incumbents get reelected north of 90 percent.<a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/10/incumbent-politicians-enjoy-record-reelection-in-aging-congress/"> Did you know in the House of Representatives, the reelection of incumbents has never dipped below 85 percent?</a> So you only have 15 percent of being voted out in the next election. Who doesn’t like those odds? This is why nothing changes. We get the same people in office year after year because they know how to play the game and grease the right palms, all thanks to the fiat money printer.</p><p>If you want to see all the BS the federal government spends on their deprecating fiat dollar, check out the<a href="https://www.cagw.org/"> Citizens Against Government Waste</a> website. This will give you a good idea of the crap that is being funded in your name.</p><p>So, knowing this, do you think they will willingly give up all this power, prestige, and influence? I don’t think so. They will employ various tricks to either capture Bitcoin for their benefit or make it so cumbersome that people won’t use it.</p><p>I fear that Bitcoiners have already fallen into one of their traps with the Bitcoin ETF. I sincerely believe this was a wrong move and can tremendously slow down the adoption of Bitcoin in the US. Sorry to say, but most people want quick and easy regarding anything in life, even Bitcoin.</p><p>Answer this question: Why would those with very little knowledge of Bitcoin learn the ins and outs of self-custody, and why is it important when they can “own” Bitcoin in their retirement account? 9 out of 10 people are going to choose this option. As long as they see their retirement portfolio rise because of Bitcoin, they will gladly oblige to having large custodians like Blackrock hold their Bitcoin, not understanding how dangerous third-party custody really is to Bitcoin.</p><p>At least we have a chance with Bitcoin to improve the world. Let's hope people take the opportunity to achieve real freedom. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

However, the question of whether to segregate the activities of operating an exchange and a custodian is more nuanced. Large banks often run their trading businesses and their custody businesses in the same legal entity, using information walls to control for conflicts of interest and ensuring that their own assets are segregated from those of their clients. This paper will use the experience of the US grain industry in the late nineteenth century to illustrate the importance of controlling the risks between custody and execution activities. </p><h2>Cryptoasset Custody</h2><p>Cryptoasset custody is a complex undertaking involving, among other things, managing information security risk to protect private keys and keep transactions secure. Custodians also act as a form of payment service provider, receiving cryptoassets and sending them based on the instructions of their clients. </p><p>Many of the early cryptoasset exchanges bundled custody with execution for their largely retail client base and some continue to do so. When they first launched, the exchanges had to build the capability to safeguard their own assets. Extending this capability to their largely retail client base for free created much stickier client relationships and was an oblique way of monetising the sunk cost of their in-house custody arrangements. </p><p>Since FTX’s failure there have been both private sector and public sector efforts to change this model. The private sector has seen wider adoption of ‘Off Exchange Settlement’ (OES) by the large exchanges, often in response to the demand of institutional clients. OES seeks to mitigate counterparty risks by removing the need for clients to keep their cryptoassets at exchanges. This, incidentally, is how Zodia Markets was designed from inception. In the public sphere, there have been regulatory measures such as those by the SEC calling for Investment Advisors to only use Qualified Custodians for their clients’ cryptoassets. There have also been consultations such as the one by HM Treasury in the UK, which signalled support for the segregation of client assets from those of the exchanges those clients use. </p><h2>Cryptoasset Exchanges</h2><p>Cryptoasset exchanges and traditional exchanges had similar origins insofar as most began as informal venues for retail customers. On the cryptoasset side, Coinbase started as a private service to buy and sell Bitcoin through bank transfer, while Mt. Gox started as a trading service for card collectors. In the traditional world, the LSE started out as a private association of traders based in John’s Coffee House in the City of London, while in medieval Belgium traders convened at the Huis ter Beurze, a tavern, which gave its name to the term ‘bourse’, as in Deutsche Börse. Taking a broader perspective, exchanges are designed to fulfill five functions:</p><ol><li>Standardization, such as through weights and measures or consistently designed trading contracts,</li><li>Protection of property rights, such as through rule books,</li><li>Enforcement of contractual agreements through sanctions for bad actors, </li><li>Mitigation of information asymmetries by disseminating information, often through a transparent order book and </li><li>Providing public goods by ensuring rules are adhered to. </li></ol><p>Judicial and legislative sanctioning of these rules by the state tended to follow, rather than the other way round. </p><h2>Omnibus and Segregated: Elevators and Sacks</h2><p>The development of grain exchanges in the late nineteenth century United States, particularly the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), helps illustrate the tension between custodians on the one hand and exchanges on the other. During the late 1840s and early 1850s, the quantity of grain shipped to Chicago grew dramatically as the United States expanded west. Storage elevators operated by warehousemen were large, specialized warehouses where grain was kept in bins before shipment. In a sense they are equivalent to omnibus cryptoasset custodians where the assets of various owners are commingled in a single wallet.</p><p>The CBOT started out as a sleepy organisation, even having to encourage attendance at its meetings in the 1850s by providing free meals. The exchange grew to play a role in standardizing the grading, inspection and weighing of commodities, including grain, which is function 1 in the list above. The warehousemen who operated the elevators were at odds with the traders and shippers of the grain, who were more aligned with the exchange. </p><p>The storage of cryptoassets involves, among other things, the indexing of the chains and asset screening. Blockchain indexing eases the process of finding information stored in the blockchain rather than analyzing data block-by-block. It does this by parsing and storing the data in a centralized database where it can then be queried. Indexing is a form of confirming the on-chain property rights of the custodian’s client. This is function 2. Certainly, clients could do this themselves, but it is much easier to pay a custodian to do it on their behalf. </p><p>Screening and scoring are a financial crime monitoring measure that has no real equivalent in traditional finance, since it is specific to blockchains. Private firms provide scoring services to assess the financial crime exposure of a particular asset or wallet. If an asset or wallet has recently interacted with an address that is known to be associated with criminal activity, then the score is adversely impacted. This means that the notion that cryptoassets are perfectly fungible is not strictly accurate. Different wallets and assets have different scores. Where custodians operate omnibus wallets, so this affects the score of the overall holdings by commingling assets of different scores.</p><p>The same was true of grain in that it is not nearly as fungible as one might imagine. There are different grades depending on the growing area, such as Russian Rye wheat, River Plate wheat, East India wheat and so on. Other grading criteria included, for example, moisture content, foreign matter, and damaged grains. </p><p>The challenge in the United States was the scale and sophistication of the custodial infrastructure that collected grain into elevators before being transported. This was different from countries like Argentina where the infrastructure was less sophisticated, and grain was parceled into sacks for shipping. </p><p>Custodians that operate separate wallets for each of their clients are analogous to the grain sacks of Argentina. Omnibus grain elevators created economies of scale through quantity and scale. However, this came with the trade-off of making it harder to track quality compared with using grain sacks that could be tagged with a particular grade from the point of packing to arrival at the end customer. In cryptoassets omnibus wallets also create economies of scale, such as reducing on-chain transaction costs, but the scoring of individual sets of assets becomes more challenging if not impossible.</p><h2>The Risks of Comingling and Custodians trading on own account</h2><p>The commingling of grain allowed the warehousemen to engage in unscrupulous practices. For example, they could receive a shipment of grade one grain and then mix it with grade two to the point that it was still just within the acceptable range for a one grade. As a result, the warehouse was able to improve the quality of grain on its own account to the detriment of others. This of course resulted in a dead weight loss for those who had high-quality grain stored at the elevator. This discouraged farmers from ensuring their grain was of the highest quality. Further down the supply chain, shippers engaged in mixing to be as close to the threshold between grades, so the loss to the warehousemen would be minimized. In some senses there is a Gresham’s Law at work, with poor-quality grain driving out good quality grain. In summary, standardization and the protection of property, functions 1 and 2, became flawed.</p><p>One key difference between cryptoassets and the grain markets is that the grading and scoring of cryptoassets is conducted by third party private sector companies, since the data is public and anyone can do it. However, omnibus wallets do limit this capability since a great deal of trading activity can take place off-chain and then net settle to the omnibus wallet. </p><p>Another source of tension revolved around function 4. Warehousemen, who could trade on the exchange but also traded off the exchange in private transactions, had information about supply and demand as well as the qualities of grain in storage, thus creating a conflict of interest. While this information was their property and the treatment of information as property does act as an incentive to owners to produce and sell that information, there is a counterargument that mandatory disclosure can help prevent insider trading, market abuse and adverse selection. </p><p>What is key is where the warehousemen were able to commingle their own assets with those of their clients and where they were able to trade on their own account, they had the temptation to engage in abusive and illicit practices, which put them into conflict with the CBOT. It is no surprise that the responses to HMT’s consultation calling for firm and client assets to be segregated were overwhelming. </p><p>The CBOT had a long-running conflict with the warehousemen as it struggled to apply the same standardization of weights, measures, and grades as it had in other assets such as lumber. In 1906 the CBOT implemented the Call Rule that required that any private trades concluded off the exchange had to be at the closing price for the day. The warehousemen were more afraid of expulsion from the exchange than the costs of adhering to this rule so they adhered to it. The rule was also given judicial backing on this important market function. This allowed the CBOT to manage the conflict of interest around the warehousemen being able to trade on their own account, but critically that was not done by banning them from trading. </p><p>All of this meant that the economies of scale of elevators could be retained, while allowing for the conflicts of interest and other issues of tension to be managed. What is readily apparent is that banning elevators or preventing warehousemen from trading was never a realistic option. Technology and the economies of scale that it brought was held to be a fundamental good. Yes, it introduced new risks but over time the market and the regulators were able to manage these novel risks under a model that has operated for over a hundred years. One hopes that the same attitude can be brought to bear in the cryptoasset markets. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Nick Philpott.

<p>“Disrupting the remittance market is a key milestone in our roadmap to provide easy to use Bitcoin-native financial services and has always been a compelling application for the Bitcoin network," said Ben Price, Founder and CEO of The Bitcoin Company." With Bitcoin, payments can be cheap, instant, inclusive, and global."</p><p>By leveraging the Bitcoin network, The Bitcoin Company's Remittance API offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional banking rails like SWIFT, reducing international remittance costs significantly. The API communicates with local payment networks in Mexico (SPEI) and Brazil (Pix), ensuring funds are deposited instantly into recipients' bank accounts.</p><p>The remittance market in Mexico and Brazil has historically relied on costly services like Western Union and MoneyGram, which charge high fees. According to the World Bank, remittance payments to Mexico and Brazil cost 3.01% and 4.59%, respectively, with an average international remittance cost of 6.18%. The Bitcoin Company's API disrupts this landscape by providing low-cost, instant, and 24/7 cross-border payments.</p><p>"Cross-border payments as they exist today are broken," Price continued. "Traditional remittance providers like Western Union are taking advantage of the world’s most desperate populations by charging exorbitantly high fees for sending/receiving money. Cross border payments are now trivial with our new Remittances API that leverages the Bitcoin network. Our plans include expanding to more regions and currencies to service both business and consumer payments. We’re so happy to help enable other developers to turn on low-cost, cross-border, instant payments in their applications with a simple API integration."</p><p>This launch aligns with The Bitcoin Company's vision to provide easy-to-use, Bitcoin-native financial services and build developer-friendly infrastructure connecting Bitcoin with legacy financial systems.

When you take self-custody of your own Bitcoin, you and only you are responsible for the safety of your funds. Self-custody also means that no one can freeze your funds, and no one can stop you from making a payment you want to make. It’s a double-edged sword: there are huge benefits to self-custody, but it also comes with responsibility.</p><p>If you make a mistake and send Bitcoin to the wrong address there is no undoing it. Then if someone can access your seed phrase (seed words), there is no customer support to help you, that person now has access to your money. If you lose your keys and your seed phrase backups, there is no recovery process to get your wallet back. It’s very much like cash in that regard: once it’s gone, it’s gone. </p><p>People generally go through life with no existential anxiety over having small amounts of cash but protecting significant amounts of money presents a source of worry, and Bitcoin is no different. </p><h2>Custody and Crypto Wallets</h2><p>When it comes to managing your Bitcoin, there are multiple types of wallets you can use. However, not all of them offer you true ownership of your assets. Here's a breakdown of the types of wallets you will encounter and how they approach self-custody.</p><h3>Custodial Wallets</h3><p>Custodial wallets are generally offered by centralized exchanges, the same platforms that allow you to buy Bitcoin with fiat currency. These wallets work essentially just like a bank account. You do not actually have any control of your money. They can freeze your funds, lock and close your account, and deny you permission to make transactions or withdrawals with your own money. They do offer the potential to transact very cheaply with other users of the same wallet, but at the cost of giving control over your money to the custodian. They should never be used to store any significant amount of money, and any Bitcoin you purchase should be withdrawn to a non-custodial wallet as soon as possible.</p><h3>Non-Custodial Wallets</h3><p>Non-custodial wallets all offer true self-custody: only you have access to your assets. But even wallets that offer self-custody come with a range of trade-offs. They can also serve different purposes.</p><p>Software Wallets, also known as hot wallets, run on your mobile phone or your laptop computer. They do leave control over your funds in your own hands, but they manage and store the private keys on your device. This exposes them to the risk of compromise by hackers. You should only protect small amounts of money with a software wallet, what you reasonably expect to spend in a short time period. </p><p>A hardware wallet is a special device designed to keep your private keys as secure as possible. These devices are what you should use to store the bulk of your Bitcoin. They keep the private key offline and inaccessible to any threat from hackers, and allow signing transactions in a secure environment. A special note when using hardware wallets, the vast majority of them have a screen on the device that is used to display information about where a transaction is being sent before signing. <strong>Always double check the address and amounts shown by your device when signing to make sure the money is being sent to the correct place. </strong></p><h2>How to approach Self-Custody</h2><p>Here are some basic steps you can take to ensure you are interacting with your Bitcoin in a safe and secure manner: </p><h3>Test Your Backups</h3><p>The first thing you have to do when taking custody of your own funds is to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/sponsored/understanding-your-bitcoin-keys-bip39-seed-words">generate your seed words</a>, also known as a seed phrase. This is like the master key to all of the accounts you will create with that wallet.</p><p>When you first complete the wallet setup, your wallet will generate a random number called a seed, or entropy. From there, your wallet will translate this number into 12-24 words called a seed phrase, or seed words.</p><p>Any wallet that is properly designed to encourage user safety should have you verify and prove you wrote down the seed phrase by challenging you on some (or all) of the words in it. If you are managing significant sums of money, it is always safest to double-check. </p><p>To follow, you will need to generate an “account” which will create your wallet’s first receiving address, which looks like this: bc1q653jc5hxawj5lwxgm8tt73qzw6rurmc5d42qd2</p><p>It never hurts to be safe and double-check things. After you’ve finished setting up your wallet, but before you start transacting, you can reset the wallet and re-initialize it. Instead of generating a new seed phrase, you can import the one you just backed up. If the first Bitcoin address is the same, you can be sure you’ve correctly backed up your seed phrase. </p><h3>Send A Test Transaction</h3><p>When it comes to making your first withdrawal from an exchange it can be a bit nerve-wracking. Is this address correct? Did I make a mistake? One of the scariest things for many people about Bitcoin is the digital nature of it. Everyone has in their mind this image from a movie scene where someone teenage hacker compromises a government system to further the plot. Most people don’t understand the first thing about how computers work, but they understand there are numerous ways they can be compromised or hacked. </p><p>I don’t know about you, but when there is a risk I am aware of that could affect me and I don’t understand how that risk exposes itself to me, I get worried. Just like verifying your seed phrase by recovering the backup before using the wallet, you can send coins to your wallet slowly. If someone were to compromise how you generated your wallet in the first place, they would be able to take any money you send to that wallet the instant you send it. </p><p>So just don’t send all of your money at once. Send a small test transaction with a tiny percent of the Bitcoin you intend to take into self-custody. Make sure those funds actually show up in your wallet first. To really be sure, you can even make sure that you can spend those coins by sending them back to the next address in your wallet. </p><p>After making a test transaction and ensuring that you have the keys needed to spend money sent to that wallet, you can deposit the rest of your money to that wallet. After a small test deposit without seeing such a transaction occur that you didn’t initiate, you can have much greater confidence that your wallet was set up securely. </p><h3>NEVER Create Digital Seed Phrase Backups</h3><p>Your seed phrase backup is your money. Whoever has access to your seed has full access to your funds. There is no customer support line to call, there are no chargebacks or insurance coverage for stolen funds in non-custodial Bitcoin wallets. If you mess this up, what’s done is done. </p><p>Hardware wallets that you actually use to sign transactions are specifically designed to hold the private keys your seed generates securely. When you make a backup of your seed phrase it should <strong>strictly</strong> be on something analog; a piece of paper, a steel plate with punched letters, something physical and completely offline. </p><p>You should <strong>NEVER</strong> do something like take a screenshot or picture of your seed phrase on your phone, or keep a backup in a text document or Google Cloud or iCloud. People’s computers and internet service accounts get hacked and compromised on a regular basis at very large scales. </p><p>Only keeping your keys stored on a physical medium like paper, and a secure device like a hardware wallet immensely lowers your risk of your coins being stolen through the compromise of your seed phrase. Your iCloud account can be hacked remotely from anywhere, whereas the seed phrase backup on steel in your safe requires someone to physically break into your safe. </p><h3>Multisig Requires Extra Backups!</h3><p>If you are using a multisig wallet, <em><strong>the seed phrase backups are not enough to recover your funds</strong></em>. The point of multisig is to increase your security by requiring more than one key to sign to spend your money. Typically, they will require a minimum threshold of devices that must sign each transaction. For example, it might require 2 out of 3 signatures. This ensures that someone compromising or you losing a key or two doesn’t result in losing your funds, but it comes with a nuanced catch. You can lose some of the private keys in a multisig, but if you don’t keep <strong>all</strong> of your public keys, you won’t be able to find your Bitcoin on the blockchain to spend in the future. This is due to how multisig wallets create the information necessary to process transactions.</p><p>When you make backups for a multisig wallet, each individual private key backup should also be accompanied by a backup of the public keys (wallets will call this an “xpub”) for all of the wallet addresses involved in the multisig. This ensures that you can find your coins on-chain even if you lose access to one of the accounts.</p><h3>Never Talk About Your Stack</h3><p>Being involved in Bitcoin can be a very exciting experience, especially when the price is going up. This can also be a liability depending on who knows about your Bitcoin holdings. As was mentioned earlier, if someone can gain access to your seed phrase they gain access to your money. Bitcoin has the potential to become <strong>immensely</strong> valuable in the future. </p><p>Owning Bitcoin is not a fact that you should be parading around to the whole world and everyone you know. Obviously, if you are married it will be very difficult to keep a significant sum of Bitcoin secret from your spouse. If you have very close friends, it's something likely to come up or be observed by them over time. </p><p>But you don’t have to go telling everyone you meet that you own Bitcoin. And you shouldn’t. As Bitcoin has increased in value over the years, physical attacks on Bitcoiners in order to steal their money have become more and more common. The more people who know you hold Bitcoin, the greater your exposure to potential risks like that. </p><p><strong><em>Don’t go blabbing your mouth off to everyone you meet about your Bitcoin stack</em>. </strong></p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Bitcoin can be, although it shouldn’t be, an intimidating thing to take possession of. It’s just like cash in a way, if you lose it no one can do anything about it. But in other ways, it's not quite like cash at all. </p><p>People are worried about holding large sums of cash because if you lose it or someone steals it, it’s gone for good. Bitcoin <em>can be backed up</em>. If you lose your Bitcoin, you can literally just magically get it back if you have a backup. That’s because your Bitcoin isn’t in your wallet, your Bitcoin is stored on the blockchain. If you have a copy of your seed phrase you can regain access to all of your BTC no matter which wallet you use.</p><p> You can’t just “back up” physical cash. A xerox copy of cash isn’t cash, and won’t be treated as such by anyone. But a Bitcoin word seed phrase restores your access to your Bitcoin instantly. That should be an <em>alleviation</em> of anxiety when comparing Bitcoin to something like cash. </p><p>Multisig wallets offer an option to defend against theft. When you have a safe full of cash at home, someone can simply break into your house and take all of it. With a multisig Bitcoin wallet, if you only have a single key at home with you a thief cannot take your Bitcoin by breaking in and taking the key you have at home. This is something that cash <em>cannot do</em>. </p><p>Larger amounts of cash are a large incentive for thieves to target you. But if they don’t know you have a large amount of cash, they have no reason to target you. Just don’t tell them about it. Bitcoin isn’t a special variable here. </p><p>Bitcoin can be intimidating to self-custody because of the risks it shares in common with cash, but when you really take the time to learn what tools are available to help you self-custody it, it's not that intimidating. In many ways, it can be safer than cash to hold yourself. </p><p>So stop worrying, have a little patience, and slowly take the time to learn the basic things you can do to protect your stack yourself. After a little while you won’t even think twice about it. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTk5ODAyNjM0MzQ4MTY0/ledger-10-steps--dos-and-donts-of-self-custody---article-preview.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTk5ODAyNjM0MzQ4MTY0/ledger-10-steps--dos-and-donts-of-self-custody---article-preview.png"><media:title>ledger-10-steps--dos-and-donts-of-self-custody---article-preview</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stratum Reference Implementation Launches SRI 1.0.0 To Enhance Bitcoin Mining]]></title><description><![CDATA[SRI 1.0.0 is officially here, bringing significant upgrades in enhancing and decentralizing Bitcoin mining operations.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/stratum-reference-implementation-launches-sri-1-0-0-to-enhance-bitcoin-mining</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/stratum-reference-implementation-launches-sri-1-0-0-to-enhance-bitcoin-mining</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[SRI]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Stratum Reference Implementation]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 22:17:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTgwNzg4ODE0MjU5Mzky/default_bitcoin_mining_0-2.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Stratum Reference Implementation (SRI) team has unveiled SRI 1.0.0, a new milestone in their journey to decentralize and optimize bitcoin mining, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. This latest release is now available for immediate testing and seamless integration.</p><p>Some key highlights of SRI 1.0.0 include:</p><ul><li>Miners can connect to SV2 pools without upgrading existing SV1 firmware through Translation Proxy or directly using an SV2 firmware device like BraiinsOS.</li><li>Miners have the flexibility to run their bitcoin nodes, construct templates, and declare them to the SV2 Pool.</li><li>The implementation of pool fallback functionality ensures continuity in mining activities even if a pool decides to censor transactions, thereby incentivizing pools to prioritize miners' interests.</li></ul><p>This new version is the culmination of enhancements in the Stratum V2 specification achieved through collaboration within the working group and rigorous testing with the interoperability suite to ensure seamless compatibility between implementations of the Stratum V2 protocol.</p><p>The release allows miners using SV1 or SV2 firmware to connect directly to an SV2 Pool or through a translation proxy. Miners can construct their block templates using a locally hosted Job Declaration Client and a patched version of Bitcoin Core Node, enabling them to send their templates to the Job Declarator Server operated by the SV2 Pool. Importantly, this update also allows independent third parties to run the node and JDC, expanding operational capabilities.</p><p>The newly implemented pool fallback feature ensures miners maintain mining activity by automatically switching to alternative pools in the event a pool rejects their templates. This mechanism serves as a strong incentive for pools to act in the miners' best interests, ensuring miners' hash power remains secure and competitive.</p><p>SRI's user-friendly pool setup and upcoming enhancements make it an attractive option for miners and pools seeking streamlined mining experiences. The project says it welcomes contributions and support from individuals and corporate entities interested in providing grants to help accelerate the development, research, and innovation in bitcoin mining technology.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTgwNzg4ODE0MjU5Mzky/default_bitcoin_mining_0-2.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTgwNzg4ODE0MjU5Mzky/default_bitcoin_mining_0-2.jpg"><media:title>default_bitcoin_mining_0-2</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin's Surge to All Time High: What It Means for Your Investment Future]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some factors to consider now that Bitcoin seems to be performing bullishly again so you don't wind up making emotional or bad decisions in the heat of a market frenzy.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoins-surge-to-all-time-high-what-it-means-for-your-investment-future</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoins-surge-to-all-time-high-what-it-means-for-your-investment-future</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[All Time High]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Miles Oliver]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTc4OTcwOTY5MjIwNzQw/default_someone_going_over_their_finances_1.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin, the first and most popular cryptocurrency, has been making headlines with its recent surge to a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-12/bitcoin-btc-hovers-near-record-high-as-crypto-draws-record-inflows?embedded-checkout=true">all-time high of over $72,000</a>. This remarkable price increase has sparked renewed interest in Bitcoin as an investment opportunity, leaving many wondering what this means for their financial future.</p><p>Investors may see this surge as a validation of Bitcoin's potential as a long-term store of value and may allocate more of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies. However, the rapid rise in price may also raise concerns about potential volatility and the sustainability of such gains, prompting investors to carefully evaluate the risks before making investment decisions.</p><h2>Understanding Market Dynamics and Risks</h2><p>While <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/official-bitcoin-reaches-new-all-time-high">Bitcoin has grown significantly</a> over the years due to various factors, including rising institutional adoption, increased investor interest, and greater acceptance by traditional financial organizations, it's still seen as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052014/why-bitcoins-value-so-volatile.asp">highly volatile asset.</a> This level of vulnerability which can be affected by supply and demand, government regulation, and sensationalism, is not exclusive to Bitcoin. It’s also evident in traditional investment avenues.</p><p>Investors should <a href="https://www.stockloansolutions.com/blog/b/5-interesting-facts-you-should-know-about-financial-markets">understand the financial markets</a> and take a well-considered approach to investing. No stock investment is a sure thing, and Bitcoin is no exception. However, with the right strategies, investors can capitalize on Bitcoin's potential for high returns while mitigating the risks associated with this market. </p><h2>Strategies for Incorporating Bitcoin into Wealth Preservation</h2><p>Despite the unpredictability of Bitcoin stock, many are attracted to it since it acts as a hedge against inflation. With traditional currencies, governments can print more money, leading to a loss in purchasing power. However, Bitcoin's finite supply makes it immune to inflation, contrasting with traditional currencies where governments can print more money, leading many to view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.</p><p>Here are some strategies for incorporating Bitcoin into your financial security:</p><h3>Diversify Your Investments</h3><p>Investors should diversify their portfolios and allocate a portion to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This will help mitigate risk and capitalize on Bitcoin's potential high returns. Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tied to a stable asset like the US dollar, can be used as a buffer for Bitcoin's volatility.</p><h3>Take Calculated Risks</h3><p>To safeguard and increase wealth effectively, <a href="https://www.creditonebank.com/articles/why-true-wealth-preservation-requires-necessary-risks">investors must be willing to take calculated risks</a> for sustained growth and long-term profitability. These can include strategic savings, investing in a mix of asset classes, and incorporating Bitcoin into asset protection efforts. They must also be aware of scammers seeking to exploit the growing interest in cryptocurrencies and take measures to safeguard their investments against fraudulent schemes.</p><h3>Educate Yourself</h3><p>Before making any financial decisions, it is important to educate yourself on the market. This is especially true for Bitcoin, given its unique characteristics. Take the time to research the technology behind this cryptocurrency, its market trends, and its potential impact on traditional financial systems. Given its resilience, portability, and divisibility, it's also wise to explore <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-is-ultimate-wealth-preservation">Bitcoin's value</a> compared to gold, stocks, and other conventional investments, to make an educated decision that can help increase your monetary gains. </p><h3>Regulate Your Emotions</h3><p>It's essential to keep emotions in check and stick to a well-considered investment plan. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on market variations or FOMO (fear of missing out). This will help ensure a more rational and stable approach to incorporating Bitcoin into your wealth management strategy. The key is approaching Bitcoin as a long-term investment rather than trying to time the market.</p><h3>Use Dollar-Cost Averaging</h3><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asphttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">Dollar-cost averaging</a> is a tactic where you invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of market fluctuations. This can aid in smoothing out the effects of market instability and potentially reduce vulnerabilities. The beauty of this approach is that it can be applied to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, making it an effective way to incorporate them into your portfolio.</p><h3>Utilize Tax-Loss Harvesting</h3><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxgainlossharvesting.asp">Tax-loss harvesting</a> is a technique where investors sell investments at a loss to compensate for any capital gains, resulting in lower taxes. Given Bitcoin's volatility, this strategy can be advantageous when incorporated into your portfolio. However, be mindful of the IRS guidelines and consult with a tax professional for guidance to prevent any legal issues.</p><h3>Stick to a Long-Term Plan</h3><p>Getting caught up in the hype and making short-term decisions based on Bitcoin's price fluctuations can be appealing. However, to effectively include Bitcoin in your financial portfolio, it's vital to stick to a long-term financial plan. This will help prevent emotional reactions to market changes and allow for a more strategic approach.</p><h2>Future Projections for Bitcoin</h2><p>Many experts believe <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-price-prediction-2024/">Bitcoin's surge</a> to over $72,000 is just the beginning of its potential growth. One projection by the CEO of Ark Invest estimates a future price range of over $1 million per Bitcoin by 2030. While no one can predict the exact trend of Bitcoin's value, it's clear that this cryptocurrency has established itself as a viable and valuable asset class.</p><p>Bitcoin's recent surge further solidifies its position as a legitimate investment option. With growing institutional acceptance and continued interest from investors, it's likely to see even more significant growth in the future. Understanding the risks and having a well-considered approach to incorporating Bitcoin into wealth preservation efforts can help investors capitalize on this potential.</p><p>As with any investment, thorough research and careful consideration are crucial to making informed decisions and maximizing returns. Monitor Bitcoin's future developments and consider including it in your investment strategy for long-term financial growth and stability. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Miles O.

Dubbed "crypto winter," the unforgiving market crushed the hopes of many traders, startup founders, and investors. </p><p>Marked by scandals, regulatory uncertainty, and lots of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt in crypto parlance), crypto winter brought down some of the industry's most significant projects and companies. </p><p>However, the US SEC’s successive approvals of eleven spot BTC ETF applications on January 10, 2024, changed all perspectives, turning many bullish. </p><p>It’s not just institutions that are optimistic about the development. Even smaller retail traders are excited about the new ETFs. If you are a retail trader sharing your strategies and showcasing a<a href="https://www.iconomi.com/crypto-portfolio-management"> public crypto portfolio for your audience</a>, the rising interest in Bitcoin will likely increase your following and boost your profitability.</p><h2>New ETF Products Introduced</h2><p>Wall Street came on strong, with the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bitcoin-etf-here-are-the-10-funds-set-to-debut-after-sec-decision-12fe591e">world's most prominent asset managers</a> like BlackRock, Fidelity, Valkyrie, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, ArkInvest/21 Shares, Grayscale, Bitwise, Invesco/Galaxy, and WisdomTree launching their Bitcoin ETFs with aggressive fanfare. </p><p>The multi-billion- and trillion-dollar institutions promoted and competed Bitcoin-based products in the open market for the first time. </p><p>The resulting billions of dollars in inflows broke ETF records and were a massive, unexpected win for Bitcoin. Allocations to US spot Bitcoin ETFs overwhelmed hundreds of millions in outflows to incumbent fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), raking in over <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/02/19/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-24b-weekly-inflows-blackrocks-ibit-leads-coinshares/">$2.4 billion</a> in the first week. </p><p>BlackRock's IBIT and Fidelity's FBTC brought in $1.6 billion and $648 million as they rounded up their first week. In addition, the two trillion-dollar asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity and the other funds offering spot Bitcoin ETFs have started a Bitcoin accumulation race. Bitcoin's price surged at the ETF news, rising past $50,000 for the first time since late 2021.</p><p>Thus, Bitcoin’s watershed moment appears to have begun. But what does it imply for money, wealth, and investing? What does it mean for cryptocurrency? Will the lines between decentralized assets and traditional products finally blur? Here, we discuss whether the historic approval of Bitcoin ETFs will mark a defining transformation in crypto and finance. </p><h2>How Do Spot Bitcoin ETFs Work?</h2><p>Spot Bitcoin Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) are financial products traded on public exchanges that track the performance of Bitcoin. </p><p>Unlike Bitcoin futures, which were approved years ago and have been traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), spot Bitcoin ETFs hold actual Bitcoin through a registered custodian. </p><p>An ETF buys BTC through authorized crypto exchanges or other Bitcoin holders. The Bitcoin is stored in a secure digital wallet using cold storage. Cold storage means the wallet is offline. In the case of spot ETFs, a designated custodian handles the crypto asset's cold storage and provides additional layers of security.</p><p>After secure storage is ensured, the ETF issues the corresponding shares. A share corresponds to Bitcoin or a specified unit of Bitcoin and must reflect the prevailing price. Shares are publicly traded on traditional stock exchanges. The ETF shares must follow the price of Bitcoin as closely as possible. ETFs must regularly rebalance their holdings, buying or selling their BTC as needed.</p><p>A spot ETF's price can depart from the underlying asset's value. To align the fund with the asset's real value and maintain the price, authorized participants (APs) are tasked to intervene. The process of creating and redeeming shares is done by the APs, which are typically large financial institutions. </p><p>The APs create or redeem shares based on market demand. Should ETF shares trade at a discount or premium, the APs redeem or create the ETF shares in large blocks. These measures arbitrage the difference so the share price aligns with the current Bitcoin price. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/spot-bitcoin-etfs/">APs profit from the arbitrage</a> opportunity when the ETF price deviates higher or lower versus the underlying asset’s value. </p><p>On the investor and trader side, buying a spot Bitcoin ETF is similar to buying regular shares in any security or ETF. Hence, investors can gain exposure to BTC indirectly by buying shares without holding the cryptocurrency. </p><p>Efficiency and liquidity in the market are maintained by market makers who keep offering to buy or sell shares of the ETF. Market maker activity is critical to Bitcoin ETF stability. They ensure that investors can easily buy or sell the asset whenever necessary.</p><h2>Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Game-changer for crypto?</h2><p>Bitcoin and the rest of crypto have come a long way since the early days when there were barely any exchanges to trade them. </p><p>However, digital assets have struggled to break through to the mainstream because of numerous regulatory challenges that heightened in the past few years. Negative statements from regulators and banks dampened sentiment and caused Bitcoin and the rest of crypto to flounder. </p><p>Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been through a challenging decade-long journey as well. The Winklevoss twins filed the first spot Bitcoin ETF, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, in 2013. It was rejected by the US SEC twice over risk-related concerns in what was once a nascent crypto industry. </p><p>Several followed since the Winklevoss ETF application, and all were greeted with a dozen rejections on the grounds of inadequate investor protection. The Clayton era of regulation, referring to the period when SEC Chair Jay Clayton was in charge, marked the lowest point for Bitcoin ETFs. </p><p>In the summer of 2018, the SEC rejected nine Bitcoin ETF applications in a single day. </p><p>Years later, Bitcoin and crypto scored an unlikely legal win when Grayscale fought the SEC’s rejection of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) application to convert to an ETF. A federal appeals court ruled that the SEC was mistaken in its rejection of Grayscale’s application, noting that the surveillance arrangements on the approved Bitcoin futures ETFs would suffice for spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p><p>As a result of this landmark win, the Securities and Exchange Commission could no longer use the same argument to reject future Bitcoin ETF applications of a similar nature. Under pressure, the new SEC Chair Gary Gensler issued a formal statement on January 10, 2024, approving the trading of several new spot Bitcoin ETP shares. </p><p>The unexpectedly triumphant arc of Bitcoin ETFs has ushered in optimism in the market. The approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, whose issuers include the largest asset manager in the US and the world, have potentially opened the floodgates for a new audience of retail investors and institutions—an audience with little or no experience in buying and selling cryptocurrency directly. </p><h2>Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs </h2><p>We’ve had a few weeks to observe the market response to spot Bitcoin ETFs. The approved ETFs have demonstrated tremendous inflows and record-breaking numbers. </p><h3>The “New Nine” Bitcoin ETFs: Early success</h3><p>The newly approved spot Bitcoin ETFs are popularly called the "new nine." Trading volumes for the new nine ETFs notched a new daily record. </p><p>As BTC surged to $54,938 on February 26, trading volumes for all nine ETFs topped $2.4 billion. According to data from Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-nine-spot-bitcoin-etf-volumes-reach-new-high">total volume on February 26</a> beat the prior record of $2.2 billion on January 11, the first trading day. These figures exclude the volume from Grayscale’s GBTC, a converted bitcoin ETF product.</p><p>BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT recorded its biggest trading day so far. Nasdaq data showed that over <a href="https://decrypt.co/219071/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-record-trading-volume">$1.3 billion in IBIT shares</a> were traded, exceeding its previous record of $1 billion when it debuted on January 10. </p><p>IBIT took the most volume out of all the ETFs. Fidelity’s FBTC placed second with $576 million in inflows. ARK 21 Shares (ARKB) recorded $276 million in inflows, while the Bitwise (BTB) spot Bitcoin ETF tallied $81 million. </p><h3>New institutional interest</h3><p>The exchange-traded funds have dramatically catalyzed new institutional interest in crypto. The US SEC's approval provides a favorable signal for large institutions and market participants waiting for more familiar access to the digital asset class outside of direct buys through crypto exchanges, which carry inherent custody and volatility risks.</p><figure>

US investors can now hold crypto in their brokerage accounts—something impossible before.</p><h3>Interest among retail investors</h3><p>Where institutions go, retail follows. The assurance of investor protection and the wide acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs will encourage retail to participate. Mass retail now has a relatively safe way to gain exposure to crypto through a regular brokerage account. </p><p>Bitcoin ETFs will inevitably bring crypto exposure to a more diverse set of holders with varying sizes and experiences in the market. Access to Bitcoin today is as simple as purchasing an ETF from a regulated asset manager. In addition, Bitcoin could start turning up in mainstream portfolios.</p><h3>New credibility and status for crypto</h3><p>The new kind of ETF could increase the distribution in the US and boost the credibility of crypto as an asset class, according to Kevin de Patoul, CEO of Keyrock, a crypto liquidity provider, in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/11/heres-what-a-bitcoin-etf-actually-means-for-investors.html#:~:text=%22This%20ETF%20has%20two%20main,liquidity%20provider%20Keyrock%2C%20told%20CNBC.">interview with CNBC</a>. </p><p>The idea of a US spot Bitcoin ETF significantly changes the public perception of Bitcoin. It eliminates doubts about Bitcoin's legitimacy and erases misconceptions about its infamous reputation as a tool to aid crime. This application has been proven to be a minor percentage of its overall use.</p><p>Hence, the US SEC's approval lent credibility and status primarily through regulatory certainty. Crypto is on its way to becoming a formal asset class, widely traded on any public exchange like other familiar investment vehicles. </p><h3>More crypto ETPs to follow</h3><p>The ability to hold Bitcoin in mainstream portfolios green-lights portfolio diversification into the crypto asset. Many expected significant capital inflows into the market and were satisfied. </p><p>A spot Ethereum ETF may not be far behind. <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/278672/valkyrie-cio-anticipates-spot-ethereum-etf-approval-will-take-1-2-years">Valkyrie CIO Steven McClurg</a> expects a spot Ethereum ETF approval within a year or two. If a spot Ethereum ETF is eventually launched, it could mark another boost for the status of crypto assets. </p><h3>ETF effect on BTC and crypto prices</h3><p>The record-breaking response to the bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin's price surge indicates the market's current sentiment. Both have continued to spur bullishness among investors and institutions.</p><p>The uptick in demand, coupled with diminishing supply, could cause an acceleration in price. As of this writing, BTC rose to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">above $59,000</a>.</p><p>Then, there is the question of history repeating itself. Experts point out how the total market cap of gold exploded after the first gold ETF was launched in 2004. Bitcoin, being digital gold, could follow the same path. </p><p>These days, Bitcoin ETF issuers have been buying approximately 10 to 12 times the amount of BTC produced daily. This has led to a 2 percent price increase or roughly $1,000 daily. Many experts agree that the demand from ETF issuers is the primary reason for the significant daily uptick. </p><p>An analysis by crypto startup founder, expert, and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/this-is-how-bitcoin-etf-inflows-are-affecting-btcs-price-movement/">Bitcoin investor Mark van der Chijs</a> found that the price jumps occurred around the settlement period before the opening of the US market. </p><p>The exponential nature of the demand has been pressing holders to sell their holdings to fill the ETF orders. These sales command higher prices as the current holders or users do not believe BTC is peaking. </p><p>The higher prices trigger FOMO (fear of missing out) among traders and ETF investors. The FOMO leads to higher demand, triggering a further increase in prices. </p><p>Many experts agree this market is uncharted territory. However, Van der Chijs is sticking to his prediction of $1,000 increases on average per trading day over the coming weeks.</p><h3>Incoming supply shock?</h3><p>At least two factors could contribute to a drastic increase in price and Bitcoin supply shock over the next three months: continued high demand for ETF shares and the Bitcoin halving event in April.</p><p>After the upcoming halving, miners' block rewards will be cut in half. As a result, the rate of BTC daily production will decrease. </p><p>At the moment, approximately 900 BTC is being created daily. After the halving event, this number will drop to 450 BTC. This will further dwindle the supply and lead to a discrepancy in supply and demand. The production slash could lead to higher BTC prices as investors of all levels and ETF issuers scramble to increase holdings.</p><p>There is a risk of ETFs failing too soon. Most financial advisors, therefore, allow the sale of shares 90 days past launch or after 90 days of trading. As the ETFs started trading on January 11, the 90-day period should commence by early May, further pushing BTC’s price upward.</p><p>It is possible to have a black swan event, seeing BTC break its previous record of $69,000 and achieve a new all-time high before the halving. Chijs predicts $100,000 BTC in the coming two to three months. </p><h3>Impact on the broader financial ecosystem</h3><p>Some have noted that big banks were notably absent during the ETF action. Banks can participate in the ETF ecosystem but need the US SEC to redefine crypto assets. </p><p>In a stunning move, a trade group coalition making up the Banking Policy Institute asked the SEC to modify the rules around crypto asset custody, allowing them to act as custodians, as is the regular practice for most ETPs. Bitcoin proponents would not have imagined such interest back in the day, but here we are.</p><h3>Increased competition: Fee wars</h3><p>Despite significant Grayscale-related outflows in the first few days, ETFs stabilized to massive net-positive inflows. Expect competition among Bitcoin ETFs for features and fees. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the most expensive—offering 1.5 percent in fees. Bitwise opts not to charge fees for the first six months and then caps them at 0.2 percent afterward. </p><h2>A New Era Merging Wall Street, Crypto, and Main Street</h2><p>The triumphant launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs broke all expectations and models. Early on, ETF issuers were able to bridge Wall Street, crypto, and Main Street by creating a familiar and easily accessible investment product. </p><p>The early success of ETFs has numerous implications for the status of digital assets, the demand around Bitcoin, the dynamism of crypto trading, the total crypto market cap, and how people build mainstream portfolios from now on. </p><p>Spot Bitcoin ETFs are a crucial milestone in the maturity of Bitcoin and crypto as an asset class. They officially begin significant institutional involvement with trillion-dollar players competing for dominance.

The rationale is understandable: if criminals won’t be able to use their money, they will have to eventually stop whatever they are doing and go get a 9 to 5 job.</p><p>However, after 20 years of ever tighter (and ever more expensive) AML regulations, the levels of organized crime, tax evasion, or drug use do not show any signs of decrease. At the same time, the basic right to privacy is being unceremoniously violated on an everyday basis, with each financial operation, no matter how tiny, being subject to extensive verifications and tons of paperwork. Check Part 1 of this story for details and numbers.</p><p>This prompts a question: should we reconsider our approach to the AML strategy?</p><p>Two years ago, a fintech author David G.W. Birch wrote an<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2021/05/03/im-anti-the-anti-money-laundering--rules/?sh=3f17483e3111"> article</a> for Forbes, reflecting on the main principle of AML – gatekeeping. The key thought could be resumed as “instead of trying to prevent criminals from getting into the system, we let them in and monitor what they are up to.”</p><p>Indeed, why do we erect expensive AML gates and force the bad guys to turn to hardly traceable cash or works of art, while we can simply let them in and follow the money to hunt them down? To do so, we can use both the existing reporting system within traditional finance and the on-chain analytics within the blockchain. However, while the former is more or less understandable, the latter is still a mystery for most people. What’s more, politicians and bankers regularly accuse crypto of being a tool for criminals, tax evaders, and all sorts of Satan worshipers, further exacerbating the misunderstanding.</p><p>To shed more light on this matter, we need to better understand how on-chain analytics works. It is not an obvious task though: blockchain analysis methods are often proprietary and analytics companies sharing them could risk losing their business edge. However, some of them, like Chainalysis, publish rather detailed documentation, while the Luxembourgish firm Scorechain agreed to share some details of their trade for this story. Combining this data can give us a good idea of the potential and limitations of on-chain analytics.</p><h2>How does on-chain analytics work?</h2><p>The blockchain is transparent and auditable by anyone. However, not everyone is capable of drawing meaningful conclusions from the myriads of datasets it is composed of. Gathering data, identifying the entities, and putting the conclusions into a readable format is the specialty of on-chain analytic firms.</p><p>It all starts with getting a copy of the ledger, i.e. synchronizing the internal software with the blockchains.</p><p>Then, a tedious stage of mapping begins. How can we know that this address belongs to an exchange, and this one – to a darknet marketplace? Analysts employ all their creativity and resourcefulness to try and de-pseudonymize the blockchain as much as they can. Any technique is good as long as it works: collecting open-source data from law enforcement, scraping websites, navigating Twitter-X and other social media, acquiring data from specialized blockchain explorers like Etherscan, following the trace of stolen funds upon requests from attorneys… Some services are identified by interacting with them, i.e. sending funds to centralized exchanges to identify their addresses. To reduce the errors, the data is often cross-checked with different sources.</p><p>Once the addresses are identified to the best of one’s ability, one can see a bit clearer in the maze of transaction hashes. Yet, the picture is still far from complete. If for account-based blockchains like Ethereum identifying an address allows tracking its funds in a rather straightforward manner, for UTXO blockchains like Bitcoin, the situation is much less obvious.</p><p>Indeed, unlike Ethereum, which keeps track of addresses, Bitcoin blockchain keeps track of the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO). Each transaction always sends all the coins associated with an address. If a person wishes to spend only a part of their coins, the unspent part, also known as change, is assigned to a newly created address controlled by the sender.</p><p>It is the job of on-chain analytics firms to make sense of these movements and determine clusters of UTXO associated with the same entity.</p><h2>Can on-chain analytics be trusted?</h2><p>On-chain analytics is not an exact science. Both the mapping and the clustering of UTXO rely on experience and a carefully calibrated set of heuristics each company has developed for itself.</p><p>This issue was highlighted last July in the court hearing involving Chainalysis, which had provided its forensic expertise in the US v Sterlingov case. The firm’s representative<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59988850/149/1/united-states-v-sterlingov/"> admitted</a> that not only its methods were not peer-reviewed or otherwise scientifically validated, but also the firm did not keep track of its false positives. In Chainalysis defense, the first point is understandable: the methods that each firm uses to analyze the blockchain are closely guarded trade secrets. However, the issue of false positives must be tackled better, especially if it could end up sending someone to jail.</p><p>Scorechain uses a different approach, erring on the side of caution and only choosing the methods that do not generate false positives in the clustering process, such as the multi-input heuristics (assumption that in a single transaction all input addresses come from one entity). Unlike Chainalysis, they do not use any change heuristics, which produce a lot of false positives. In some cases, their team can manually track UTXOs if a human operator has enough reasons to do so, but overall, this approach tolerates blind spots, counting on the additional information in the future that would fill them in.</p><p>The very notion of heuristics – i.e. strategies that employ a practical but not necessarily scientifically proven approach to problem-solving – implies that it cannot guarantee 100% reliability. It is the outcome that measures its effectiveness. The FBI stating that Chainalysis’ methods are “generally reliable” could serve as proof of quality, but it would be better if all on-chain analytics firms could start measuring and sharing their rates of false positives and false negatives.</p><h2>Seeing through the fog</h2><p>There are ways of obfuscating the trace of funds or making them more difficult to find. Crypto hackers and scammers are known to use all kinds of techniques: chain hopping, privacy blockchains, mixers…</p><p>Some of them, like swapping or bridging assets, can be traced by on-chain analytics firms. Others, like the privacy chain Monero, or various mixers and tumblers, often can’t. There were, however,<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2022/02/22/exclusive-austrian-programmer-and-ex-crypto-ceo-likely-stole-11-billion-of-ether/?sh=24fc27b47f58"> instances</a> when Chainalysis claimed to de-mix transactions passed through a mixer, and most recently Finnish authorities <a href="https://www.mtvuutiset.fi/artikkeli/vastaamo-jutussa-iso-paljastus-krp-jaljitti-jaljittamattomana-pidettya-kryptovaluuttaa/8864046#gs.46q5e9">announced</a> that they have tracked Monero transactions as part of an investigation.</p><p>In any case, the very fact of having used these masking techniques is very much visible and can serve as a red flag for any AML purposes. The US Treasury adding last year the smart contract address of Tornado Cash mixer to the OFAC list is one such example. Now, when the coins’ history is traced down to this mixer, the funds are suspected of belonging to illicit actors. This is not great news for privacy advocates, but rather reassuring for crypto AML.</p><p>One might ask what’s the point of flagging the mixed coins and tracing them across blockchains if we don’t have a concrete person to pin them to, like in the banking system? Luckily, criminals have to interact with the non-criminal world, and the tainted money sooner or later ends up either at goods or service providers, or at a bank account, and this is where law enforcement can identify the actual persons. This is how the FBI got its biggest-ever<a href="https://time.com/6146749/cryptocurrency-laundering-bitfinex-hack/"> seizure of $4.5 billion worth of Bitcoin</a> (in 2022 prices) following the Bitfinex hack. This also works in reverse: if law enforcement gets access to a criminal’s private keys, they can move up the blockchain history to identify the addresses that had interacted with it at some point. This is how the London Metropolitan Police uncovered a whole drug dealing network from one single arrest (source: Chainalysis’ Crypto Crime 2023 report).</p><p>Crime has existed since the dawn of humanity, and will probably accompany it till its end, using ever-evolving camouflaging techniques. Luckily, crime detection methods follow suit, and it happens that the blockchain is an ideal environment for deploying digital forensics tools. After all, it is transparent and accessible to everyone (which by the way cannot be said about the banking sector).</p><p>One can argue that current on-chain analysis methods need to be improved – and that point holds true. However, it is clear that even in this imperfect form it is already an efficient tool for tracking bad guys on-chain. Perhaps, then, it’s time to reconsider our approach to AML and let the criminals into the blockchain?</p><p><em>A special thank you to the Scorechain team for sharing their knowledge.</em></p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Marie Poteriaieva</em><em>.

                    <p>As we get closer and closer to the impending Bitcoin halving, the combined pressures of wildly increasing demand and shrinking supply have created an unusual market, turning a historically positive omen into an explosive opportunity for profit.</p><p>The Bitcoin ETF approval has changed the face of Bitcoin as we know it. Since the SEC made its fateful decision in January, the resultant developments have caused worldwide upheaval; billions have flown into these new investment opportunities, and regulators in many countries are considering the role of Bitcoin in the financial establishment. Despite some initial setbacks, the market has comfortably <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/bitcoin-hits-new-heights-between">hit</a> new all-time highs, and the price has stayed in a very impressive range even despite fluctuations. </p><p>Nevertheless, we are in a very unique situation that can impact the market in unpredictable ways. Bitcoin’s next halving is set to arrive in April, and this will be the <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/history-of-bitcoin-halvings">first time</a> in its entire history that the halving will coincide with an all-time high for price. Although there have been a great deal of differences between each of the major halvings, a trend has been generally noticeable: even if there are huge steady gains, it is in the ballpark of a year to 18 months before Bitcoin breaks all records with a true price spike. One year out from the halving in June 2016, Bitcoin had more than doubled; yet a few months later, the growth was closer to 30x.</p><figure>

                    <p>There is plenty of optimism from substantial industry players, such as Standard Chartered’s bold <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/150000-standard-chartered-bitcoin-price-forecast-2024">prediction</a> that Bitcoin’s value will more than double to $150k before the year is over. However, their analysis of the situation is not mostly based on halving trends but on the rampaging success of the Bitcoin ETF, and that success has also thrown us a curveball. As community <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bgxnpz/interesting_numbers_halving_next_month/">discussion</a> has been quick to point out, these major ETF issuers have been pouring billions into bitcoin, buying at <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/10/blackrocks-spot-etf-nears-200k-bitcoin-passing-michael-saylors-microstrategy/">astounding</a> rates and amassing some of the world’s largest Bitcoin supplies practically overnight. If they collectively purchase more than even the worldwide community, how will they react when the spigot of new coins shuts to a trickle?</p><p>In other words, we are headed into a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-halving-cryptocurrency-markets-investors-etf-spot-btc-supply-demand-2024-3">situation</a> where demand is at an all-time high and there is insufficient supply to meet it. <em>Business Insider</em> called the upcoming halving a “momentous event”, considering that the ETF had made “permanent changes to Bitcoin’s underlying infrastructure." Coinshares <a href="https://theblock.co/post/283062/bitcoin-positive-demand-shock-registered-investment-advisors">echoed</a> these sentiments with the warning of a positive demand shock, as Head of Research James Butterfill claimed that “The launch of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs on January 11 has led to an average daily demand of 4500 bitcoins (trading days only), while only an average of 921 new bitcoin were minted per day.” And that’s only considering the pre-halving mining rates. The ETF issuers are already relying on secondhand Bitcoin sales to fill up their coffers, and this trend seems certain to increase in the immediate future. </p><p>Isn’t this a good thing, though? Positive demand shocks, as a rule, are <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060115/what-are-some-common-examples-demand-shock.asp#toc-positive-demand-shocks">generally</a> associated with jumps in price. Additionally, even though shocks like this in critical commodities like oil can lead to inflation, Bitcoin is not yet an essential component of the entire world economy. It’s unlikely that the same drawbacks will apply just yet. In other words, the answer is generally yes, but the situation can still cause alarming trends. For example, the night of March 18 saw a truly bewildering <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/19/bitcoin-flash-crashed-to-89k-on-bitmex/">development</a>: coasting at highs around $70k, Bitcoin’s value on BitMEX crashed below $9k in the blink of an eye. The price recovered quickly and was, in any event, isolated to this one exchange, but it’s still an unprecedented development. </p><figure>

                    <p>BitMEX announced that the culprit of this negative price spike was a series of large sell orders in the middle of the night, and that they were investigating the activity. Several anonymous whales in particular have emerged as the likely candidates for these sales. We still have no idea who exactly they are or who was buying bitcoins at such a prodigious rate, but it’s only an example of how major selloffs can torpedo market confidence. In any event, this one episode is only a particularly sharp example of a general <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-traders-60k-btc-price-support-futures-gap">trend</a>; “constant” spot selling as Bitcoin’s price receives a bloody nose. The market hit lows of $62k Tuesday afternoon, while it was nearly at $72k on the morning of the previous Friday.</p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>Traders have nevertheless remained totally optimistic that these price dips are nothing more than the “bear trap” associated with the pre-halving environment, and they aren’t the only ones. Prominent executives including Binance CEO Richard Teng and Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek have <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-entering-pre-halving-danger-zone-binance-crypto-ceos-bullish">endorsed</a> the viewpoint that these kinds of price dips are a perfectly natural and temporary component of a scheduled halving. There is a clearly observable trend of substantial price dips, from 20-40%, in the weeks immediately prior to the most recent halvings. And yet, the price bounced back quickly and completely, and went on to new all-time heights.</p><figure>

                    <p>In other words, some of the recent and sudden price dives are fully explainable using data from Bitcoin’s history. The relevant questions for us, then, are whether Bitcoin’s future will follow the same line. The fact of the matter is that all the available signs point to an optimistic long-term forecast. A positive demand shock caused by ETF acquisitions and the halving may very well make it more difficult for an average consumer to buy bitcoin, but how will that difficulty manifest? Higher prices. Besides, a selling point of the ETF is that plenty of average consumers will use it to seek exposure to bitcoin’s profits, rather than direct custody. This alone will encourage ETF issuers to keep their buying pressure high. It’s impossible to say how long this market situation will continue or what it will mean for bitcoin’s use as an actual currency, but there’s nothing in the current situation to suggest that bitcoin won’t keep growing.</p><p>Is it any wonder, then, that the community is gearing up to <a href="https://www.bitcoinhalving.com/">welcome</a> the halving with such bated breath? Prominent industry figures are taking great care to prepare “The Biggest Celebration in Bitcoin” with live coverage and meetup events in 7 countries (and counting), and the halving isn’t even expected for another month. It’s very possible that 2024 will be remembered as the year that Bitcoin truly became enmeshed in the global financial infrastructure, if stunning regulatory victories in January turn to unprecedented growth by December. Really, the major significant concern is whether or not Bitcoin will see diminished usage as a currency when its worth in fiat is so valuable. Nevertheless, the signs from right now seem quite clear: Bitcoin is set to blaze a trail into the future.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTUzODk2OTUwMTQ2Mzk3/default_a_very_choppy_ocean_with_large_waves_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTUzODk2OTUwMTQ2Mzk3/default_a_very_choppy_ocean_with_large_waves_1.jpg"><media:title>default_a_very_choppy_ocean_with_large_waves_1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTUzNTQyMzQ2OTA5MjQ4/53a2cfbf-f838-4aa8-a623-cf0fdca404e2_1024x588.jpg"><media:title>53a2cfbf-f838-4aa8-a623-cf0fdca404e2_1024x588</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://blockworks.co/news/history-of-bitcoin-halvings">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTUzNTQ5MDU3Nzk1NjQ4/93957319-512b-456d-a3de-7547515ec771_1600x877.jpg"><media:title>93957319-512b-456d-a3de-7547515ec771_1600x877</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/19/bitcoin-flash-crashed-to-89k-on-bitmex/">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTUzNTYxNjc0MjYxODUz/b628cfbd-a80f-4a48-b9bc-73c361c8b980_1600x1129.jpg"><media:title>b628cfbd-a80f-4a48-b9bc-73c361c8b980_1600x1129</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-entering-pre-halving-danger-zone-binance-crypto-ceos-bullish">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Random Access Markets: The Free Market Of Information]]></title><description><![CDATA[Information is one of the most valuable commodities in the world, Bitcoin is information transmuted into money.

In the smartphone era, unless extreme precautions are taken, everywhere you go, everything you say, and everything you consume is quantifiable among the infinite spectrum of the information goods markets. Information goods, being inherently nonphysical bits of data, can be conceptualized, crafted, produced, or manufactured, disseminated, and consumed exclusively as digital entities. The internet, along with other digital technologies for computation and communication, serves as a comprehensive e-commerce infrastructure, facilitating the entire life cycle of designing, producing, distributing, and consuming a wide array of information goods. The seamless transition of existing information goods from traditional formats to digital formats is easily achievable, not to mention the collection of media formats completely infeasible in the analog world.</p><p>A preliminary examination of products within the information goods industry reveals that, while they all exist as pure information products and are uniformly impacted by technological advancements, their respective markets undergo distinct economic transformation processes. These variations in market evolution are inherently tied to differences in product characteristics, production methods, distribution channels, and consumption patterns. Notably, the separation of value creation and revenue processes introduces opportunistic scenarios, potentially leaving established market players with unprofitable customer bases and costly yet diminishing value-creation processes.</p><p>Simultaneously, novel organizational architectures may emerge in response to evolving technological conditions, effectively creating and destroying traditional information good markets overnight. The value chains, originally conceived under the assumptions of the traditional information goods economy, undergo radical redesigns as new strategies and tooling materialize in response to the transformative influence of digital production, distribution, and consumption on conventional value propositions for data. For example, mass surveillance was never practical when creating even a single photo meant hours of labor within a specialized photo development room with specific chemical and lightning conditions. Now that there is a camera on every corner, a microphone in every pocket, a ledger entry for every financial transaction, and the means to transmit said data essentially for free across the planet, the market conditions for mass surveillance have unsurprisingly given rise to mass surveillance as a service.</p><p>An entirely new industry of “location firms” has grown, with <em>The Markup</em> having demarcated nearly 50 companies selling location data as a service in a 2021 article titled “There’s a Multibillion-Dollar Market for Your Phone’s Location Data” by Keegan and Ng. One such firm, Near, is self-described as curating “one of the world’s largest sources of intelligence on People and Places”, having gathered data representing nearly two billion people across 44 countries. According to a <em>Grand View Research</em> report titled “Location Intelligence Market Size And Share Report, 2030”, the global location intelligence data market cap was worth an estimated “$16.09 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.6% from 2023 to 2030”. The market cap of this new information goods industry is mainly “driven by the growing penetration of smart devices and increasing investments in IoT [internet of things] and network services as it facilitates smarter applications and better network connectivity”, giving credence to the idea that technological advancement front-runs network growth which front-runs entirely new forms of e-commerce markets. This, of course, was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, in which government policies resulted in “the increased adoption of location intelligence solutions to manage the changing business scenario as it helps businesses to analyze, map, and share data in terms of the location of their customers”, under the guise of user and societal health.</p><p>Within any information goods market, there are only two possible outcomes for market participants: distributing the acquired data or keeping it for yourself. </p><figure>

                    <h2>The Modern Information Goods Market</h2><p>In the fall of 2021, China launched the Shanghai Data Exchange (SDE) in an attempt to create a state-owned monopoly on a novel speculative commodities market for data scraped from one of the most digitally surveilled populations on the planet. The SDE offered 20 data products at launch, including customer flight information from China Eastern Airlines, as well as data from telecommunications network operators such as China Unicom, China Telecom, and China Mobile. Notably, one of the first known trades made at the SDE was the Commercial Bank of China purchasing data from the state-owned Shanghai Municipal Electric Power Company under the guise of improving their financial services and product offerings. </p><p>Shortly before the founding of this data exchange, Huang Qifan, the former mayor of Chongqing, was quoted saying that “the state should monopolize the rights to regulate data and run data exchanges”, while also suggesting that the CCP should be highly selective in setting up data exchanges. “Like stock exchanges, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen can have one, but a general provincial capital city or a municipal city should not have it.” </p><p>While the current information goods market has led to such innovations such as speculation on the purchasing of troves of user data, the modern data market was started in earnest at the end of the 1970s, exemplified in the formation of Oracle Corporation in 1977, named after the CIA’s “Project Oracle”, which featured eventual Oracle Corporation co-founders Larry Ellison, Robert Miner, and Ed Oates. The CIA was their first customer, and in 2002, nearly $2.5 billion worth of contracts came from selling software to federal, state, and local governments, accounting for nearly a quarter of their total revenue. Only a few months after September 11, 2001, Ellison penned an op-ed for <em>The</em> <em>New York Times </em>titled “A Single National Security Database” in which the opening paragraph reads “The single greatest step we Americans could take to make life tougher for terrorists would be to ensure that all the information in myriad government databases was copied into a single, comprehensive national security database”. Ellison was quoted in Jeffrey Rosen’s book <em>The Naked Crowd</em> as saying “The Oracle database is used to keep track of basically everything. The information about your banks, your checking balance, your savings balance, is stored in an Oracle database. Your airline reservation is stored in an Oracle database. What books you bought on Amazon is stored in an Oracle database. Your profile on Yahoo! is stored in an Oracle database”. Rosen made note of a discussion with David Carney, a former top-three employee at the CIA, who, after 32 years of service at the agency, left to join Oracle just two months after 9/11 to lead its Information Assurance Center:</p><p>"How do you say this without sounding callous?" [Carney] asked. "In some ways, 9/11 made business a bit easier. Previous to 9/11 you pretty much had to hype the threat and the problem." Carney said that the summer before the attacks, leaders in the public and private sectors wouldn't sit still for a briefing. Then his face brightened. "Now they clamor for it!"</p><p>This relationship has continued for 20 years, and in November 2022, the CIA awarded its Commercial Cloud Enterprise contract to five American companies — Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Google, IBM, and Oracle. While the CIA did not disclose the exact value of the contract, documents released in 2019 suggested it could be “tens of billions” of dollars over the next 15 years. Unfortunately, this is far from the only data market integration of the private sector, government agencies, and the intelligence community, perhaps best exemplified by data broker LexisNexis.</p><p>LexisNexis was founded in 1970, and is, as of 2006, the world’s largest electronic database for legal and public-records-related information. According to their own website, LexisNexis describes themselves as delivering “a comprehensive suite of solutions to arm government agencies with superior data, technology and analytics to support mission success”. LexisNexis consists of nine board members: CEO Haywood Talcove; Dr. Richard Tubb, the longest serving White House physician in U.S. history; Stacia Hylton, former Deputy Director of the U.S. Marshal Service; Brian Stafford, former Director of the U.S. Secret Service; Lee Rivas, CEO for the public sector and health care business units of LexisNexis Risk Solutions; Howard Safir, former NYPD Commissioner and Associate Director of Operations for the U.S. Marshals Service; Floyd Clarke, former Director of the FBI; Henry Udow, Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary for the RELX Group; and lastly Alan Wade, retired Chief Information Officer for the CIA.</p><p>While Wade was still employed by the CIA, he founded Chiliad with Christine Maxwell, sister of Ghislaine Maxwell, and daughter of Robert Maxwell. Christine Maxwell is considered “an early internet pioneer”, having founded Magellan in 1993, one of the premier search engines on the internet. After selling Magellan to Excite, she reinvested her substantial windfall into another big data search technology company: the aforementioned Chiliad. According to a 2020 report by OYE.NEWS, Chiliad made use of “on-demand, massively scalable, intelligent mining of structured and unstructured data through the use of natural language search technologies”, with the firm’s proprietary software being “behind the data search technology used by the FBI’s counterterrorism data warehouse”.</p><p>As recently as November 2023, the Wade-connected LexisNexis was given a $16-million, five-year contract with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection “for access to a powerful suite of surveillance tools”, according to available public records, providing access to “social media monitoring, web data such as email addresses and IP address locations, real-time jail booking data, facial recognition services, and cell phone geolocation data analysis tools”. Unfortunately, this is far from the only government agency to utilize LexisNexis’ data brokerage with the aims of circumnavigating constitutional law and civil liberties in regards to surveillance. </p><p>In the fall of 2020, LexisNexis was forced to settle for over $5 million after a class action lawsuit alleged the broker sold Department of Motor Vehicle data to U.S. law firms, who were then free to use it for their own business purposes. "Defendants websites allow the purchase of crash reports by report date, location, or driver name and payment by credit card, prepaid bulk accounts or monthly accounts”, the complaint reads. "Purchasers are not required to establish any permissible use provided in the DPPA to obtain access to Plaintiffs' and Class Members' MVRs”. In the summer of 2022, a Freedom of Information Act request revealed a $22 million contract between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and LexisNexis. Sejal Zota, a director at Just Futures Law and a practicing attorney working on the lawsuit, made note that LexisNexis makes it possible for ICE to "instantly access sensitive personal data — all without warrants, subpoenas, any privacy safeguards or any show of reasonableness”.</p><p>In the aforementioned complaint from 2022, the use of LexisNexis’ Accurint product allows "law enforcement officers [to] surveil and track people based on information these officers would not, in many cases, otherwise be able to obtain without a subpoena, court order, or other legal process…enabling a massive surveillance state with files on almost every adult U.S. consumer”.</p><h2>A Series Of Tubes</h2><p>In 2013, it came to the public’s attention that the National Security Agency had covertly breached the primary communication links connecting Yahoo and Google data centers worldwide. This information was based on documents published by WikiLeaks, originally obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, and corroborated by interviews of government officials.</p><p>As per a classified report dated January 9, 2013, the NSA transmits millions of records daily from internal Yahoo and Google networks to data repositories at the agency's Fort Meade, Maryland headquarters. In the preceding month, field collectors processed and returned 181,280,466 new records, encompassing "metadata" revealing details about the senders and recipients of emails, along with time stamps, as well as the actual content, including text, audio, and video data.</p><p>The primary tool employed by the NSA to exploit these data links is a project named MUSCULAR, carried out in collaboration with the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). Operating from undisclosed interception points, the NSA and GCHQ copy entire data streams through fiber-optic cables connecting the data centers of major Silicon Valley corporations. </p><p>This becomes particularly perplexing when considering that, as revealed by a classified document acquired by <em>The Washington Post</em> in 2013, both the NSA and the FBI were already actively tapping into the central servers of nine prominent U.S. internet companies. This covert operation involved extracting audio and video chats, photographs, emails, documents, and connection logs, providing analysts with the means to monitor foreign targets. The method of extraction, as outlined in the document, involves direct collection from the servers of major U.S. service providers: Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube, and Apple.</p><p>During the same period, the newspaper <em>The Guardian </em>reported that GCHQ — the British counterpart to the NSA — was clandestinely gathering intelligence from these internet companies through a collaborative effort with the NSA. According to documents obtained by <em>The Guardian</em>, the PRISM program seemingly allows GCHQ to bypass the formal legal procedures required in Britain to request personal materials such as emails, photos, and videos, from internet companies based outside the country.</p><p>PRISM emerged in 2007 as a successor to President George W. Bush's secret program of warrantless domestic surveillance, following revelations from the news media, lawsuits, and interventions by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Congress responded with the Protect America Act in 2007 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, providing legal immunity to private companies cooperating voluntarily with U.S. intelligence collection. Microsoft became PRISM's inaugural partner, marking the beginning of years of extensive data collection beneath the surface of a heated national discourse on surveillance and privacy.</p><p>In a June 2013 statement, then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said “information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats. The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans”.</p><p>So why the need for collection directly from fiber optic cables if these private companies <em>themselves </em>are already providing data to the national intelligence community? Upon further inquiry into the aforementioned data brokers to the NSA and CIA, it would appear that a vast majority of the new submarine fiber optic cables — essential infrastructure to the actualization of the internet as a global data market — are being built out by these same private companies. These inconspicuous cables weave across the global ocean floor, transporting 95-99% of international data through bundles of fiber-optic strands scarcely thicker than a standard garden hose. In total, the active network comprises over 1,100,000 kilometers of submarine cables.</p><p>Traditionally, these cables have been owned by a consortium of private companies, primarily telecom providers. However, a notable shift has emerged. In 2016, a significant surge in submarine cable development began, and notably, this time, the purchasers are content providers — particularly the data brokers Meta/Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Of note is Google, having acquired over 100,000 kilometers of submarine cables. With the completion of the Curie Cable in 2019, Google's ownership of submarine cables globally stands at 1.4%, as measured by length. When factoring in cables with shared ownership, Google's overall share increases to approximately 8.5%. Facebook is shortly behind with 92,000 kilometers, with Amazon at 30,000, and Microsoft with around 6,500 kilometers from the partially owned MAREA cable. </p><p>There is a notable revival in the undersea cable sector, primarily fueled by investments from Facebook and Google, accounting for around 80% of 2018-2020 investments in transatlantic connections — a significant increase from the less than 20% they accounted for in the preceding three years through 2017, as reported by TeleGeography. This wave of digital giants has fundamentally transformed the dynamics of the industry. Unlike traditional practices where phone companies established dedicated ventures for cable construction, often connecting England to the U.S. for voice calls and limited data traffic, these internet companies now wield considerable influence. They can dictate the cable landing locations, strategically placing them near their data centers, and have the flexibility to modify the line structures — typically costing around $200 million for a transatlantic link — without waiting for partner approvals. These technology behemoths aim to capitalize on the increasing demand for rapid data transfers essential for various applications, including streaming movies, social messaging, and even telemedicine.<br><br></p><p>The last time we saw such an explosion of activity in building out essential internet infrastructure was during the dot-com boom of the 1990s, in which phone companies spent over $20 billion to install fiber-optic lines beneath the oceans, immediately before the massive proliferation of personal computers, home internet modems, and peer-to-peer data networks.</p><h2>Data Laundering </h2><p>The birthing of new compression technologies in the form of digital media formats itself would not have given rise to the panopticon we currently operate under without the ability to obfuscate mass uploading and downloading of this newly created data via the ISP rails of both public and private sector infrastructure companies. There is likely no accident that the creation of these tools, networks, and algorithms were created under the influence of national intelligence agencies right before the turn of the millennium, the rise of broadband internet, and the sweeping unconstitutional spying on citizens made legal via the Patriot Act in the aftermath of the events on September 11, 2001. </p><p>Only 15 years old, Sean Parker, the eventual founder of Napster and first president of Facebook — a former DARPA project titled LifeLog — caught the gaze of the FBI for his hacking exploits, ending in state-appointed community ser­vice. One year later, Parker was recruited by the CIA after winning a Virginia state computer science fair by developing an early internet crawling application. Instead of continuing his studies, he interned for a D.C. startup, FreeLoader, and eventually UUNet, an internet service provider. “I wasn’t going to school,” Parker told <em>Forbes</em>. “I was technically in a co-op program but in truth was just going to work.” Parker made nearly six figures his senior year of high school, eventually starting the peer-to-peer music-sharing site that became Napster in 1999. While working on Napster, Parker met investor Ron Conway, who has backed every Parker product since, having also previously backed PayPal, Google, and Twitter, among others. Napster has been credited as one of the fastest-growing businesses of all time, and its influence on information goods and data markets in the internet age cannot be overstated.</p><p>In a study conducted between April 2000 and November 2001 by Sandvine titled “Peer-to-peer File Sharing: The Impact of File Sharing on Service Provider Networks”, network measurements revealed a notable shift in bandwidth consumption patterns due to the launch of new peer-to-peer tooling, as well as new compression algorithms such as .MP3. Specifically, the percentage of network bandwidth attributed to Napster traffic saw an increase from 23% to 30%, whereas web-related traffic experienced a slight decrease from 20% to 19%. By 2002, observations indicated that file-sharing traffic was consuming a substantial portion, up to 60%, of internet service providers' bandwidth. The creation of new information good markets comes downstream of new technological capabilities, with implications on the scope and scale of current data stream proliferation, clearly noticeable within the domination of internet user activity belonging to peer-to-peer network communications.</p><p>Of course, peer-to-peer technology did not cease to advance after Napster, and the invention of “swarms”, a style of downloading and uploading essential to the development of Bram Cohen’s BitTorrent, were invented for eDonkey2000 by Jed McCaleb — the eventual founder of Mt.Gox, Ripple Labs, and the Stellar Foundation. The proliferation of advanced packet exchange over the internet has led to entirely new types of information good markets, essentially boiling down to three main axioms; public and permanent data, selectively private data, and coveted but difficult-to-obtain data. </p><figure>

                    <h2>Bitcoin-native Data Markets</h2><h3>Parent/Child Recursive Inscriptions</h3><p>While publishing directly to Bitcoin is hardly a new phenomenon, the popularization of Ord — released by Bitcoin developer Casey Rodarmor in 2022 — has led to a massive increase in interest and activity in Bitcoin-native publishing. While certainly some of this can be attributed to a newly formed artistic culture siphoning away activity and value from Ethereum — and other alternative businesses making erroneous claims of blockchain-native publishing — the majority of this volume comes downstream from the construction of these inscription transactions that use the SegWit discount via specially authored Taproot script, and the awareness of the immutability, durability, and availability of data offered solely by the Bitcoin blockchain. The SegWit discount was specifically created to incentivize the consolidation of unspent transaction outputs and limit the creation of excessive change in the UTXO set, but as for its implications on Bitcoin-native publishing, it has essentially created a substantial 75% markdown on the cost of bits within a block that are stuffed with arbitrary data within an inscription. This is far from a non-factor in the creation of a sustainable information goods market.</p><p>Taking this one step further, the implementation of a self-referential inscription mechanism allows users to string data publishing across multiple Bitcoin blocks, limiting the costs from fitting a file into a single block auction. This implies both the ability to inscribe files beyond 4 MB, as well as the utility to reference previously inscribed material, such as executable software, code for generative art, or the image assets themselves. In the case of the recent Project Spartacus, recursive inscriptions that use what is known as a parent inscription were used in order to allow essentially a crowdfunding mechanism in order to publicly source the satoshis needed to publish the Afghan War logs onto the Bitcoin blockchain forever. This solves for the need of public and permanent publishing of known and available data by a pseudonymous set of users, but requires certain data availability during the minting process itself, which opens the door to centralized pressure points and potential censoring of inscription transactions within a public mint by nefarious mining pools.</p><h3>Precursive Inscriptions</h3><p>With the advent of Bitcoin-native inscriptions, the possibility of immutable, durable, and censorship-reduced publishing has come to fruition. The current iteration of inscription technology allows for users to post their data via a permanent but publicly propagated Bitcoin transaction. However, this reality has led to yet-to-be confirmed inscription transactions and their associated data being noticed while within the mempool itself. This issue can be mitigated by introducing encryption within the inscription process, leaving encrypted but otherwise innocuous data to be propagated by Bitcoin nodes and eventually published by Bitcoin miners, but with no ability to be censored due to content. This also removes the ability for inscriptions meant for speculation to be front-run by malicious collectors who pull inscription data from the mempool and rebroadcast it at an increased fee rate in order to be confirmed sooner.</p><p>Precursive inscriptions aim to create the private, encrypted publishing of data spread out over multiple Bitcoin blocks that can be published at a whim via a recursive publishing transaction containing the private key to decrypt the previously inscribed data. For instance, a collective of whistleblowers could discreetly upload data to the Bitcoin blockchain, unbeknownst to miners or node runners, while deferring its publication until a preferred moment. Since the data will be encrypted during its initial inscribing phase, and since the data will be seemingly uncorrelated until it is recursively associated by the publishing transaction, a user can continually resign and propagate the time-locked parent inscription for extended durations of time. If the user cannot sign a further time-locked publishing transaction due to incarceration, the propagated publishing transaction will be confirmed after the time-lock period ends, thus giving the publisher a dead man’s switch mechanism.</p><p>The specially authored precursive inscription process presented in this article offers a novel approach to secure and censorship-resistant data publishing within the Bitcoin blockchain. By leveraging the inherent characteristics of the Bitcoin network, such as its decentralized and immutable nature, the method described here addresses several key challenges in the field of information goods, data inscription, and dissemination. The primary objective of precursive inscriptions is to enhance the security and privacy of data stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, while also mitigating the risk of premature disclosure. One of the most significant advantages of this approach is its ability to ensure that the content remains concealed until the user decides to reveal it. This process not only provides data security but also maintains data integrity and permanence within the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>This leads us to the third and final fork of the information good data markets needed for the modern age; setting the price for wanted but currently unobtained bits.</p><h3>ReQuest</h3><p>ReQuest aims to create a novel data market allowing users to issue bounties for coveted data, seeking the secure and immutable storage of specific information on the Bitcoin blockchain. The primary bounty serves a dual role by covering publishing costs and rewarding those who successfully fulfill the request. Additionally, the protocol allows for the increase of bounties through contributions from other users, increasing the chances of successful fulfillment. Following an inscription submission, users who initiated the bounty can participate in a social validation process to verify the accuracy of the inscribed data.</p><p>Implementing this concept involves a combination of social vetting to ensure data accuracy, evaluating contributions to the bounty, and adhering to specific contractual parameters measured in byte size. The bounty fulfillment process requires eligible fulfillers to submit their inscription transaction hash or a live magnet link for consideration. In cases where the desired data is available but not natively published on Bitcoin — or widely known but currently unavailable, such as a renowned .STL file or a software client update — the protocol offers an alternative method to social consensus for fulfillment, involving hashing the file and verifying the resulting SHA-256 output, which provides a foolproof means of meeting the bounty's requirements. The collaborative nature of these bounties, coupled with their ability to encompass various data types, ensures that ReQuest's model can effectively address a broad spectrum of information needs in the market.</p><p>For ReQuest bounties involving large file sizes unsuitable for direct inscription on the Bitcoin blockchain, an alternative architecture known as Durabit has been proposed, in which a BitTorrent magnet link is inscribed and its seeding is maintained through a Bitcoin-native, time-locked incentive structure. </p><h3>Durabit</h3><p>Durabit aims to incentivize durable, large data distribution in the information age. Through time-locked Bitcoin transactions and the use of magnet links published directly within Bitcoin blocks, Durabit encourages active long-term seeding while even helping to offset initial operational costs. As the bounty escalates, it becomes increasingly attractive for users to participate, creating a self-sustaining incentive structure for content distribution. The Durabit protocol escalates the bounty payouts to provide a sustained incentive for data seeding. This is done not by increasing rewards in satoshi terms, but rather by increasing the epoch length between payouts exponentially, leveraging the assumed long-term price increase due to deflationary economic policy in order to keep initial distribution costs low. Durabit has the potential to architect a specific type of information goods market via monetized file sharing and further integrate Bitcoin into the decades-long, peer-to-peer revolution. </p><p>These novel information good markets actualized by new Bitcon-native tooling can potentially reframe the fight for publishing, finding, and upholding data as the public square continues to erode.</p><h2>Increasing The Cost Of Conspiracy</h2><p>The information war is fought on two fronts; the architecture that incentivizes durable and immutable public data publishing, and the disincentivization of the large-scale gathering of personal data — often sold back to us in the form of specialized commercial content or surveilled by intelligence to aid in targeted propaganda, psychological operations, and the restriction of dissident narratives and publishers. The conveniences offered by walled garden apps and the private-sector-in-name-only networks are presented in order to access troves of metadata from real users. While user metrics can be inflated, the data gleaned from these bots are completely useless to data harvesting commercial applications such as Language Learning Models (LLMs) and current applicable AI interfaces. </p><p>There are two axioms in which these algorithms necessitate verifiable data; the authenticity of the model’s code itself, and the selected input it inevitably parses. As for the protocol itself, in order to ensure replicability of desired features and mitigate any harmful adversarial functionality, techniques such as hashing previously audited code upon publishing state updates could be utilized. Dealing with the input of these LLMs’ learning fodder is seemingly also two-pronged; cryptographic sovereignty over that data which is actually valuable to the open market, and the active jamming of signal fidelity with data-chaff. It is perhaps not realistic to expect your everyday person to run noise-generating APIs that constantly feed the farmed, public datasets with heaps of lossy data, causing a data-driven feedback on these self-learning algorithms. But by creating alternative data structures and markets, built to the qualities of the specific “information good”, we can perhaps incentivize — at least subsidize — the perceived economic cost of everyday people giving up their convenience. The trend of deflation of publishing costs via digital and the interconnectivity of the internet has made it all the more essential for everyday people to at least take back control of their own metadata. </p><p>It is not simply data that is the new commodity of the digital age, but <em>your</em> data: where you have been, what you have purchased, who you talk to, and the many manipulated whys that can be triangulated from the aforementioned wheres, whats, and whos. By mitigating the access to this data via obfuscation methods such as using VPNs, transacting with private payment tools, and choosing hardware powered by certain open source software, users can meaningfully increase the cost needed for data harvesting by the intelligence community and its private sector compatriots. The information age requires engaged participants, incentivized by the structures upholding and distributing the world’s data — their data — on the last remaining alcoves of the public square, as well as encouraged and active retention of our own information.</p><p>Most of the time, a random, large number represented in bits is of little value to a prospective buyer. And yet Bitcoin’s store-of-value property is derived entirely from users being able to publicly and immutably publish a signature to the blockchain, possible only from the successful keeping of a private key secret. A baselayer Bitcoin transaction fee is priced not by the amount of value transferred, but by how many bytes of space is required in a specific block to articulate all its spend restrictions, represented in sat/vbyte. Bitcoin is a database that manages to incentivize users replicating its ledger, communicating its state updates, and utilizing large swaths of energy to randomize its consensus model. </p><p>Every ten minutes, on average, another 4 MB auction. </p><p>If you want information to be free, give it a free market. </p><p><strong><em>This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s</em> <em>“The Inscription Issue”.

To help law enforcement track illegal funds, an increasingly constraining set of anti-money-laundering measures is being implemented across the globe. For the past two decades, it has involved extensive know-your-customer obligations for financial institutions, forced to check their clients’ identities, backgrounds, and the nature of their activities. This system, based on surveillance and the presumption of guilt, has helped the global financial system to efficiently fight criminals by cutting off their money flows.</p><p>Or has it really?</p><p>Real-life numbers tell a different story. Several independent studies have found that AML and KYC policies enable the authorities to recover less than 0.1% of criminal funds. AML efforts cost a hundred times these amounts, but more importantly, they start to threaten our basic right to privacy.</p><p>The instances of absurd demands, like the<a href="https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/il-depose-moins-dun-euro-a-la-banque-on-lui-demande-lorigine-de-ses-fonds-1407713"> one</a> of a French man asked to justify the origin of €0.66 he wanted to deposit, are hardly raising any eyebrows anymore. Regulators face this ridicule without blinking, all while journalists and whistleblowers continue to expose billions of dollars laundered at the highest levels of the same institutions that put their regular clients through a bureaucratic nightmare.</p><p>This suggests that sacrificing our right to privacy may not be justified by the results.</p><p>The blockchain emerging as a free value-transferring system, as opposed to the KYC-gated fiat, has given hope to many personal freedom advocates. However, the regulators’ response was to try and integrate both the acts of buying and transferring crypto into the current AML processes.</p><p>Does it mean that the blockchain has been tamed, with both the entrance and the exit sealed by the AML regulation?</p><p>Luckily, not yet. Or at least, not in every jurisdiction. For example, Switzerland, famous for its practical common sense, often allows companies to define their own risk exposure. This means that people can buy reasonable amounts of crypto without KYC.</p><p>The Swiss example could prove valuable in stopping global AML practices from spiralling out of control and bringing a surveillance state upon the world that used to be known as “free”. It is worth taking a closer look at, but first, let’s see why the traditional AML approach is failing.</p><h2>KYC: the worst policy ever</h2><p>Few people dare to question the effectiveness of the current AML-KYC policies: no one wants to appear on the “criminal” side of the debate. However, this debate is worth having, for our societies appear to be spending an indecent amount of money and effort on something that just does not work as intended.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-money-laundering-is-losing-the-fight-against-dirty-money-europol-crime-rob-wainwright/">noted</a> by the director of Europol Rob Wainwright in 2018: "The banks are spending $20 billion a year to run the compliance regime ... and we are seizing 1 percent of criminal assets every year in Europe."</p><p>This thought was developed in one of the most comprehensive<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/25741292.2020.1725366?needAccess=true&role=button"> studies</a> on the effectiveness of AML, published in 2020 by Ronald Pol from La Trobe University of Melbourne. It found that “the anti-money laundering policy intervention has less than 0.1 percent impact on criminal finances, compliance costs exceed recovered criminal funds more than a hundred times over, and banks, taxpayers and ordinary citizens are penalized more than criminal enterprises.” Furthermore, “blaming banks for not “properly” implementing anti-money laundering laws is a convenient fiction. Fundamental problems may lie instead with the design of the core policy prescription itself.”</p><p>The study uses numerous sources from major countries and agencies, but its author admits it is nearly impossible to reconcile it all. Indeed, as strange as it may seem, despite billions of dollars and euros spent on AML, there is no generalized practice that could allow us to measure its effectiveness.</p><p>The reality, however, is difficult to ignore. Despite the 20 years of modern KYC practices,<a href="https://ocindex.net/report/2023/01-global-illicit-economy.html#key-findings"> organized crime</a> and<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274688/addicts-and-consumers-of-illegal-drugs-worldwide/"> drug use</a> continue to rise. What’s more, a number of high-profile investigations have shown massive money laundering schemes happening at the very top of respected financial institutions. Crédit Suisse helping Bulgarian drug dealers, Wells Fargo (Wachovia) laundering money for the Mexican cartels, BNP Paribas facilitating operations of a Gabonese dictator… This is not to mention tax frauds initiated by the banks themselves: Danske Bank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and so many others have been proven guilty of scamming their countries. Yet, the regulators’ response was to tighten the rules surrounding small retail-sized transfers and create extensive red tape for average law-abiding citizens.</p><p>Why would they choose such cumbersome and inefficient measures? Perhaps the main reason here is that the organizations that define the rules are not responsible for either implementing them or for the end result. This lack of accountability could explain the increasingly absurd rules forcing financial institutions to maintain armies of compliance specialists, and regular people to jump through hoops to perform basic financial operations.</p><p>This reality is not simply frustrating; in a broader historical and political context, it reveals worrisome trends. The increasingly intrusive regulations have set up a framework allowing to efficiently filter people. This means that under the pretext of fighting terrorism, different groups can be cut off from the financial system. This includes politically exposed people, dissenting voices, homeless, non-conformists… or those involved in the crypto space. </p><h2>Crypto AML</h2><p>The blockchain represents a major challenge for the fiat system because of its decentralized nature. Unlike centralized banks burdened with countless AML-related verifications, blockchain nodes simply run user-agnostic code.</p><p>There’s no way a blockchain like Bitcoin could be shaped into the AML mold, however, the intermediaries, also known as VASP (virtual asset service providers), can be. Their AML duties now include two major categories: buying crypto and transferring crypto.</p><p>Transferring crypto falls under the prerogative of FATF, and most countries tend to implement this organization’s recommendations sooner or later. These recommendations include the “travel rule”, which implies that the data about the funds must “travel” together with them. Currently, FATF recommends that any fiat transfer over $1000 must be accompanied by the information on the sender and the beneficiary.</p><p>Different countries impose different thresholds for the travel rule, with $3,000 in the US, €1,000 in Germany, and €0 in France and Switzerland. The upcoming TFR regulation update will impose the mandatory KYC for every crypto transfer starting from €0 in all EU countries.</p><p>The good thing about blockchain, though, is that it does not need intermediaries for transferring value. However, it needs them for buying crypto with fiat.</p><p>The framework for buying crypto is determined by financial regulators and central banks, and this is where the countries’ traditions play an important role. In France, a highly centralized country, an array of minute regulations, on-site inspections, and conferences define market practices in great detail. Switzerland, a decentralized country famous for its direct democracy based on consensus, typically grants financial intermediaries a certain autonomy in managing their own risk appetite.</p><p>Switzerland is also the country where one of the most prominent liberal economists Friedrich Hayek founded the famous Mont Pelerin Society. Even back in 1947, its members were worried about dangers to individual liberty, noting that “Even that most precious possession of Western Man, freedom of thought and expression, is threatened by the spread of creeds which, claiming the privilege of tolerance when in the position of a minority, seek only to establish a position of power in which they can suppress and obliterate all views but their own.”</p><p>Interestingly, a company called Mt Pelerin is operating today on the banks of the Geneva Lake, and this company is a crypto broker.</p><h2>Buying crypto in Switzerland</h2><p>Switzerland is far from the libertarian tax haven that many believe it is. It has succumbed to international pressure by de facto canceling its centuries-old banking secrecy tradition for foreign residents. Now, it is a member of the OECD treaty on the automatic exchange of information, and the zeal with which it applies FATF recommendations shows the willingness to shake off its previously sulfurous image. Indeed, FINMA decided to implement the travel rule for crypto starting from 0€, including for unhosted wallets, as early as 2017. In contrast, the “conservative” European Union will enforce this obligation only in 2024.</p><p>However, when the funds don’t explicitly leave the country, Switzerland still prefers to not micromanage its financial institutions and does not impose tons of paperwork for routine operations. It now stands as one of the rare countries on the old continent where people can buy crypto without being profiled. This means that companies like Mt Pelerin can process retail-size crypto transactions of CHF 1,000 per day without requiring the client to verify their identity. </p><p>This does not mean an open bar, but rather a higher degree of autonomy. For example, Mt Pelerin implements its own fraud detection methods and reserves the right to refuse transactions that raise suspicion. In contrast to the heavily bureaucratic procedures that other countries impose, this approach actually boasts a high success rate at filtering out fraudulent transaction attempts. After all, the firms operating on the front lines often have a better understanding of the ever-evolving fraud tactics than government officials.</p><p>For the sake of our societies, the Swiss approach to AML must be preserved and replicated. In a time when mass surveillance has become routine, and the CBDC development threatens to impose total control over our personal finances, we are closer than ever to the dystopia that Friedrich Hayek feared so much.</p><p>By controlling our day-to-day transactions, any government, even the best-intentioned, could manipulate our lives and effectively “obliterate any views but their own”. That’s why we buy Bitcoin, and that’s why we want to do so without KYC.</p><p>What about the criminals, you might ask? Shouldn’t we cut off their access to money to curb their interest in underground entrepreneurship?</p><p>Admittedly, after 20 years of modern AML, this thesis has proven itself wrong. So why not accept the fact that criminals enter our money flows and just follow that money to expose their operations?

While wealth doesn’t cause infallibility, these entities have the most to lose from making a mistake. They should be highly motivated to put substantial thought and research into the security of their bitcoin.</p><p>Identifying the wealthiest bitcoin holders can be difficult, and asking them to reveal the full details of their security is unlikely to be successful. However, the bitcoin blockchain provides us with some valuable information. The transaction history and balances of all <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-address//?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">bitcoin addresses</a> is <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-utxo-privacy/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">publicly-available knowledge</a>.</p><h2>What information can we gather?</h2><p>If an entity (person or group) owns a lot of bitcoin, it’s possible that they keep their bitcoin spread across many different addresses, each with a smaller-sized balance. Those addresses wouldn’t necessarily stand out from the crowd. In some cases, it’s impossible to associate different addresses with the same wallet or owner. In other cases, association between addresses requires blockchain analysis, often relying on advanced techniques and assumptions which are not guaranteed to provide accurate information.</p><p>Although it’s challenging to definitively identify the wealthiest entities in terms of bitcoin, and precisely how much bitcoin they own, it’s trivial to identify the wealthiest bitcoin addresses. There are <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/bitcoin/richlist/">a few</a> <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">websites</a> that track these addresses in real time. The nature of these addresses can provide a lot of clues about how the bitcoin is secured.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-address-types-compared/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">if you are familiar with address types</a>, you’ll know that any address that begins with a “1” is a P2PKH address, and therefore must be a singlesig arrangement. Similarly, any address that begins with “bc1q” and has a length of 42 characters is a P2WPKH address, and must also be a singlesig address. Bitcoin held by one of these address types isn’t utilizing <a href="https://unchained.com/features/what-is-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">multisig protection</a>. Using SSS or MPC would be the only way to achieve institutional-grade security, <a href="https://unchained.com/features/mpc-vs-multisig-vs-sss/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">as discussed in our article covering thresholds</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, any address that begins with a “3” is a P2SH address. Any address that begins with “bc1q” and has a length of 62 characters is a P2WSH address. These address types have the possibility of utilizing multisig. However, only after bitcoin has been spent out of these addresses will the custody structure be revealed. Some P2SH addresses are actually singlesig, a structure that was temporarily popular while SegWit was being initially adopted. Therefore, if one of these address types has never been spent out of, the custody structure is unknown.</p><figure>

lost</em></p><p><em>**Not using MPC</em></p><p>Out of these 81 addresses, at least six of them are holding bitcoin that is likely to be lost (179,302 BTC). These six addresses were created by their owners in 2010 or 2011, when bitcoin had a much smaller value and was not taken as seriously as it is today. Five of the six have never been spent from, and the other one made its last withdrawal in July of 2010.</p><p>The remaining 75 addresses use a variety of custody structures. Let’s break it down:</p><div><table><thead><th></th><th></th><th></th></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Address Type</p></td><td><p>Addresses (%)</p></td><td><p>Total Bitcoin Balance (%)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Singlesig</p></td><td><p>53 (70.7%)</p></td><td><p>1,745,905 (67.6%)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Multisig</p></td><td><p>16 (21.3%)</p></td><td><p>608,773 (23.6%)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Unknown</p></td><td><p>6 (8.0%)</p></td><td><p>226,205 (8.8%)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As explained in <a href="https://unchained.com/features/mpc-vs-multisig-vs-sss/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">our article discussing institutional-grade threshold security</a>, it’s likely that the 53 singlesig addresses are using either SSS or MPC. Two of the addresses, however, are unlikely to be using MPC, because they were created before 2018, when the first-ever MPC threshold protocols for ECDSA were invented. It’s possible that these addresses are using SSS instead.</p><p>The 16 addresses that we know are using multisig have all been spent out of, and in doing so they have revealed their specific quorum structure. There is a wide assortment of quorums:</p><ul><li>4 instances of 3-of-5</li><li>3 instances of 2-of-3</li><li>2 instances of 2-of-2</li><li>1 instance of 3-of-9</li><li>1 instance of 4-of-8</li><li>1 instance of 3-of-8</li><li>1 instance of 4-of-6</li><li>1 instance of 3-of-6</li><li>1 instance of 2-of-6</li><li>1 instance of 3-of-4</li></ul><p>The 2-of-2 quorums stand out as the only quorums in the list which don’t offer inherent protection from single points of failure. While a distributed 2-of-2 multisig can protect against theft, it requires other methods to protect against loss (such as each key using distributed SSS or MPC shares). You can read more about how different quorums protect from theft and loss to varying degrees, <a href="https://unchained.com/features/what-is-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">in our broader multisig article</a>.</p><figure>

                    <h2>Conclusions</h2><p>After looking at the data, at least one thing is clear. Among the owners of the wealthiest bitcoin addresses—some of whom include the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges and even the U.S. Department of Justice—there is no consensus on the best method to secure bitcoin. </p><p>Some of these entities use multisig addresses, with typical quorums like 2-of-3 and 3-of-5, but there are several unusual quorums as well. Many entities use singlesig addresses, which could be utilizing SSS or MPC. The details surrounding SSS or MPC threshold quorums are never publicly recorded on the blockchain, limiting the extent of this investigation. It’s possible that some of these singlesig addresses are not employing any threshold security at all, which would mean that certain stashes of bitcoin currently worth more than $400M are notably under-secured.</p><p>As we covered in a recent article, multisig <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/multisig-security-ceiling/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">always has a higher security ceiling</a> than singlesig. When a singlesig address is used (as is the case with at least 70% of the addresses holding more than 10,000 BTC) there is a missed opportunity for additional security. While <a href="https://unchained.com/features/singlesig-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">singlesig does provide some benefits</a> for spending convenience and transaction fees, one might expect these benefits to be less important than security, for an entity holding bitcoin worth millions or billions of dollars. </p><p>The truth behind why singlesig addresses are so commonly found at the top levels is unclear. It may amount to a lack of education, or a historical lack of products and services leveraging the combination of SSS and MPC alongside multisig. Luckily, Unchained has pioneered a simple path to access these combinations, unlocking the highest levels of security obtainable. <a href="https://unchained.com/private-wealth-and-enterprise/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">For private wealth and enterprise clients</a>, we offer a vault product built with a foundation of multisig, and keys that can be spread amongst institutional <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-key-agent/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">key agents</a>.

The main areas of focus for these grants center around Latin America, Asia, and Africa.</p><p>This announcement comes only a few months after their <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/human-rights-foundation-grants-500000-to-18-bitcoin-projects-worldwide">last round</a> of grants in December, also donating $500,000 to worldwide Bitcoin projects. While the HRF did not disclose exactly how much money each project is receiving, the following 14 projects are the recipients of today's round of grants worth $500,000 in total:</p><p>USD E-Cash for Bitcoin by <a href="https://twitter.com/callebtc">Calle</a>, a USD-based Chaumian e-cash system built on the <a href="https://cashu.space/">Cashu</a> protocol. This system aims to enable private, affordable, and stable use of USD-denominated credits, all interoperable with the broader Bitcoin Lightning network. USD E-Cash is positioned as an alternative to major stablecoins, in that it does not have any connection to the traditional banking system.

One such solution is a hardware wallet, a physical device that allows you to securely hold the keys to your bitcoin. But hardware wallets aren’t the only option for storing your bitcoin keys—there are also software wallets, paper wallets, and even “brain wallets.” So why specifically choose a hardware wallet?</p><h2>1. Keep your keys offline, protected from remote attacks</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTI5Nzc2NDE0MTQwMTU2/image10.png" height="672" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p><a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-magazine/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch"></a>Hardware wallets enable you to generate and hold the keys to your bitcoin entirely offline, known as cold storage. This stands in contrast to hot wallets, which are more susceptible to remote attacks such as malware and SIM swap attacks (still more secure than a custodian or an exchange!).</p><p>You can think of this as similar to building a ship in a bottle. Your wallet’s seed, which is used to generate the keys to your bitcoin, is generated inside the device and cannot be digitally exported. At no point do the keys ever leave the device. Even if a hardware wallet is connected to a virus-infected computer (which is not recommended), the keys would still be protected, often in a secure element.</p><p>When you want to move your bitcoin, you author a transaction using wallet software, send it to the hardware wallet, sign it <em>on the hardware wallet itself</em> using your private keys, and then send it back to the internet-connected wallet software for it to be broadcast to the bitcoin network.</p><h2>2. Protect against physical attacks</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTI5Nzc2MTQ1Mzc2OTAw/image1.png" height="674" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p><a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-magazine/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch"></a>If someone were to gain physical access to your hardware wallet, there are unique features hardware wallets offer that help you defend against attacks. Some of these security features include a secure element, firmware verification, and PINs for first-layer defense.</p><h3>Secure elements</h3><p>A <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-what-is-a-secure-element/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">secure element</a> is a microprocessor used to isolate, store, and protect sensitive data. In a hardware wallet, a secure element provides a higher level of protection against physical compromise compared to the standard environment on a mobile phone, desktop, or laptop. For example, this makes it more difficult to compromise your device via fault attacks, side-channel attacks, and cold boot attacks.</p><h3>Firmware verification</h3><p>Firmware verification is a way to verify the validity of a hardware wallet’s onboard software. This protects against counterfeit versions and supply-chain attacks. Verifying the firmware ensures the use of a genuine, unaltered version of the hardware. Wallet software from manufacturers like Trezor, Ledger, and others verify the device firmware every time you connect them to your PC.</p><h3>Access PINs</h3><p>Access PINs in many hardware wallets help prevent anyone but the owner from getting immediate access to the ability to sign with the keys stored on the device. In most cases, the penalty for failing to properly enter the PIN over a certain number of tries is an increasing delay between incorrect guesses. With some hardware wallets, exceeding the number of allowable PIN guesses can result in a factory reset of the device or even render it permanently unusable.</p><h3>Duress PINs</h3><p>A duress PIN is a security feature that can help protect your bitcoin in the event of a <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/21-ways-lose-bitcoin/#wrench/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">$5 wrench attack</a>. Duress PINs are particularly important for hardware wallets (due to them being used to secure larger amounts of bitcoin), and the available functionality is particularly robust in some cases.</p><p>For example, the Coldcard hardware wallet offers three types of duress PINs: one that unlocks a decoy wallet, one that destroys the seed upon entry, and one that creates a countdown to customizable “brick modes”. If you end up in a duress scenario, these tools offer you confidence that attackers won’t be able to access your primary bitcoin keys—if any at all.</p><h2>3. Provides a smaller attack surface</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTI5Nzc2MTQ1NDQyNTU2/image3.png" height="672" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p><a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-magazine/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch"></a>It’s possible to store your keys offline with a laptop or desktop and secure them from physical attacks. However, the general-purpose architectures of these devices present a larger attack surface for skilled attackers. This means there are more ways for attackers to exploit software, firmware, and hardware to engineer ways to steal your private keys.</p><p>In contrast, hardware wallets are built with specialized hardware that simplifies their functionality to very specific tasks and limits their connectivity to the internet and other devices. Even with a <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-what-is-a-secure-element/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">secure element</a> to keep key data behind a firewall, some hardware wallets restrict the way they physically connect with external devices—air-gapped hardware wallets primarily interface with other devices via microSD card. Many manufacturers also offer bitcoin-only firmware to further simplify functionality.</p><p>Hardware wallets may be more limited in functionality and convenience than general purposes devices, but that limited functionality also means limited vulnerability. This also has the side benefit of creating less risk for new holes to be discovered that manufacturers must plug with firmware updates or hardware revisions.</p><figure>

                    <h2>4. Prepare for increasing values</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTI5Nzc2MTQ1NDQyNDM2/image4.png" height="672" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p><a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-magazine/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch"></a>You may think you don’t own enough bitcoin for it to be worth the effort to buy a hardware wallet and learn how to securely hold your keys offline. One reason to get a hardware wallet now is to prepare for bitcoin’s upward price swings.</p><p>It’s common bitcoin wisdom to treat your holdings as if they’re worth 10x what they are today—historically, a move like this can come quickly and unexpectedly. Additionally, if your bitcoin holdings would be uncomfortably large for standard singlesig self-custody at a 10x value increase, it may be time to consider a more secure self-custody model such as multisig.</p><h2>5. Confirm addresses on-device</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTI5Nzc2NDEzODc4MDEy/image6.png" height="673" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p><a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-magazine/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch"></a>Because bitcoin transactions are irreversible, it’s important to be certain when you send bitcoin that it goes to the correct address. This is important for both sending bitcoin to someone else and sending bitcoin to a wallet controlled by the keys on the hardware wallet(s) you own.</p><p>With software wallets, malware could replace a real address with an attacker’s address in the UI, making it difficult to verify its authenticity. There’s also “clipper” malware, which <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/21-ways-lose-bitcoin/#:~:text=Clipper%20which%20changes%20a%20bitcoin%20address%20either%20before%20or%20after%20being%20copied%20into%20your%20computer%E2%80%99s%20clipboard%20from%20wallet%20software/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">switches the receiving address in your computer’s clipboard</a>, and <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/21-ways-lose-bitcoin/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">other attack vectors</a>.</p><p>Hardware wallets help with this by including a physical screen that displays the address you want to send funds to, allowing you to verify it prior to spending. As long as your device hasn’t been physically compromised, you can be confident that the address you’re shown is controlled by the keys stored offline on the device. If you’re sending funds to a remote recipient, it’s best to confirm the address you’re sending to through multiple channels.</p><h2>6. An ideal environment to generate your own entropy</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTI5Nzc2MTQ1Mzc3MDIw/image2.png" height="675" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p><a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-magazine/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch"></a>All bitcoin wallets depend on entropy—randomness—to generate seeds, and seeds are the master secret that generates your bitcoin private keys. Entropy can be generated in many ways, from basic on-device random number generators, to long strings of random text entry, to dice rolls or playing cards.</p><p>Dice rolls are widely considered one of the best ways to generate your own entropy, minimizing the involvement of third-parties in generating the randomness needed to initialize a bitcoin wallet. Some hardware wallets, such as Coldcard, allow you to enter dice rolls on-device to generate a seed phrase. You can press 1–6 for each roll and it will use the rolls to generate your seed.</p><p>While you don’t need a hardware wallet to generate your own entropy (you could do so on a permanently offline laptop, for example), hardware wallets uniquely allow you to do so in a way that’s convenient and secure. Generating your own entropy in the physical world can be fun and a great learning exercise, but it’s pointless without the right environment to help you preserve the marginal security you may obtain by doing so.</p><h2>7. Travel more securely</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTI5Nzc2NDEzODEyMzU2/image9.png" height="671" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p><a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-magazine/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch"></a>Traveling with small amounts of bitcoin can be easily done with a mobile phone or another less secure device, but larger amounts of bitcoin require more forethought. Traveling with keys on a laptop computer or mobile device is risky because these devices are usually hot (internet-connected), have more limited physical protections, and have larger attack surfaces.</p><p>Hardware wallets offer convenience and security if you need to keep one or more bitcoin keys on your person while traveling.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about sketchy WiFi connections or USB ports, you can use duress features as described above if someone were to physically attack you, and you’re more protected if your device becomes lost, stolen, or confiscated (attackers would have to do defeat the hardware wallet’s purpose-built security). And they still offer convenient access if you need to spend.</p><h2>8. Enhance the security of multisig setups</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTI5Nzc2NDEzODEyNDc2/image5.png" height="670" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p><a href="https://unchained.com/bitcoin-magazine/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch"></a>Multisig wallets are built by combining multiple keys (versus singlesig wallets that use just one). Requiring more than one key to spend bitcoin adds security and redundancy to your wallet, making them useful for securing larger amounts of bitcoin.</p><p>The more secure the individual keys involved in constructing a multisig wallet are, the more secure the multisig wallet is itself. Hardware wallets enable you to conveniently build a multisig wallet with clearly delineated keys securely held offline. Like with singlesig, hardware wallets also let you verify multisig addresses offline when sending bitcoin.</p><p>Using multiple hardware wallets is a natural fit for multisig because multisig is often used for maximizing security and redundancy for large amounts of cold storage bitcoin, a goal which physical devices and <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/why-you-should-always-secure-your-seed-phrase-four-unexpected-errors/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">seed phrase backups</a> also help you to achieve.</p><h2>Start with self-custody</h2><p>The first step to upgrading your bitcoin security is always to take self-custody, whether hot or cold, to eliminate <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-exchange-bankrupt/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">the risk involved</a> with trusting custodians such as exchanges. From there, you can explore additional security tools, such as multisig, to find the right balance of security and accessibility for your circumstances.</p><figure>

Importantly, the stablecoin's algorithmic monetary policy attempts to remain immune to governance changes or manipulation by administrator keys, aiming to ensure its integrity and reliability.</p><p>“To realize the true value of decentralized finance, crypto needs to break free from infrastructure that is susceptible to exploits and manipulation,” stated Palladium Labs CEO Akash Gaurav. “At Palladium, we designed this stablecoin for resilience and reliability. By leveraging the unique capabilities of the Botanix EVM, we can radically increase the security and reliability of stablecoin access for millions of people using Bitcoin.”</p><p>Operating on the Botanix EVM, which has been in development since early 2023, Palladium leverages the capabilities of this platform to enhance the security and accessibility of stablecoin transactions for Bitcoin users. The Botanix EVM's underlying sidechain protocol, known as the Spiderchain, plays a pivotal role in safeguarding funds transferred from the Bitcoin base layer to the EVM network.</p><p>“The importance of native stablecoins to the technological renaissance happening on Bitcoin cannot be overstated,” said Willem Schroe, inventor of the Spiderchain and co-founder of Botanix Labs. “We are thrilled to support the Palladium team in launching their over-collateralized stablecoin on our EVM network.”</p><p>With the launch of PUSD on Bitcoin's first EVM Layer 2 network, Palladium and Botanix Labs aim to meet the growing demand for secure and efficient DeFi solutions, seeking to pave the way for a new era of financial innovation on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE4MTAxODk1NDA3MjM2/default_digital_coins_0-1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE4MTAxODk1NDA3MjM2/default_digital_coins_0-1.jpg"><media:title>default_digital_coins_0-1</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Luxor and Bitnomial Launch First Ever Bitcoin Hashrate Futures]]></title><description><![CDATA[The contract size for Hashrate Futures will be 1 PH and contracts will have monthly durations.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/luxor-and-bitnomial-launch-first-ever-bitcoin-hashrate-futures</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/luxor-and-bitnomial-launch-first-ever-bitcoin-hashrate-futures</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Futures]]></category><category><![CDATA[luxor]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitnomial]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hashrate]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODU1MzM4MzI1Njk5/bitcoins-network-hash-rate-has-doubled-since-october.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.luxor.tech/">Luxor Technology Corporation</a> (Luxor) and <a href="https://bitnomial.com/">Bitnomial, Inc.</a> have announced the launch of the first US exchange-traded Hashrate Futures, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Set to debut on Bitnomial’s derivatives exchange by the end of this month, these futures contracts are specifically tailored to cater to Bitcoin miners and institutional investors alike.</p><p>“Hashrate has one of the highest volatilities of major commodities, and the April 2024 Bitcoin Halving will exacerbate this volatility,” said Luxor’s Head of Derivatives, Matt Williams. “Bitcoin miners need additional methods to mitigate this price risk to ensure the longevity of their businesses. Exchange-traded hashrate futures will allow them to quickly move in and out of hedging positions to de-risk their revenue streams, and the revenue certainty should improve their credit profile with lenders, which will lower their cost of securing capital.”</p><p>With the impending <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoins-biggest-event-kraken-and-bitcoin-magazine-host-the-2024-bitcoin-halving-livestream-event">2024 Bitcoin Halving</a> in mind, the Hashrate Futures aim to provide miners with a tool to hedge their future revenue streams while offering investors access to a tradable derivative tracking Bitcoin mining hashrate. The contracts, denominated in 1 petahash (PH) units and with monthly durations, will reference Luxor’s Bitcoin Hashprice Index for settlement, effectively tracking the value of the underlying commodity, i.e., hashrate.</p><p>Accessible to those with Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) accounts connected to the Bitnomial exchange, the Hashrate Futures is the latest addition to Luxor’s suite of hashrate financial products. </p><p>“As we approach the Bitcoin halving and witness the unprecedented demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassing the available mined supply, Bitnomial stands as a pivotal bridge in the crypto ecosystem." stated Bitnomial Founder and CEO, Luke Hoersten. “Our listed hashrate and physically delivered bitcoin futures and options empower miners to navigate this evolving landscape seamlessly. Through Bitnomial, miners can efficiently trade hashrate-bitcoin futures spreads, gaining invaluable bitcoin-denominated hashrate exposure while effectively hedging and delivering mined bitcoin directly to consumers via a federally regulated exchange. This convergence of innovation and regulation solidifies Bitnomial's commitment to fostering a robust and accessible marketplace for all participants in the crypto space.”</p><p>As part of Bitnomial’s Bitcoin Product Complex, these physically backed contracts intend to provide a unique opportunity for market participants, with growing interest evidenced by record-high volumes and open interest during Q4 of 2023.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODU1MzM4MzI1Njk5/bitcoins-network-hash-rate-has-doubled-since-october.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MTc5Mjk3ODU1MzM4MzI1Njk5/bitcoins-network-hash-rate-has-doubled-since-october.jpg"><media:title>bitcoins-network-hash-rate-has-doubled-since-october</media:title><media:text>Mining - Bitcoin’s Network Hash Rate Has Doubled Since October</media:text></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy Acquired an Additional 9,245 BTC]]></title><description><![CDATA[MicroStrategy has continued expanding its bitcoin holdings, announcing the purchase of approximately 9,245 bitcoins for around $623 million in cash.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/michael-saylors-microstrategy-9245-btc-620-million</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/michael-saylors-microstrategy-9245-btc-620-million</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vivek Sen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 12:59:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTk4MjA3MzM4NDU2ODI4/giy5m66wqaaarov.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MicroStrategy has continued expanding its bitcoin holdings, announcing the purchase of approximately 9,245 bitcoins for around $623 million in cash today.</p><p>According to the company's <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-acquires-additional-9-245-btc-and-now-holds-214-246-btc_03-19-2024">new press release</a>, it acquired the bitcoin between March 11 and 18, using proceeds from its recent convertible senior notes offering and excess company cash.

                    <p>On March 14, 2024, El Salvador’s president-elect, Nayib Bukele, unveiled a historic bold maneuver that echoed across the Bitcoin world: <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1768425845163503738">El Salvador confirmed the transfer of a substantial portion of its Bitcoin holdings into cold storage</a>, securely kept within a vault in its national borders. This strategic decision marks a pivotal juncture in El Salvador's Bitcoin journey since the introduction of the Bitcoin Law, which has drawn both admiration and skepticism worldwide.</p><p>Amidst a cacophony of critiques ranging from allegations of human rights violations to inadequate modern infrastructure, El Salvador has stood committed, weathering storms of disapproval from traditional finance stalwarts and even fervent Bitcoin maximalists on Twitter (X) Spaces. The veil of ambiguity surrounding the size of El Salvador's Bitcoin reserves, a point of contention and criticism for many, has now been decisively lifted, ushering in a new era of transparency and confidence in the nation's commitment to fostering a thriving Bitcoin-friendly ecosystem.</p><p>With this groundbreaking move, Salvadorans and Bitcoin enthusiasts worldwide have the ability to audit El Salvador's Bitcoin reserves and can see all inbound and outbound transactions. This audacious step wasn't mandated but was taken willingly, embodying El Salvador's commitment to its citizens' trust and the global Bitcoin community's ethos of openness. Unsurprisingly, shortly after Bukele announced <a href="https://mempool.space/address/32ixEdVJWo3kmvJGMTZq5jAQVZZeuwnqzo">El Salvador’s Bitcoin address</a>, Bitcoiners began to<a href="https://twitter.com/Crypto_Mags/status/1768478266762150214"> send donations to the wallet</a>, with nearly 6 Million Sats in transactions as of this writing. To date, plebs can track El Salvador’s <a href="https://mempool.space/tx/c3d23497dcf67f5d179ef2f1d43d61b5d746007a70a09797aef95332f82f8543">daily 1 bitcoin DCA purchases</a>. In this historic moment, El Salvador not only charts a new course in financial governance but also silences its critics by setting a precedent of leading by example in responsibly disclosing and managing its modest but modern sovereign Bitcoin wealth reserves. </p><p>With 5,689 Bitcoins—valued at $385,111,456 USD as of this writing—El Salvador has secured its digital wealth and aptly navigated the treacherous waters of international politics. The decision to shift its Bitcoin holdings from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/07/el-salvador-taps-billionaire-backed-bitcoin-unicorn-in-the-cryptocurrencys-historic-legal-tender-debut/?sh=138d59264fac">Bitgo</a>, an American custodian, to a vault within its sovereign borders wasn't just a public relations masterstroke; it was a strategic imperative. Given the strained relations between the American government and El Salvador over the Bitcoin Law, the mounting holdings under Bitgo's custody risked becoming entangled in potential sanctions and regulatory quagmires. This decisive action safeguards El Salvador's financial autonomy and showcases a shrewd understanding of the intricacies of the American regulatory landscape.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTA4ODY5MzE4MzIxOTE2/image1.png" height="800" width="897">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>While the disclosure of the reserves has garnered widespread approval, there may have been compelling and strategic reasons behind the nation's initial reluctance to divulge its complete holdings. Nayib Bukele's affirmation that only a <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1768425845163503738">“big chunk”</a> of the total Bitcoin reserves has been transferred to cold storage underscores a nuanced understanding of the country’s strategic financial management. In the complex realm of nation-states navigating the uncharted waters of a Bitcoin Standard, maintaining a degree of opacity can be a prudent strategy. El Salvador, in its quest to carve a distinct path in the world, has tactically kept some cards close to its chest, waiting for the opportune moment to unveil its Bitcoin wealth in a calculated move. This wise approach reflects a careful balancing act between transparency and strategic advantage in the dynamic landscape of geopolitics.</p><p>Bukele shed light on El Salvador's Bitcoin holdings in <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1767323587071947195">earlier tweets</a>, surpassing their earlier acquisition strategies and dollar-cost averaging efforts. Contrary to speculations circulating on social media, Bukele revealed a multifaceted approach that had propelled the nation's Bitcoin reserves. Beyond mere purchases, El Salvador's innovative visa program, profits from Bitcoin-to-dollar exchanges held in escrow, revenue from government services, and mining endeavors have collectively contributed to a handsome Bitcoin treasury. This revelation further dispels misconceptions propagated by armchair quarterbacks and highlights El Salvador's innovative courage in leveraging diverse avenues to bolster its growing Bitcoin wealth.</p><p>Disclosing El Salvador's Bitcoin reserves represents a significant stride toward transparency and accountability for its citizens. Yet, it's crucial to recognize that there will always be a segment of critics who demand more and complain about every detail in an attempt to find fault. However, it's essential to remember that these measures are not solely aimed at appeasing detractors. Instead, they serve as a foundational step in creating a positive business environment where Bitcoiners can confidently establish their ventures, knowing that the country is dedicated to their success.</p><p>The ultimate goal for Bukele and El Salvador extends beyond merely silencing critics; it's about transforming the nation into a prosperous hub of opportunity for Salvadorans. In a stroke of genius, El Salvador has built its own digital Fort Knox, with the exceptional feature that citizens can verify the existence of the funds. The Salvadoran government aims to nurture a culture of trust and investment in the country's future by rewarding proof-of-work and low-time preference. This vision encompasses building a new El Salvador where citizens can thrive, seize opportunities at home, and contribute to the nation's growth, rather than seeking elusive promises abroad. As El Salvador continues its journey toward economic empowerment and progress, these strategic moves serve as foundational pillars for a brighter and more prosperous future.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jaime Garcia.

The HSM server has introduced functionality to support atomically swapping two statechains, as well as enforcing an atomic exchange of a statechain for a Lightning payment. This is the first example of concretely defined and built interactions between statechains and the Lightning Network. Synergy between both protocols has been postulated since the concept of a statechain was originally proposed by Ruben Somsen, specifically as a way to solve the limitation of having to transfer a whole statechain UTXO at once.</p><h2>Basic Statechain Swaps </h2><p>In order to support the new swap protocols, the HSM server needs to add some new fields to its database entries tracking each statechain it is facilitating. To facilitate the statechain to statechain swap, the server needs to track:</p><ul><li>Batch_id: a value to associate statechains being swapped in a group.</li><li>Batch-time: a time that starts a counter after which the statechains can be “reclaimed” if the swap fails.</li><li>Locked: a value indicating whether or not the statechain is locked and restricted from regular transfers. </li></ul><p>This allows the HSM server to track and enforce all the variables necessary to ensure a safe atomic swap. When initiating a swap, users have to communicate with each other directly in order to establish a shared batch_id between them. From this point they trade all the necessary information required to facilitate a normal statechain transfer, and send that information plus the batch_id and batch-time to the server. They essentially start the regular transfer process, but also attach the variables to connect the individual statechains as participating in a swap together and how long the timeout period is for that. </p><p>The server at this point will apply a lock to every statechain using the same batch_id in the transfer process. Until the timeout expires, or all of the statechains in its database using the same batch_id have been unlocked by the current owners, the server will not approve any transfers. A neat thing about the way the HSM enforces the swap logic is that it doesn’t matter who contacts the server first. When the server gets a message using a batch_id, it checks every statechain in its database and if there is a pre-existing batch-time for that batch_id it sets it as the same. This ensures that no matter who registers the swap first they all use the same time value for the timeout function. </p><p>Each client involved in the swap at this point checks for and downloads the messages that initiated the transfer protocol, and upon verifying they’re correct sends a message to the server to unlock their statechain, removing the transfer restrictions. Whenever anyone attempts to finalize a transfer on the receiver side of any of the statechains involved in the swap, the server checks to make sure all of the statechains with the same batch_id are unlocked. If even a single one with the related batch_id is still locked the server will finalize a transfer for none of them. If a swap doesn’t succeed before the timeout, the server will continue restricting the finalization of the swap transfer, but will let the current owners initialize a new transfer to themselves to effectively cancel the swap. </p><h2>Lightning Latch</h2><p>The Lightning Latch functionality, swapping a statechain for a Lightning payment, works very similarly to the statechain to statechain swap. Here are the new fields the server must track for the Lightning swap:</p><ul><li>Batch_id: a value to associate statechains being swapped in a group.</li><li>Batch-time: a time that starts a counter after which the statechains can be “reclaimed” if the swap fails.</li><li>Pre-image: the preimage of the Lightning payment, which is generated by the HSM server.</li><li>Locked_1 and locked_2: there are two lock fields for the Lightning swap, one authorized by each user involved.</li></ul><p>Just like with the statechain to statechain swap, the users establish and share a random batch_id. The current statechain owner then messages the server with the batch_id and statechain involved and requests it generates a hashlock preimage for a Lightning payment. This user then generates a Lightning invoice using this preimage, and the second user contacts the server to confirm it generated the preimage. The current statechain owner then begins the statechain transfer process and uploads the transfer message to the server. </p><p>After confirmation of that, the second user trying to swap for the statechain initiates the Lightning payment. At this time the server is the only one with the preimage, so the statechain owner cannot finalize the payment yet. The current owner after verifying the pending Lighting payment sends the server an unlock message to remove the first lock on the statechain. The receiver finally verifies the transfer message, and if valid messages the server to remove their lock as well. </p><p>Now with both locks removed, the HSM server will release the preimage to the current statechain owner to finalize the Lightning payment, and will finalize the statechain transfer to the receiver. </p><p>This scheme does require trusting the statechain operator to function honestly, but that is fundamentally not a change to the pre-existing trust model of using a statechain in general. At no time does the operator have control over users’ funds, nor do they learn anything about the Lightning payment details. </p><h2>What Is This Good For?</h2><p>This scheme is a far cry from the originally posited interaction between statechains and Lightning channels, stacking one on top of the other, but even as a simple starting point this presents functional utility for existing Lightning users. Rebalancing channels is a necessary thing for many nodes, if the capacity is entirely pushed to one side or the other the utility of that channel is limited for routing payments. Many businesses and users have started experimenting with using Liquid as a mechanism for this due to on-chain fees rising and making swaps into and out of the Lightning Network more expensive. </p><p>Statechains offer an alternative mechanism to a federated sidechain to alleviate some of the fee expenses associated with channel balance management. Instead of having to swap out to the mainchain directly, or use a sidechain, funds can be swapped to a statechain and held there until they are needed for swapping funds back into a channel. Similar savings in fees can be had while still maintaining the ability to unilaterally claim your funds on the mainchain. </p><p>Another potential use case (TRIGGER WARNING) would be the possibility of more efficient marketplaces for trading ordinals. Since ordinals are simply an index scheme tracking paths backwards in the transaction history to specific satoshis, they can easily be lifted off-chain onto a statechain. That dynamic in combination with Lightning Latch could allow cheaper and faster off-chain purchases of ordinals. Someone could build a marketplace where they can be sold instantly off-chain over the Lightning Network. </p><p>It’s even possible one day if Lightning clients could become aware somehow of which statechain operators specific Lightning nodes trust that Latch could be used to help route payments by passing statechains around between different nodes instead of using conventional Lightning channels. </p><p>On the front of pure statechain to statechain transfers, this offers the potential for a message passing layer to recreate coinjoin like system mixing coins off-chain, similar to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/a-new-privacy-tool-for-bitcoin">original mixing functionality</a> in Commerceblock’s first statechain implementation. </p><p>While it is a very simple starting point, Lightning Latch and the statechain swap functionality crack open the first door of statechains integrating into the existing Lightning Network – and other similar layers to come in the future – in a way that lets them all integrate seamlessly and function as a singular network in terms of payment routing and liquidity management. Even while we debate the need for and usefulness of covenants, there is still quite a lot of room to continue building with what we already have. </p><p>You can listen to the Commerceblock team explain the logic beyond the protocol here: </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chatting with the Dr <a href="https://twitter.com/TTrevethan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TTrevethan</a> about why to build lightning latch on <a href="https://twitter.com/mercurylayer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mercurylayer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#bitcoin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/layer2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#layer2</a> <a href="https://t.co/CKVG9aHTQ6">pic.twitter.com/CKVG9aHTQ6</a></p>&mdash; Nicholas Gregory (@gregory_nico) <a href="https://twitter.com/gregory_nico/status/1768698677521195512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2024</a></blockquote>

                    </figure>
                    <p>After a lengthy legal dispute, London’s High Court of Justice has formally determined that Australian computer scientist Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin.</p><p>One of the great mysteries of the Bitcoin community since its inception has been quite related to the inception itself: who is Satoshi Nakamoto? This pseudonym is all we have to go on for the identity of that developer or developers who created Bitcoin: writing its <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/reflecting-on-satoshi-white-paper">white paper</a>, mining the Genesis Block, carrying out transactions, and correspondence with persons in the pre-Bitcoin cryptographic community. And yet, when Bitcoin began receiving the tiniest bits of recognition from the broader world, he formally relinquished any authority over Bitcoin as a project and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/what-happened-when-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-disappeared">vanished</a>. In the years since, there have been many attempts to determine Satoshi’s identity, but nothing has borne fruit. </p><p>However, members of the community have not only tried to unmask Satoshi from an outsider’s perspective. There have additionally been efforts from various people to publicly claim that they, in fact, are the true creators of Bitcoin. A particular standout in this respect has been the software developer Craig Wright, who made this bold statement in 2016 and has faced <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/vitalik-buterin-and-joseph-poon-call-out-craig-wright-deconomy-2018">years</a> of ridicule from prominent members of the Bitcoin community. Although Wright has fought back against his detractors through <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/craig-wright-threatens-libel-suit-in-letter-to-bitcoiner-demands-apology">litigious</a> action, he has faced <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/hodlonaut-wins-defamation-case-against-craig-wright">repeated</a> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/judge-rules-against-craig-wright-criticizes-credibility-in-court-decision">defeats</a> on this front. Still, the threat of libel suits has been an ongoing specter over media coverage of Wright’s 8-year claim, and many of his actions have gone underreported as a result. </p><p>Eventually, this stifling atmosphere led the Cryptocurrency Open Patent Alliance (COPA) to take a bold step in 2021 when it <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/copa-suing-craig-wright-over-bitcoin-white-paper-claims">sued</a> him in British courts to obtain a ruling over whether Wright has copyright ownership of Bitcoin’s white paper. This legal battle has not surfaced much in public discourse since this first filing, for understandable reasons, even as British courts <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/court-rules-craig-wright-has-no-bitcoin-copyright">ruled</a> against Wright’s Satoshi claims in suits unrelated to COPA. Although <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/dr-craig-wright-offers-settlement-to-copa-in-legal-confrontations-over-bitcoin">settlement</a> options were pitched by Wright’s legal team, ultimately COPA refused all of them, under the logic that such a settlement would require tacitly accepting his claim. If Craig Wright was only a fraud, after all, he would have no power to offer any concessions on the nature of Bitcoin’s ownership. After years of an apparent holding pattern, the trial <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/the-trial-that-could-end-craig-wrights-satoshi-claim-for-good-started-today">began</a> in February 2024.</p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>A particularly noteworthy <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68567320">tactic</a> used by Wright’s team “repeatedly” was that, if Wright was not truly Satoshi Nakamoto, then the real Satoshi would have to unmask himself to disprove the claim definitively. More than anything else, this particular claim has unearthed a large volume of interest in Satoshi’s true identity. For example, as the trial was approaching in January 2024, nearly $1 million worth of Bitcoin was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/01/07/satoshi-woke-up-legend-of-bitcoins-mystery-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-suddenly-deepens/?sh=3da2da6b51ae">transferred</a> into Satoshi’s wallet from an anonymous source, arousing coverage from major media sites that Bitcoin’s creator might reveal himself. The hubbub from this event led to rampant <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Namecoin/comments/1at960e/there_is_a_claim_that_satoshi_nakamoto_is_hal/">speculation</a>, as image macros began circulating claiming that characters from the two simplified Japanese scripts, katakana and hiragana, would be pronounced as “Satoshi Nakamoto” while resembling the English letters to the name of popular Satoshi candidate Hal Finney.</p><p>Even if Bitcoin was created by enthusiasts in the codebreaking and cryptography scene, this claim is somewhat dubious, as it would require mixing and matching two different Japanese scripts in a haphazard manner. For example, the syllable “to” in Satoshi is a different alphabet than the same syllable in Nakamoto, and there seems to be no steady rule for when these two writing systems alternate. Still, Hal Finney has been dead since 2014, which would explain why Satoshi has remained silent as Bitcoin blossomed to the extreme extent it has in the last ten years. </p><figure>

                    <p>If nothing else, renewed speculation of this nature was a clear sign that the trial had captured Bitcoiners’ collective imagination on the subject. It was a major point of interest then, when multiple early <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-adam-backs-complete-emails-satoshi-nakamoto">developers</a> and Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/newly-revealed-satoshi-email-correspondence-with-martti-malmi">collaborators</a> began submitting private correspondence with Satoshi into the public record to be used as evidence. Adam Back, developer of the 90s “Hashcash” protocol that directly inspired Bitcoin’s mining algorithm, revealed a brief email correspondence initiated by Satoshi where the two discussed Hashcash’s relevance to Bitcoin. Early collaborator Martii “Sirius” Malmi, on the other hand, released a much larger tranche of emails on a broad range of looser topics, totaling 120 pages in all. These emails gave new insight into the personality of Bitcoin’s creator and likely would never have surfaced without the criminal proceedings.</p><p>In any event, as soon as the proceedings had concluded, Justice James Mallor <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/craig-wright-is-not-the-inventor-of-bitcoin-judge-rules">cited</a> the “overwhelming evidence” as he made an immediate ruling against Wright’s claims. COPA <a href="https://www.opencrypto.org/2024-03-13-12-reasons-why-Craig-Wright-is-not-Satoshi-Nakamoto/">released</a> some of the evidence against Wright independently, including the particularly damning accusation that Wright has used ChatGPT to forge documents “on an industrial scale." Their legal team accused Wright of a “massive campaign of dishonesty and forgery” that “stray[ed] into farce," going so far as to claim that Wright was actively fabricating new documents during the course of the five-week trial. Mallor claimed he would give a more detailed account of his reasons at a later date, but the actual verdict is clear: Craig Wright is not Satoshi, is not the author of the white paper, and did not create Bitcoin or its software. </p><p>The importance of this ruling is clear for two main reasons: not only does it prevent Wright from continuing his years-long practice of initiating defamation lawsuits against individuals and media outlets that deny his Satoshi claim, it also prevents him from suing <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/jack-dorseys-bitcoin-legal-defense-fund-prepares-for-tulip-trading-case">developers</a> on the basis of copyright infringement. This “chilling effect” on active Bitcoin developers is a major reason why COPA decided to take on this battle. If nothing else, a firm legal precedent will make it substantially easier to dismiss similar claims in the future. COPA has filed a purely civil suit against Wright, which is unlikely to lead to any sort of direct monetary reparation and certainly will not result in incarceration. Still, the full written judgment has yet to be released. </p><p>Craig Wright’s extended campaign to prove that he is the true Satoshi Nakamoto has turned into one of the long-running features of the Bitcoin space, even as he spent long periods of time under the radar. Around half of Bitcoin’s entire lifespan has included Wright as a figure, resurfacing from time to time to aggressively defend his “reputation and intellectual property” as the true genius behind Bitcoin. It’s anyone’s guess as to how the man, personally, will take this new defeat in his mission. Will he quietly retire from the scene? Will he continue seeking other legal battles on the subject in different jurisdictions? Will the British legal system somehow censure him over this behavior?</p><p>It’s unclear whether or not we can definitively close the book on Craig Wright after this defeat. Still, it’s important to consider how the whole affair has sparked interest in Bitcoin’s origins. Bitcoin has grown to an unimaginable degree since Satoshi Nakamoto first disappeared, and the question of his true identity may seem totally sidelined next to the billions of inflows for the new Bitcoin ETFs or other decidedly 2024 market factors. The early days of Bitcoin still clearly hold sway over our community, however, and this trial has created an opportunity for enthusiasts to scrutinize and debate a wealth of new material from Satoshi.</p><p>The question, then, is less “who is Satoshi Nakamoto” and more “where did Bitcoin come from”? Understanding Bitcoin’s humble origins is very important for understanding its bright future, after all. Even if the world of Bitcoin has been irrevocably transformed by new acceptance from the financial establishment, there are still fundamentals to remember. Bitcoin will always be decentralized, and it will always be a currency. Our goals are not merely to make speculative investments and gain fiat currency, but to radically upset the world of fiat altogether. As long as we can keep our eye on the ball, there’s no telling how far Bitcoin can progress.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTA1NzE1MjAxNzEzNzk2/default_a_british_high_court_judge_1.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTA1NzE1MjAxNzEzNzk2/default_a_british_high_court_judge_1.jpg"><media:title>default_a_british_high_court_judge_1</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTA1NjU5MDk4NzAzNDky/d7d968cf-7d66-4614-a8f4-1533c917c6bc_750x500.jpg"><media:title>d7d968cf-7d66-4614-a8f4-1533c917c6bc_750x500</media:title><media:description><![CDATA[<em><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/121815/bitcoins-price-history.asp">Source</a></em>]]></media:description></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Four Case Studies: Should You Hold Bitcoin In A Roth IRA?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin is generational wealth, but does it make sense to hold bitcoin in your IRA?

Four case studies below will illustrate how by combining Roth IRAs with bitcoin, you can save for retirement, optimize for your personal tax situation during retirement, and leave your bitcoin for the next generation.</p><p>These are hypothetical case studies based on our experiences, not real people. They’re intended to help you better understand how bitcoin Roth IRAs can fit into many types of retirement plans. Hence, they’re for educational purposes—you should discuss all personal situations with a financial, tax, or legal expert.</p><ol><li><a href="https://unchained.com/blog/four-case-studies-bitcoin-roth-ira/#sally">Sally the super stacker: Saving for retirement</a></li><li><a href="https://unchained.com/blog/four-case-studies-bitcoin-roth-ira/#rod">Rod is retirement ready: Entering retirement</a></li><li><a href="https://unchained.com/blog/four-case-studies-bitcoin-roth-ira/#larry">Larry wants to leave a legacy: Inheritance</a></li><li><a href="https://unchained.com/blog/four-case-studies-bitcoin-roth-ira/#wayne">“Why Would I?” Wayne: Reasons not to Roth</a></li></ol><h2>1. Sally the super stacker: Saving for retirement</h2><p>Sally is in her early 30s and has fallen down the bitcoin rabbit hole. Sally views bitcoin as the best savings technology given today’s current macroeconomic backdrop and bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million and is committed to a disciplined accumulation strategy.</p><p>She’s looking for a way to save her hard-earned money without suffering debasement over time. Ultimately, she would like to use her savings for major goals: a dream vacation, a house, starting a family, and maybe retiring someday. But retirement is a distant goal, and she thinks the United States could go through some significant changes before she’s ready to settle down.</p><p>Why would she even bother with the fiat-based American retirement system? The rules, limits, penalties, and potential changes aren’t worth it. Just keep your head down and stack sats, right? Not so fast, Sally.</p><h4>Importance of tax-free growth</h4><p>Like most bitcoiners, Sally is stacking bitcoin with money that has already been taxed. Her payroll taxes are withheld on payday, and she is paid the remaining U.S. dollars into her bank account. She then sends money to an exchange and purchases bitcoin. This is the typical way most people stack sats—post-tax.</p><p>However, just because the bitcoin is purchased post-tax does not mean it won’t be taxed again. Non-retirement bitcoin earnings are taxed as a capital gain when sold. Over her years of stacking, she will need to keep track of her cost basis and deduct that amount from the gross proceeds when selling.</p><p>It’s a simple formula: (final trade) minus (what you paid) equals (what you made). What you make is taxed as capital gains.</p><h4>Enter the Roth IRA</h4><p>This is where a Roth IRA savings vehicle adds value. If Sally were to contribute to a bitcoin Roth IRA, contributions would still be made post-tax—same as before. But the key difference is that qualified Roth IRA distributions are <strong>tax-free</strong>. She only pays tax once, not twice.</p><p>The potential implications of tax-free bitcoin are massive. If the dollar value of bitcoin exponentially increases as Sally expects, then reducing her potential tax burden becomes increasingly rewarding.</p><p>Let’s assume she starts saving $6,000 per year at age 30 until she reaches age 65, and bitcoin grows at 6% annualized (feel free to <a href="https://www.calculator.net/roth-ira-calculator.html">plug in your own assumptions</a>). At age 65, she will have accumulated $822,330. And if she had to pay an estimated 20% capital gains tax, it would amount to a bill over $117,000.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0MzAyMzcyOTc1OTQ1MTU3/group-2085663989.png" height="630" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>In this scenario, a Roth IRA saves her more than $117,000. The Roth becomes a vehicle to supercharge future purchasing power without changing her current taxation. Not having to pay tax on future gains has an exponential impact over time.</p><figure>

                    <h4>Not just retirement: Withdrawing contributions</h4><p>Four years into maximizing her bitcoin Roth IRA contributions, Sally has contributed $24,000 (four years of $6,000 max) and experienced a rapid increase in bitcoin price—a common experience for many bitcoiners. Let’s assume a hypothetical balance of $100,000. To celebrate and reward herself, she has planned a Miami vacation. However, she can’t decide if she should sell her non-retirement bitcoin and pay gains tax or take it from her retirement account and pay penalties.</p><p>With penalty-free access to Roth contributions, Sally can take up to $24,000 (her total contributions) out of her Roth without incurring penalty or tax. In this imaginary scenario, let’s say she ends up pulling $10,000 from the Roth for her Miami vacation.</p><h4>More ways to maximize a Roth</h4><p>If Sally meets someone in Miami, she could pull $10,000 more from the Roth for an elopement wedding. And the house with the picket fence? The Roth allows for some flexibility in that, too: Roth IRAs allow for up to $10,000 of <em>earnings</em> to be withdrawn penalty-free if used for a first-time home purchase. With $4,000 of contributions left and an additional $10,000 in earnings for the first-time home purchase, Sally could combine forces with her equally-wise new spouse—who was also contributing to a Roth—and compile $24,000 for a down payment.</p><p>After the tax- and penalty-free spending spree has subsided, she and her spouse can continue to regularly contribute again, saving for the next big goal, and ultimately for retirement.</p><h4>Key takeaways</h4><p>The Roth account has more flexibility than just saving for the classic age 59 ½ retirement scenario. Tax-free growth is a powerful tool to grow wealth over time and should be strongly considered for any retirement plan. You can pull contributions tax- and penalty-free at any time, and earnings are tax-free at retirement age. Certain conditions even allow you to pull earnings from your Roth without a penalty.</p><h2>2. Rod is retirement ready: Entering retirement</h2><p>Rod has been diligently preparing for retirement. He’s mentally there, but financially not ready to take the leap. Still, bitcoin has become an increasingly important position in his portfolio. What started as a hedge (1-2%) has become a core component (+10%). He holds some bitcoin directly but has more exposure through bitcoin-adjacent assets (GBTC, MicroStrategy, mining stocks, etc.).</p><p>He’s not ready to go all-in on bitcoin because, although he believes in its importance, the volatility conflicts with his desire for financial stability during retirement. He has worked hard to earn his nest egg and would hate for it to disappear—especially to taxes. Within the next 5-10 years, he will transition out of his career and live off his 401k, investment account, real estate equity/income, and bitcoin. Any social security or pension are just a bonus.</p><h4>Brackets and buckets</h4><p>Rod needs to dive into his financial situation and see how his tax brackets will look. What will they look like the Monday morning after he retires? What will they look like after the pension or social security start? What about when the 401k required minimum distributions start at age 72? Knowing where the money is coming from, when it occurs, and how it’s taxed are critical components to retiring—and staying retired.</p><p>To make a plan, Rod needs to think about each account type as being in a different “tax bucket”. His taxable assets are taxed upon sale, and his tax-deferred accounts are taxed when he takes income from them. The Roth provides another bucket: tax-free income. If Rod were to add a Roth IRA, he could pull from different buckets depending on the plan and the need.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0MzAyMzgwMjIzNzAyMTIy/group-2085664143.png" height="630" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>For example, Rod can pull from the Roth in high tax years and keep his bracket from climbing too quickly. He can pull from taxable or Traditional IRAs in low tax years and accelerate that income at a lower marginal rate. More sophisticated strategies could include conversions, delaying income, gifting taxable assets, etc. The key point: Roth allows for diversification in “tax buckets” to optimize your tax bracket in retirement.</p><p>When Rod adds this tax-free bucket to his picture, he decides to fill it with high risk/reward assets like bitcoin. If the growth is tax-free, then it makes sense for it to grow as much as possible. He decides to sell his mining stocks, GBTC, and MSTR and convert that cash into a bitcoin IRA (<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-ira-comparison/">preferably one where he controls access to the keys</a>).</p><h4>Key takeaways</h4><p>What did your bracket look like this year? No, not the March Madness one. The un-fun IRS one. All retirees must consider their expected tax bracket throughout retirement, and tax bracket management is a science and an art. Specifics vary from person to person, but the main concept applies: The more diversified your “tax buckets,” the more flexibility and optionality you will have in any tax environment.</p><h2>3. Larry wants to leave a legacy: Inheritance</h2><p>Larry has been enjoying his time with his wife and grandchildren. He had a successful career and profitable investments that have sustained his lifestyle through retirement. Now, he thinks much more about the next generation and the challenges and struggles they will face. He wants to protect those he cares about and leave the world a better place.</p><p>At first, bitcoin didn’t make sense to him. He thought it was just another get-rich-quick scheme. But given the state of the world today and institutional financial foolishness taking place, he’s now open to seeing its long-term potential. Larry’s main goal is to leave bitcoin for the kids and grandkids. He thinks it could become meaningful for their future when he’s no longer with them.</p><h4>Inheritance and estate considerations</h4><p>When Larry sets up a Roth IRA, he does not ever have to take <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/requiredminimumdistribution.asp#:~:text=A%20required%20minimum%20distribution%20(RMD)%20is%20the%20amount%20of%20money,plan%20participants%20of%20retirement%20age.">Required Minimum Distributions</a> from that account. He can leave the assets there to grow tax-free for the long term—perfect for bitcoin. Larry can easily add or modify beneficiaries to that IRA at any time, and beneficiaries will receive the Roth income tax-free upon his passing. He can accomplish his goal of passing bitcoin to his loved ones. (Estate taxes may still apply, Roth IRAs only avoid income tax.)</p><h4>Converting to a Roth IRA</h4><p>Larry was already retired when the Roth IRA came out in 1997, so he doesn’t have an existing Roth, and you need earned income to contribute. But even though he can’t add money directly to one, he can consider a Roth conversion.</p><p>He can take pre-tax 401k/IRA funds and convert them to Roth, allowing him to pay the tax now and turn it into a tax-free vehicle for future generations. As to whether this is a good idea for your beneficiaries, the math is fairly simple: if you expect your tax rate to be lower than your beneficiaries’ tax rate, then the Roth would make more sense.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <h4>Key takeaways</h4><p>Larry has optionality. If the math makes sense, he could turn a portion of his portfolio into a bitcoin Roth IRA and leave the asset for future generations. It’s worth noting that holding your own keys in an Unchained IRA requires that you also do <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/how-to-inheritance-plan-unchained-vault/">proper inheritance planning</a>.</p><h2>4. “Why Would I?” Wayne: Reasons not to Roth</h2><p>Wayne is in his peak earning years and making really good money at his fiat job. He lives a simple life enjoying a lot of time outdoors, and expects not to need much income after he retires. He has many hobbies, one of which is mining bitcoin with a few machines from his home. It’s not a large-scale operation, just a hobby, but he would consider mining bitcoin with his retirement account if that were an option. Ultimately, he plans to leave all assets he owns to charities that he cares about.</p><h4>Brackets and buckets pt. 2</h4><p>Revisiting the brackets and buckets discussion from above, Wayne’s current income (high bracket) is much greater than his expected future income needs (low bracket). If he were to convert any of his existing retirement assets to Roth, he would be paying a higher rate than if he had just waited to pull it in retirement. From this perspective, it may be wiser to keep the assets in a Traditional pre-tax account and not convert to Roth.</p><h4>Death and taxes…</h4><p>You know the saying: nothing is certain in life but death and taxes. If that’s true, we can certainly add “death taxes” to the list. “Death tax” probably wasn’t too popular in opinion research studies, so “estate tax” is the politically correct term these days. In 2022, the estate tax kicks in around $12 million of net worth ($24 million for married couples). Over time, more and more bitcoiners will need to consider this threshold as it becomes relevant to their situation.</p><p>As Wayne considers a Roth IRA, he should note Roth IRAs do not avoid the estate tax, only the income tax. Wayne plans to leave all assets to charity. Assets left to qualified non-profit entities would avoid both estate and income tax. In his case, there is no benefit to the Roth over his current structure from a taxation-at-death standpoint. If it goes to charity, it avoids the death tax—a silver lining to say the least.</p><h4>Mining in a Roth?</h4><p>Now, let’s re-introduce Wayne’s bitcoin mining hobby. Mining bitcoin within an IRA is technically possible but highly advised against for the average investor. He should be aware of the tax nightmare often involved and consult a tax advisor regarding <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-iras-tax-implications/#:~:text=Unrelated%20Business%20Income%20Tax%2C%20or,generated%20is%20subject%20to%20UBIT.">UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax) within IRA accounts</a>. Additionally, if Wayne wants to hold his mined bitcoin <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/collaborative-custody-is-private/">without revealing personal information to a financial institution</a>, Roth IRAs simply aren’t an option.</p><h4>Key takeaways</h4><p>When considering a financial strategy, no single tool works for every individual’s situation. Factors such as tax bracket, net worth, and charitable intent are all relevant considerations when evaluating a Roth IRA. Mining doesn’t tend to be well-suited for bitcoin IRAs because of UBIT. Due to these factors, a Roth IRA may not be the right route for Wayne.</p><figure>

If a wallet has a single component that—when lost or stolen—can lead to a permanent loss of funds, then it’s simply too dangerous to consider. Nobody wants to keep significant wealth teetering on the edge of catastrophe.</p><p>Individual bitcoin holders have numerous tools available that can help reduce the risk of loss or theft. <a href="https://unchained.com/features/singlesig-vs-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">In a previous article</a>, we covered some of these tools, highlighting modifications commonly applied to singlesig wallets. However, we also explained why these approaches fall short of removing single points of failure entirely.</p><p>For a business, government, or other institution that wants to secure a bitcoin treasury, eliminating single points of failure is not just a nice-to-have, but a prerequisite. The only custody models worth considering for these entities are ones that include a threshold requirement in order to access funds. A threshold requirement describes a structure that involves multiple, separately secured components, where a subset of those components are needed to approve any withdrawal. This is the only way of achieving institutional-grade security, with single points of failure eliminated completely.</p><p>In this article, we’ll cover how to apply threshold security using three different methods: script multisig, Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS), and multi-party computation (MPC). We’ll also dive into the tradeoffs associated with each approach, and how an institution can choose the best setup to meet their needs.</p><figure>

As a quick review, a multisignature wallet involves multiple <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/private_keys">private keys</a>, and can be configured so that a specific number (threshold) of those private keys are required to sign any transaction. The signatures can be produced at different times and locations, allowing each key to remain physically separated. Once a threshold number of signatures have been produced, they can be combined into a single bitcoin transaction capable of spending the funds.</p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>This relatively simple way of creating a threshold requirement is highly effective at removing all single points of failure. As long as the spending threshold is greater than one but less than the total number of keys, then any single key can become lost, stolen or destroyed without bitcoin becoming unrecoverable. The remaining keys could sign a recovery transaction moving funds to a fresh multisig setup.</p><p>Satoshi Nakamoto laid the groundwork for multisig when bitcoin was first released, anticipating that it could be a popular mechanism for securing funds. However, it wasn’t until the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-battle-for-p2sh-the-untold-story-of-the-first-bitcoin-war">P2SH softfork in 2012</a> that multisig started to become a widely used tool. Multisig has since proven itself as a battle-tested security model for more than a decade, across several different <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-address-types-compared/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">address types</a>.</p><h2>What is Shamir’s secret sharing?</h2><p>Shamir’s secret sharing (SSS) is a secret sharing algorithm that was developed by renowned cryptographer Adi Shamir in 1979. It can be used as another way of introducing a threshold requirement for protecting bitcoin. SSS allows users to split a key into several distributed “shares,” with only a certain threshold of the shares needed to reassemble the key. This can be used to design quorums like 2-of-3 or 3-of-5, similar to multisig. </p><figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>However, this approach still leads to single points of failure at certain instances during its lifecycle. One example is when the key is initially split up into SSS shares. This operation is usually done on a single device at a single time and place. If an attacker compromises that device, the key generation process or the share creation process, they’ve compromised the key. Another example is whenever the user needs to reassemble the key to sign a transaction. A threshold number of shares must be brought together, once again on a single device at a single time and place, which an attacker could exploit.</p><p>A fairly simple and widely used method of implementing SSS technology for cryptocurrency custody is through the <a href="https://trezor.io/learn/a/what-is-shamir-backup">Shamir backup</a>, developed by Satoshi Labs in 2017. It can be found as an option in certain Trezor hardware wallet models.</p><figure>

                    <h2>What is MPC?</h2><p>MPC, or multi-party computation, is a subfield of cryptography that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation">traces back to the 1970s</a>. The goal of MPC is to allow multiple participants to jointly perform a computation, while each participant’s contribution to the computation is not revealed to the rest of the group and therefore can remain private. This allows for multiple parties to collaborate in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_problem">various contexts</a> without needing to trust each other.</p><p>When applied to bitcoin custody, MPC involves distributed “shares,” similar to SSS. However, unlike SSS, the shares are not split from a private key nor used to rebuild a private key. Instead, multiple parties compute a single signature directly from a threshold of their shares.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDUwNTgzMzkxMTUxNzQ4/image4.png" height="570" width="1200">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Unlike SSS, MPC does not necessitate a single point of failure. MPC shares can be generated separately from one another, and they never need to be brought together to operate the wallet. Information produced from a share can be communicated to the other participants, without the share itself being revealed.</p><p>Since bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have primarily used a signature system based on ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), MPC had to be adapted for this context. The first practical threshold protocols for ECDSA were published in 2018. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114">GG18</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/987">LNR18</a>]</p><h2>What are the trade-offs between threshold models?</h2><p>With three different threshold security models to choose from, the next step is understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each option.</p><h3>Tradeoffs with multisig</h3><p>Script multisig is a standardized way of achieving threshold security, native to the bitcoin protocol. The structure is considered relatively simple and robust. The barrier to entry is also small—if a bitcoin user knows how to operate a singlesig wallet, then it’s not a large leap to learn how to set up and use a multisig wallet.</p><p>When a multisig wallet is initialized, the addresses produced for receiving bitcoin into the wallet have the threshold requirement built into them. Once a multisig address has been funded, the bitcoin is protected by an immutable contract that has essentially been written into the blockchain itself. The only way to alter the contract (such as changing the access control policy, adjusting which keys are protecting the bitcoin) is to move the bitcoin to a new address that was built with a different contract. For multiple parties who are collaborating to secure bitcoin, this ground-level immutable contract mechanism can provide the highest degree of reassurance that the money is secured according to how all parties have intended. If anything were to be fundamentally changed, it would become obvious to everyone by the occurrence of a public transaction, and the keys that approved the change would be known. This is why collaborative custody providers such as Unchained rely on script multisig for our products.</p><p>However, deploying contracts publicly on the blockchain comes with tradeoffs. As bitcoin is spent out of a multisig address, the access control policy for that address must be permanently published on the blockchain. Observers can then see the details of the multisig quorum that was being used. Although the remaining funds can be easily migrated to a new address going forward, the fact that past security arrangements are exposed isn’t ideal. Additionally, needing to move bitcoin from one address to another in order to adjust the access control policy means that transaction fees are always involved with the process (and the larger the quorum, the more expensive it will be).</p><p>For entities that value custodying altcoins, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, script multisig can pose more of a challenge than the other two methods of threshold security. This is because a multisig threshold quorum is imposed on the blockchain level, and different cryptocurrencies use different blockchains. Many cryptocurrencies don’t even support a native, robust multisig implementation at all. Meanwhile, SSS and MPC enforce threshold quorums at the key level, and look like singlesig transactions publicly. Since almost all cryptocurrencies support a similar standard for singlesig custody (the same key can be used across most cryptocurrencies), this allows SSS and MPC to be more cross-chain compatible.</p><h3>Tradeoffs with Shamir’s secret sharing</h3><p>SSS offers another way of designing a threshold requirement based on relatively simple and battle-tested cryptography. For the purposes of cryptocurrency custody, SSS also has a widely deployed method with a low barrier to entry (<a href="https://trezor.io/learn/a/what-is-shamir-backup">Shamir backup</a>). Once someone has experience using a conventional singlesig wallet, it isn’t a huge leap to use a Trezor to set up a wallet with a Shamir backup.</p><p>Unlike multisig, SSS operates completely outside of public-facing addresses and transactions on the blockchain. Instead, the threshold requirement is decided by how the private key is split into shares. This means that splitting a key into shares and later reassembling them can be done in private, so that only the people participating in the bitcoin custody arrangement are aware that SSS is being used. In addition to privacy advantages, keeping the threshold structure outside of the blockchain also means that SSS transactions won’t lead to increased fees, and it can be used to secure many different cryptocurrencies. Although most cryptocurrencies have their own unique blockchains, they can all share the same private key as an access point, and that key can in turn be split up using SSS.</p><p>The biggest disadvantage to SSS has already been mentioned above—the private key must exist in one place at one time, before it is first split into shares, and also when the shares are recombined for the purposes of approving a withdrawal. These vulnerabilities create temporary single points of failure, meaning that SSS by itself doesn’t offer truly institutional-grade security, unlike multisig or MPC.</p><p>Additionally, SSS doesn’t natively offer a method for adjusting the access control policy. Once a private key is split into a quorum of shares, those shares will always maintain the ability to reproduce that key. If a group is securing a treasury together using SSS and a member of the group leaves, revoking permissions for that individual in a secure manner can pose a challenge. Remaining members of the group could reassemble the key and then split it into new shares, but the old shares would need to be verifiably destroyed. Otherwise, the funds would need to be sent to an entirely new wallet protected by a different key.</p><h3>Tradeoffs with MPC</h3><p>Much like SSS, MPC enforces the threshold requirement at the key-level instead of the blockchain-level. This unlocks similar advantages, such as granting a higher capacity for privacy, avoiding increased transaction fees, and allowing for one MPC custody structure to be used across many different cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Importantly, MPC manages to avoid the temporary single points of failure that come with using SSS. By using a different cryptographic method, the key shares can exist separately from the moment the wallet is first created, and even remain separate while signing withdrawal transactions. Most MPC implementations also include a native method of adjusting the access control policy (creating a new quorum of shares) without having to send funds to a new wallet address.</p><p>However, MPC for threshold ECDSA is considered very complex cryptography, and there is not an agreed-upon standard for using it. There are many different protocols, with the first two being developed independently in 2018 by Gennaro and Goldfeder [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/114">GG18</a>] and Lindell et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/987">LNR18</a>]. Since then, we’ve also seen protocols from Doerner et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/523">DKLs19</a>], Castagnos et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/084">CCL+20</a>], Damgård et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/501">DJM+20</a>], Canetti et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/492">CMP20</a>], Gągol et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/498">GKSS20</a>], Gennaro and Goldfeder [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540">GG20</a>], Canetti et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060">CGG+21</a>], Abram et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1587">ANO+21</a>], Doerner et al. [<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/765">DKLs23</a>], and perhaps others. While the newer protocols tend to make certain improvements upon the older ones, they may have had less opportunity for peer-review, audit, and other testing.</p><p>The higher level of complexity involved with MPC creates a widened attack surface. With additional components and procedures, there is more room for error and potential security vulnerabilities. Evidence of serious security flaws, including full private key extraction attacks, has already presented itself more than once, affecting some of the threshold ECDSA protocols listed above.</p><p>Examples include:</p><p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1052">AS20 vulnerabilities</a>, September 2020, affecting GG18 implementations</p><p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1621">Alpha-Rays vulnerabilities</a>, December 2021, affecting GG18 and GG20</p><p><a href="https://www.verichains.io/tsshock/">TSSHOCK vulnerabilities</a>, August 2023, affecting GG18, GG20, and CGG+21 </p><p><a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/bitforge-fireblocks-researchers-uncover-vulnerabilities-in-over-15-major-wallet-providers/">BitForge vulnerabilities</a>, August 2023, affecting GG18 and GG20<br><br></p><blockquote><p>“Cryptography needs to pass the test of time to attain longevity, and these new protocols clearly didn’t pass the test of time[…] this research was not ready for implementation or widespread adoption. From my perspective, implementing and productizing such recent research is quite dangerous.” — Ledger CTO Charles Guillemet, December 2021 response to Alpha-Rays</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>‍“[MPC is] more complicated, more to get wrong. Advanced crypto protocols are fragile in the detail and in the implementation. I'd feel more confident in multisig, which is super simple and rock solid.” — <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1612878274446639105">Post</a> by renowned cryptographer Adam Back, January 2023</p></blockquote><p>MPC is also limited by who can realistically use it in the first place. As previously mentioned, threshold ECDSA is very complicated. For the average individual, there are no tools available to safely or easily set up MPC independently. While some businesses offer collaborative custody MPC wallets that are fairly easy to use, those businesses offer no easy way for users to recover funds if the business disappears (or no way at all, in which case they are a single point of failure). Because script multisig is a simple and open standard, businesses who provide <a href="https://unchained.com/features/diy-vs-collaborative-multisig/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">collaborative custody solutions</a> using multisig can offer open-source and <a href="https://help.unchained.com/how-to-vault-external-recovery-caravan/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">easy-to-use recovery tools</a>. This creates a straightforward avenue for clients to recover their funds even if the collaborative multisig business were no longer available to assist.</p><h2>Which model is best?</h2><p>As we just covered, there are numerous tradeoffs between using multisig, SSS, and MPC. They can be arranged in a chart for a visual comparison:</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDUwNTgzNjU5MzI1MDYw/image5.png" height="800" width="855">
                        <figcaption><em>This chart demonstrates the strengths (blue) and weaknesses (red) for each method of implementing threshold security. Gray could be a strength or weakness depending on one’s perspective.</em></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>If a business specializes in the custody of many different cryptocurrencies, they might be motivated to hire a team of professionals to carefully set up an MPC custody model. However, if a business or individual were looking for a simple and reliable way to secure bitcoin for the long term, using script multisig and accepting the privacy tradeoffs might be preferable. SSS is rarely used by itself due to its inability to enforce institutional-grade threshold requirements at all times.</p><h3>Combining models for collaborative custody</h3><p>While multisig, SSS, and MPC are often thought of as competing security models, it’s possible to incorporate more than one of them into an overall custody structure. As previously described, SSS and MPC allow a threshold of key shares to produce a signature for a transaction. If the signature was for spending funds out of a singlesig wallet, then nothing else would be required to complete the transaction. However, if instead the signature was for spending funds out of a multisig wallet, additional signatures from other keys could also be needed.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDUwNTgzMzkxNDc5NTQ4/image1.png" height="800" width="1130">
                        <figcaption><em>A 2-of-3 multisig structure, where one possible signature could be produced from a normal key, another possible signature could be produced from a key that is reassembled from 2-of-3 SSS shares, and another possible signature could be produced directly from 2-of-3 MPC shares.</em></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>While this combination of techniques may sound unnecessary and cumbersome, there are indeed some contexts where it makes practical sense. With the rise in popularity of <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-key-agent/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">key agents</a> and <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin-multi-institution-custody/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">multi-institution custody</a>, there is a growing number of specialty businesses that are commissioned by individuals and institutions to secure one of the keys to a multisig wallet. These distributed key agents can help reduce custodial risk. But how should a key agent secure that single key which they are responsible for?</p><p>SSS or MPC can be a strategy to minimize or remove single points of failure from this duty. A corporate key agent can design a system where several different officers within the business each hold key shares, and therefore a signature can only be produced upon agreement from a threshold of those officers. Additionally, if an attack were to occur during an SSS reassembly, or an MPC implementation ends up suffering from a new key extraction vulnerability like the ones listed earlier, then no customer funds are immediately at risk. The key agent would have time to react and address the issue, while the bitcoin remains protected by the broader multisig wallet.</p><p>Using script multisig to create a threshold requirement as a foundational immutable contract, and then commissioning professional key agents to each protect a multisig key using their own SSS or MPC threshold, is far and away the safest method for an institution to keep bitcoin secured for the long-term.</p><h3>New capabilities with Taproot</h3><p><br>In November of 2021, the Taproot soft-fork occurred, adding new tools into the bitcoin ecosystem. Some of these tools impact the future of institutional-grade bitcoin custody, by allowing for certain improvements and optionalities.</p><ul><li><strong>Schnorr signatures: </strong>The Schnorr signature algorithm is now available in bitcoin as an alternative to ECDSA. Using MPC on top of Schnorr leads to threshold security schemes that are far less complicated, and therefore also provide higher confidence in their security, compared to the ECDSA protocols mentioned earlier. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852">FROST</a> is the leading Schnorr threshold signature protocol, while <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki">MuSig2</a> is also available specifically for N-of-N quorums. Both of these signature schemes are on the path to becoming standardized tools across the bitcoin industry, and they are expected to make MPC available for regular individuals, with a user experience similar to script multisig.</li><li><strong>Script type privacy: </strong>Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) addresses are a new <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-address-types-compared/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">address type</a> that allow script multisig bitcoin addresses to appear identical to the addresses being used for singlesig wallets. This provides a significant privacy improvement, because it means that the bitcoin address itself doesn’t provide any clues about its owner’s security model, such as whether or not they might be using script multisig.</li><li><strong>Multiple spending paths:</strong> P2TR addresses also have the ability to contain multiple spending paths built into them. This can create new ways of structuring threshold security for institutional-grade custody, as described in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki">BIP 342</a> (rationale, section 5). For example, a user could create an N-of-N script multisig spending path for every combination of keys that can spend funds. Rather than build a 2-of-3 quorum with keys A, B, and C, a similar outcome can be achieved with three separate 2-of-2 quorums as possible spending paths—one with keys A and B, one with keys A and C, and one with keys B and C. This strategy can increase privacy, because only the spending path that ends up getting used will be revealed. A similar concept can be applied to MPC key share quorums, allowing MuSig2 to be utilized for thresholds.</li></ul><p>These Taproot tools are relatively new, and their adoption is still in the early stages. Many bitcoin softwares and services don’t yet offer full support for what Taproot has to offer. It’s also worth noting that most altcoins don’t have these tools natively available.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>A growing number of institutions are becoming interested in securing a bitcoin treasury, and they require effective solutions. Avoiding single points of failure and minimizing counterparty risk are paramount considerations. The best way to meet these criteria is by leveraging a multisig structure, where keys can be distributed among various enterprise key agents, none of whom will have unilateral control over the bitcoin. Each key agent can use SSS or MPC to add extra threshold protection for their particular key.</p><p>Unchained has pioneered an <a href="https://unchained.com/private-wealth-and-enterprise/?utm_campaign=btcmag-launch">enterprise custody network</a>, built for institutional clients who want to set up an arrangement like this. It’s easy to use and customizable, so that each client gets to choose whether they’d like to hold a controlling number of keys themselves, or just a single key, or leave the responsibility of securing keys entirely up to the several, independent enterprise key agents.

According to critics, these transactions are, at worst, an attack on Bitcoin that tainted the sanctity of scarce blockspace; at best, they are shitcoins, the play-things of gamblers that belong on casino chains like Ethereum.</p><p>Well, miners don’t give a shit if they’re shitcoins. They give a shit about making money, and Ordinals gave them a revenue boost at a time when mining income was at one of its lowest points ever. So many miners have embraced — or at the least, are ambivalent about — Ordinals/inscriptions, since they received a much-needed boost to Bitcoin mining profitability when many miners were nearly breakeven or unprofitable. </p><figure>

                    <p><em>Hashprice is a measure of the USD (or BTC) amount miners can expect to earn from a unit of hashrate (for example, at $80/PH/day, a miner with 1 petahash of mining rigs — roughly 10 new-gen ASICs like the S19j Pro, for example — can earn $80 per day).</em></p><p>Given their positive impact on hashprice, Ordinals, a darkhorse technical advancement that few could have predicted last year, have found themselves at the center of discussions regarding Bitcoin mining economics, discussions that are more germane with each block that pulls us closer to Bitcoin’s fourth block subsidy halving.</p><figure>

                    <p>I’m not writing this to proselytize anyone into becoming an Ordinals enjoooyer. I, for one, don’t really understand the appeal. But I do think that they’re important in the context of Bitcoin’s ever-dwindling block subsidy, so they’re worth studying to understand how they affect blockspace and mining economics — and what developments like them might mean in a future where miners subsist solely on transaction fees. </p><h2>WTF is an Ordinal, Anyway?</h2><p>In NFT parlance, folks use Ordinal and inscription interchangeably, but the individual terms refer to two different aspects of the NFT standard.</p><p>An inscription is a piece of art or digital media, while an Ordinal is technically the number prescribed to an inscription to mark its place in the grand scheme of all other inscriptions. Another way to view it is that the inscription itself is the NFT, while the Ordinal is the number used to identify an individual inscription. </p><p>The data for each inscription lives in the Segregated Witness section of a transaction. As such, unlike other NFT standards, the actual art, digital media, or data is uploaded directly to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Since the inscriptions are fully on-chain, you could argue that they are the purest form of NFT available as they benefit from the blockchain’s immutability. </p><h3>Not All Inscriptions Are Created Equal</h3><p>When you understand that inscriptions are actual on-chain data, you can appreciate some of the critiques and concerns from detractors; if a bunch of NFT degens are inscribing monkey JPEGs and dickbutts and God-knows-what-else on-chain, then this crowds out economic (and potentially necessary) transactions.</p><p>This concern was aggravated by the fact that the arbitrary data for each inscription benefits from a transaction fee discount. As a scalability measure, Bitcoin’s Segregated Witness upgrade modified the transaction structure so that the witness data for a private key signature and public key was moved from the transaction hash field to another part of the block. Bitcoin discounts SegWit data, so it requires fewer satoshis per byte in transaction fees to transact. The arbitrary data for an inscription lives in the SegWit field of a transaction, so it’s entitled to the SegWit discount. Cue the pitchforks. </p><p>This discount is why, despite the first wave of image-based inscriptions clogging block space in February/March/April, transaction fees did not meaningfully increase; block sizes swelled when trendsetting inscribers flushed the blockchain with thousands of JPEGs for the first inscriptions collections, but these all benefited from SegWit’s 4-to-1 data discount versus normal transactions. Perhaps intuitively, it wasn’t until less data-heavy, text-based inscriptions from BRC-20 tokens became the most popular inscription type that transaction fees soared.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDM4OTYzODkzODcyMzgw/image3.png" height="787" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>So-called BRC-20s (a nod to Ethereum’s own ERC-20 token standard) are a loose form of token. I say loose because they are really just Ordinals in a series defined by Bitcoin’s OP_CODE function, where each “token” is itself an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token’s place in the specific BRC-20 series. It goes like this: Someone (God only knows who) publishes an OP_CODE transaction that defines the token series’ max supply, ticker, and the minting limit per transaction. Once publicized, anyone with the technical know-how can mint tokens in the series.</p><p>These OP_CODE transactions do not benefit from SegWit’s data discount, so they cost a pretty penny more than image-based inscriptions. But they also have a feature that image inscriptions don’t: the minting function, which brings Ethereum NFT-esque incentives to collecting these inscriptions. Ethereum NFT series typically have minting contracts where anyone can create new NFTs in the series by interacting with the contract. This is part of — if not the entire — appeal. Minting an NFT is like opening up a digital pack of Pokémon/baseball/Magic: The Gathering cards — maybe there’s a rare card in this next one! </p><p>And while there isn’t necessarily the opportunity to mint a rare BRC-20 (because they are all the same), there’s the chance to mint a bunch of NFTs in a hot new series. Why anyone cares about having ORDI/CUMY/RATS #1 or #100 or whatever, I don’t know. Perhaps it’s the greatest expression of the greater fool theory yet in Bitcoin. But the fact is, they do, and the minting incentives for BRC-20s precipitated the largest wave of Bitcoin transaction activity ever.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDM4OTYzODkzODA2ODQ0/image2.png" height="787" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Through a combination of fee wars and the fact that these NFTs don’t benefit from the SegWit discount, BRC-20s have catered a veritable fee feast for Bitcoin miners, but not exactly in the way you might think.</p><h2>Quantifying Transaction Fee Collateral Damage </h2><p>The bulk of transaction fee increases in 2023 has not come directly from fees associated with Ordinals; it has come from indirect fee pressure on other transactions. </p><p>Per data from independent analyst Data Always’ Dune dashboard, as of November 12, 2023, miners have raked in $70.3 million fees from Ordinals. Seems bigly, but it’s only 19.4% of the $368.2 million in transaction fees that miners have earned in total since inscriptions debuted on December 14, 2022. To put this into further perspective, there have been 40.2 million inscription transactions, which equates to 30% of all transaction volume since December 14. So inscriptions have accounted for one-third of transaction volume over the last year but only one-fifth of all fees. </p><figure>
                        
                        <a href="https://inscriptionissue.bitcoinmagazine.com/how-miners-learned" ><img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDM5MDUxOTQwNjM2NDEy/harper3.jpg" height="791" width="1200"></a>
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>As for the other fees, many of them are the result of indirect fee pressure from inscriptions — that is, fees that do not come directly from inscriptions themselves, but from the pressure that inscriptions exert on the average transaction fee needed to clear a Bitcoin transaction in a reasonable time frame. </p><p>Galaxy Digital Research examines this dynamic in a report titled “Bitcoin Inscriptions & Ordinals: A Maturing Ecosystem”. Rampant inscription activity congests the mempool. This is particularly true during BRC-20 minting events, as the first-come-first-mint incentivizes bidding wars as inscribers gun to be the first to mint a series. This raises the floor for average transaction fees and, as Galaxy Digital Research points out, precipitates transaction fee “overpayment” from various transactors. They define overpayment as any fee in a block that is greater than that block’s median transaction fee. For normal transactions, this overpayment could come from transaction fee estimators in wallets or on exchanges or from general user ignorance regarding transaction fee structure and dynamics. Some users may also need to expedite transactions for any number of reasons, leading to overpayment. For inscription transactions, Galaxy Digital Research says that “voluntary overpayment” was commonplace during times of high activity and popular inscription mints.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDM4OTYzODkzNzQxMzA4/image1.png" height="787" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>This chart quantifies overpayment for inscription transactions and all other transactions to demonstrate the dynamics Galaxy Digital Research outlines in their report. When Bitcoin’s mempool became backlogged in April and May — the hottest time frame for inscription activity so far — a majority of the transaction fees during this time actually came from user overpayment for financial transactions, not inscriptions themselves. These users could probably make it easier on themselves by not using built-in transaction fee estimators with their wallets and exchanges.</p><h2>Blessing and a Curse</h2><p>Inscriptions are a blessing and a curse. They’re a godsend for miners, but they can be a pain in the ass for other Bitcoiners, particularly those who have to send transactions on the network every day. </p><p>That said, blockspace is an open market. So I don’t have to like Ordinals to recognize that it’s not my place to police someone else’s spending. Nor is it my place to censor a transaction that pays for blockspace on the f(r)ee market. That’s part of the point of a permissionless blockchain, after all: to make transactions other people don’t want you to make.</p><p><strong><em>This article is featured in Bitcoin Magazine’s</em> <em>“The Inscription Issue”.

Granted that faith cannot be proved, what harm will come to you if you gamble on its truth and it proves false? If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation, that He exists.”</em></p><p><em>- Blaise Pascal</em></p><p>Blaise Pascal only lived to age 39 but became world-famous for many contributions in the fields of mathematics, physics, and theology. The above quote encapsulates Pascal’s wager—a philosophical argument for the Christian belief in the existence of God. </p><p>The argument's conclusion states that a rational person should live as though God exists. Even if the probability is low, the reward is worth the risk. </p><p>Pascal’s wager as a justification for bitcoin? Yes, I’m aware of the fallacies: false dichotomy, appeal to emotion, begging the question, etc. That is not the point. The point is that <strong>binary outcomes instigate extreme results</strong>, and the game theory of money suggests that it’s a winner-take-all game.</p><h2>The Pascalian investor: A rational approach to bitcoin</h2><p>Humanity’s adoption of “the best money over time” mimics  <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-obsoletes-all-other-money/">a series of binary outcomes—A/B tests</a>.<em> </em></p><figure>

                    <p>Throughout history, inferior forms of money have faded as better alternatives emerged (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24481545">see India’s failed transition to a gold standard</a>). And if bitcoin is trying to be the premier money of the future, it will either succeed or it won’t.</p><p><em>“If you ain’t first, you’re last.” -Ricky Bobby, Talladega Nights, on which monies succeed over time.</em> </p><p>So, we can look at bitcoin success similarly to Pascal’s wager—let’s call it Satoshi’s wager. The translated points would go something like this:</p><ul><li>If you own bitcoin early and it becomes a globally valuable money, you gain immensely. 😀</li><li>If you own bitcoin and it fails, you’ve lost that value. 😢</li><li>If you don’t own bitcoin and it goes to zero, no pain and no gain. 😐 </li><li>If you don’t own bitcoin and it succeeds, you will have missed out on the significant financial revolution of our lifetimes and fall comparatively behind. 😡</li></ul><p>If bitcoin is successful, it will be worth far more than it is today and have a massive impact on your financial future. If it fails, the losses are only limited to your exposure. The most that you could lose is the money that you invested. </p><p>It is hypothetically possible that bitcoin could be worth 100x more than it is today, but it can only possibly lose 1x its value as it goes to zero. The concept we’re discussing here is <strong>asymmetric upside</strong> - significant gains with relatively limited downside. In other words, the potential rewards of the investment outweigh the potential risks. </p><p>Bitcoin offers an asymmetric upside that makes it a wise investment for most portfolios. Even a small allocation provides potential protection against extreme currency debasement.</p><h2>Salt, gasoline, and insurance</h2><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDEyOTc1ODUxOTM5NDYw/0cd74733-4196-4b35-b868-0f29627ab2b9.png" height="800" width="1200">

                    <p><em>“Don’t over salt your steak, pour too much gas on the fire, or buy too much insurance.” </em></p><p>A little bit goes a long way, and you can easily overdo it. The same applies when looking at bitcoin in the context of a financial plan.</p><p>Bitcoin’s asymmetric upside gives it “insurance-like” qualities, and that insurance pays off very well in times of money printing. This was exemplified in 2020 when bitcoin's value increased over 300% in response to pandemic money printing, far outpacing stocks, gold, and bonds. </p><p>Bitcoin offers a similar asymmetric upside today. Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million coins, making it resistant to inflationary debasement. In contrast, the dollar's purchasing power consistently declines through unrestrained money printing. History has shown that societies prefer money that is hard to inflate. </p><p>If recent rampant inflation is uncontainable and the dollar system falters, bitcoin is well-positioned as a successor. This global monetary A/B test is still early, but given their respective sizes, a little bitcoin can go a long way. If it succeeds, early adopters will benefit enormously compared to latecomers. Of course, there are no guarantees, but the potential reward justifies reasonable exposure despite the risks. </p><p>Let’s imagine Nervous Nancy, an extremely conservative investor. She wants to invest but also take the least risk possible. She invests 100% of her money in short-term cash equivalents (short-term treasuries, money markets, CDs, maybe some cash in the coffee can). With this investment allocation, she’s nearly certain to get her initial investment back and receive a modest amount of interest as a gain. However, she has no guarantees that the investment returned to her will purchase the same amount as it used to. Inflation and money printing cause each dollar to be able to purchase less and less over time. Depending on the severity of the inflation, it might not buy anything at all. In other words, she didn’t lose any dollars, but the dollar lost purchasing power. </p><p>Now, let’s salt her portfolio with bitcoin.</p><p>99% short-term treasuries. 1% bitcoin.</p><p>With a 1% allocation, if bitcoin goes to zero overnight, she’ll have only lost a penny on the dollar, and her treasury interest will quickly fill the gap. Not at all catastrophic to her financial future. </p><p>However, if the hypothetical hyperinflationary scenario from above plays out and bitcoin grows 100x in purchasing power, she’s saved everything. Metaphorically, her entire dollar house burned down, and “bitcoin insurance” made her whole. Powerful. A little bitcoin salt goes a long way. </p><p>(When protecting against the existing system, it’s important to remember that you need to get your bitcoin out of the system. Keeping bitcoin on an exchange or with a counterparty will do you no good if that entity fails. If you view bitcoin as insurance, it’s essential to keep your bitcoin in <a href="https://unchained.com/vaults/">cold storage and hold your keys</a>. Otherwise, it’s someone else’s insurance.)</p><h2>When all you have a hammer, everything looks like a…</h2><figure>

                    <p>A construction joke:</p><p><em>There are only three rules to construction: 1.) Always use the right tool for the job! 2.) A hammer is always the right tool! 3.) Anything can be a hammer! </em></p><p>Yeah. That’s what I thought, too. Slightly funny and mostly useless. </p><p>But if you spend enough time swinging a hammer, you’ll eventually realize it can be more than it first appears. Not everything is a nail. A hammer can tear down walls, break concrete, tap objects into place, and wiggle other things out. A hammer can create and destroy; it builds tall towers and humbles novice fingers. The use cases expand with the skill of the carpenter. </p><p>Like hammers, bitcoin is a monetary tool. And a 1-5% allocator to the asset typically sees a “speculative insurance” use case - valid. Bitcoin is speculative insurance, but it is not only speculative insurance. People invest and save in bitcoin for many different reasons. </p><p>I’ve seen people use bitcoin to pursue all of the following use cases: </p><ul><li>Hedging against a financial collapse (speculative insurance)</li><li>Saving for family and future (long-term general savings and safety net)</li><li>Growing a downpayment for a house (medium-term specific savings)</li><li>Shooting for the moon in a manner equivalent to winning the lottery (gambling)</li><li>Opting out of government-run, bank-controlled financial systems (financial optionality)</li><li>Making a quick buck (short-term trading)</li><li>Escaping a hostile country (wealth evacuation)</li><li>Locking away wealth that can’t be confiscated (wealth preservation)</li><li>As a means to influence opinions and gain followers (social status)</li><li>Fix the money and fix the world (mission and purpose)</li></ul><p>Keep this in mind when taking other people’s financial advice. They are often playing a different game than you. They have different goals, upbringings, worldviews, family dynamics, and circumstances. Even though they might use the same hammer as you, it could be for a completely different job. </p><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>A massive allocation to bitcoin may seem crazy to some people, yet perfectly reasonable to others. The same goes for having a 1% allocation. </p><p>But, given today’s macroeconomic environment and bitcoin’s trajectory, I find very few use cases where 0% bitcoin makes sense. By not owning bitcoin, you implicitly say that you are 100% certain it will fail and go to zero. Given its 14-year history so far, I’d recommend reducing your confidence. Nobody is 100% right forever. A little salt goes a long way. Your financial plan may be riskier without bitcoin. Diversify accordingly. </p><p><em>“We must learn our limits.

By receiving an official blessing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), an institutional investing barrier has been lifted.</p><p>With this barrier gone, financial advisors, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies and retail investors can now receive Bitcoin exposure without hassling with direct custodianship. More importantly, a taint has been scrubbed off from Bitcoin, previously likened to “tulip mania”, “rat poison”, or “index of money laundering”.</p><p>Following the unprecedented domino of crypto bankruptcies throughout 2022, Bitcoin price reverted to November 2020 level of $15.7k by the end of that year. After that great FUD reservoir was drained, Bitcoin slowly recovered during 2023 and entered 2024 at $45k level, first visited in February 2021.</p><p>With the 4th Bitcoin halving ahead in April, and with ETFs setting new market dynamics, what should Bitcoin investors expect next? To determine that, one must understand how Bitcoin ETFs elevated BTC trading volume, effectively stabilizing Bitcoin’s price volatility.</p><h2>Understanding Bitcoin ETFs and Market Dynamics</h2><p>Bitcoin itself represents the democratization of money. Not beholden to central authority like the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin’s decentralized network of miners and algorithmically determined monetary policy ensures that its limited 21 million coin supply can’t be tampered with. </p><p>For BTC investors, this means they can be exposed to an asset that is not on an inherent trajectory of devaluation, which is in stark contrast to all existing fiat currencies in the world. This is the foundation for Bitcoin’s perception of value.</p><p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) present another democratization pathway. The purpose of ETFs is to track an asset’s price, represented by shares, and enable trading throughout the day unlike actively managed mutual funds. The ETFs’ passive price tracking ensures lower fees, making it an accessible investment vehicle.</p><p>Of course, it would be up to Bitcoin custodians like Coinbase to enact sufficient <a href="https://cast.ai/cloud-security/">cloud security</a> to instill investor confidence. </p><p>In the ETF universe, Bitcoin ETFs have demonstrated high demand for a decentralized asset that is resistant to centralized dilution. Altogether in the last 15 days, they have resulted in $29.3 billion trading volume against $14.9 billion pressure from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC (GBTC).</p><figure>

                    <p>This is not surprising. As Bitcoin price moved up due to Bitcoin ETF hype, 88% of all Bitcoin holders entered the profit zone in December 2023, eventually reaching <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=BTC&m=supply.LthProfitSum">90%</a> in February. In turn, GBTC investors were cashing out, placing a downward pressure worth $5.6 billion on Bitcoin price.</p><p>Moreover, GBTC investors took advantage of lower fees from the newly approved Bitcoin ETFs, shifting funds from GBTC’s relatively high 1.50% fee. At the end of the day, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the volume winner at 0.12% fee, which will go up to 0.25% after a 12-month waiver period.</p><p>To place this in the context of the wider ETF universe, IBIT and FBTC managed to outpace iShares Climate Conscious & Transition MSCI USA ETF (USCL), launched in June 2023, within a month of trading. </p><figure>

                    <p>This is particularly indicative given that Bitcoin’s history is one of attacks coming from the sustainability direction. It bears reminding that Bitcoin price fell 12%, in May 2021, shortly after <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203">Elon Musk tweeted</a> that Tesla no longer accepts BTC payments precisely due to eco concerns.</p><p>During January, IBIT and FBTC found themselves at 8th and 10th place respectively as ETFs with the largest net asset inflows, headed by iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/etf-flows-investors-curb-their-enthusiasm-january">Morning Star report</a>. With daily ~10,000 BTC streaming into ETFs, this represents a greatly lopsided demand over <a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-mined-per-day/">~900 BTC</a> mined per day.</p><p>Moving forward, as the GBTC outflow pressure wanes and inflow trend increases, the steady stream of funds into Bitcoin ETFs is poised to stabilize BTC price.</p><h2>The Mechanism of Stabilization</h2><p>With 90% of Bitcoin holders entering the profit zone, highest since October 2021, selloff pressures can come from many sources, institutional, miner and retail. The higher inflow trend in Bitcoin ETFs is the bulwark against it, especially heading into another hype event - <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/the-bitcoin-halving-why-this-time-could-be-different">4th Bitcoin halving</a>. </p><p>Higher trading volumes generate higher liquidity, smoothing out price movements. That’s because larger volumes between both buyers and sellers absorb temporary imbalances. During January, <a href="https://etp.coinshares.com/knowledge/market-activity/portfolio-dynamics-january-2024?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Market_PortfolioDynamics_0124&utm_content=Portfolio-dynamics-Jan24">CoinShares’ report</a> showed $1.4 billion of Bitcoin inflows, together with $7.2 billion from newly issued US-based funds, against the GBTC outflows of $5.6 billion.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NTQwNTQ4/image8.png" height="645" width="1200">

                    <p>In the meantime, large financial institutions are setting new liquidity baselines. As of February 6th, Fidelity Canada set up 1% Bitcoin allocation within its <a href="https://www.fidelity.ca/en/products/funds/ace/">All-in-One Conservative ETF Fund</a>. Given its “conservative” moniker, this signals even greater percentage allocations in future non-conservative funds.</p><p>Ultimately, if Bitcoin taps into 1% of the $749.2 trillion market pool of various asset classes, Bitcoin’s market cap could grow to $7.4 trillion, bringing Bitcoin price to $400k.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NDA5NDc2/image5.png" height="800" width="998">

                    </figure>
                    <p>Given that Bitcoin ETFs provide a consistent and transparent market price reference point, large aggregated trades reduce market impact on potential selloffs coming from miners. This is visible from <a href="https://www.falconx.io/newsroom/are-we-entering-a-new-market-regime-the-growing-influence-of-macro-on-crypto-prices">FalconX Research</a>, showing a great uptick in daily aggregate volumes, previously from average 5% heading into the 10 - 13% range.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NDA5NTk2/image2.png" height="530" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>In other words, the new Bitcoin ETF-induced market regime is reducing overall market volatility. So far, Bitcoin miners have been the main price-suppressing driver on the other side of the liquidity equation. In Bitfinex’s latest weekly on-chain report, miner wallets were responsible for 10,200 BTC in outflows.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NTQwNjY4/image6.png" height="713" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>This matches the aforementioned ~10,000 BTC inflows in Bitcoin ETFs, resulting in relatively stable price levels. As miners reinvest and upgrade mining rigs ahead of the 4th halving, another stabilizing mechanism could come into play - options.</p><p>Although the SEC is yet to approve options on spot-traded BTC ETFs, this development will further expand ETF liquidity. After all, the greater spectrum of investing strategies revolving around hedging increases liquidity on both sides of the trade. </p><p>As a forward-looking metric, <a href="https://thetradinganalyst.com/implied-volatility/">implied volatility</a> in options trading gauges market sentiment. But the greater market maturity that we will inevitably see following the introduction of BTC ETFs, we’re more likely to see a more stabilized pricing of options and derivative contracts in general.</p><h2>Analyzing Inflows and Market Sentiment</h2><p>As of February 9th, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) holds 468,786 BTC. Over the last week, the BTC price went up 8.6% to $46.2k. Concurrent with the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-etf-inflows-in-context-">previous forecast</a>, this means that BTC dumping is likely to spread out over multiple rallies ahead of the 4th halving and beyond.</p><p>By latest numbers provided by <a href="https://farside.co.uk/?p=997">Farside Investors</a>, as of February 8th, Bitcoin ETFs have racked up $403 million inflows, totaling to $2.1 billion. GBTC outflows totaled $6.3 billion.</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDE3MTU4MDc2NDc1MDEy/image7.png" height="800" width="585">

                    </figure>
                    <p>From January 11th to February 8th, GBTC outflows have steadily decreased. Within the first week, they averaged $492 million. In the second week, GBTC outflows averaged $313 million, ending in $115 million on average during the third week.</p><figure>

                    <p>On a weekly basis, this represents a 36% reduction on sell pressure from week one to two, and 63% reduction from week two to three.</p><p>As GBTC FUD unfolded up to February 9th, crypto fear & greed index elevated to “greed” at 72 points. This represents a revisit to January 12th, at 71 points, just a few days after Bitcoin ETF approvals.</p><p>Looking ahead, it bears noticing that Bitcoin price is reliant on global liquidity. After all, it was the Fed’s interest rate hiking cycle in March 2022 that caused the avalanche of crypto bankruptcies, culminating in the FTX collapse. Current fed fund futures project the end of that cycle either in May or in June. </p><p>Moreover, it is extremely unlikely that the Federal Reserve will veer off the money printing course. And at such occasions, Bitcoin price followed suit. </p><figure>

                    <p>Considering the insurmountable national debt of $34 trillion, while the federal spending keeps <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/">outpacing revenue</a>, Bitcoin is positioning itself as a safe haven asset. One that waits for capital inflows into its limited 21 million coin supply.</p><h2>Historical Context and Future Implications</h2><p>As a similar safe haven asset, Gold Bullion Securities (GBS) launched as the first gold ETF in March 2003 on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Next year, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) launched on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). </p><p>Within a week from November 18th, 2004, <a href="https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/usa/historical-data/">GLD’s total net assets</a> rose up from $114,920,000 to $1,456,602,906. By the end of December, this decreased to $1,327,960,347. To reach BlackRock’s IBIT market value of <a href="https://www.ishares.com/ch/professionals/en/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust">$3.5 billion</a>, it took GLD up to November 22nd 2005.</p><p>Although not inflation-adjusted, this indicates Bitcoin’s superior market sentiment compared to gold. Bitcoin is digital, yet it is grounded in a proof-of-work mining network spanning the globe. Its digital nature translates to portability which can not be said of gold. </p><p>The USG showcased this point when President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102 in 1933 for citizens to sell their gold bullions. Likewise, new gold veins are frequently discovered which dampens its limited supply status in contrast to Bitcoin.</p><p>In addition to these fundamentals, Bitcoin ETF options are yet to materialize. Nonetheless, Standard Chartered analysts project $50 to $100 billion in Bitcoin ETFs by the end of 2024. Moreover, large companies are yet to follow MicroStrategy’s lead by effectively converting shares sales into a depreciating asset.</p><p>Even 1% BTC allocations across mutual funds are poised to skyrocket BTC price. Case in point, <a href="https://www.streetinsider.com/SEC+Filings/Form+497K+Advisors+Preferred+Trust/22582132.html">Advisors Preferred Trust</a> set up a 15% range allocation into indirect Bitcoin exposure via futures contracts and BTC ETFs. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>After 15 years of doubt and aspersions, Bitcoin has reached the apex of credibility. The first wave of believers in sound money ensured that the blockchain version of it is not lost in the bin of coding history.</p><p>On the back of their confidence, up until now, Bitcoin investors constituted the second wave. The Bitcoin ETF milestone represents the third wave exposure milestone. Central banks around the world continue to erode confidence in money, as governments cannot help themselves but to indulge in spending.</p><p>With so much noise introduced into the exchange of value, Bitcoin represents a return to the sound money root. Its saving grace is digital, but also physical proof-of-work as energy.

When talking about fiat currencies, debasement traditionally refers to the practice of reducing the precious metal content in coins while keeping their nominal value the same, thereby diluting the coin’s intrinsic worth. In a modern context, debasement has evolved to mean the reduction in the value or purchasing power of a currency — such as when central banks increase the supply of money, in the process lowering the nominal value of each unit.</p><h2>UNDERSTANDING DEBASEMENT</h2><p>Before paper money and coins made of cheap metals like nickel, currency consisted of coins made of precious metals like gold and silver. These were the most sought after metals of the time, giving them value beyond government decree. Debasement was a common practice to save on precious metals and use them in a mix of lower-value metals instead.</p><p>This practice of mixing the precious metals with a lower-quality metal means authorities could create additional coins with the same face value, expanding the money supply for a fraction of the cost compared to coins with more gold and silver content.</p><p>Today, coins and notes don't have inherent worth, they are simply tokens that represent value. This means debasement relies on supply: i.e. how many coins or notes the issuing body allows to circulate. Debasement went through different processes and methods over time; therefore, we can define old and new methods.</p><h3>TRADITIONAL METHOD</h3><p>Coin clipping, sweating, and plugging were the most common debasement processes used until the introduction of paper money. Such methods were employed both by malicious actors that counterfeited coins and by authorities that increased the number of coins in circulation.</p><p>Clipping involves “shaving” the coins’ edges to remove some of the metal. As with sweating, the resulting clipped bits would be collected and used to make new counterfeit coins.</p><p>Sweating involves shaking coins vigorously in a bag until the edges of the coins come off and lay at the bottom. The pieces are then collected and used to create new coins.</p><p>Plugging was a way of punching a hole out of the coin’s middle area with the rest of the coin hammered together to close the gap. It could also be sawn in half with a plug of metal extracted from the interior. After filling the hole with a cheaper metal, the two halves would be fused again.</p><h3>MODERN-DAY METHODS</h3><p>Money supply increase is the modern method used by governments to debase the currency. By printing more money, governments get more funds to spend but it results in inflation for its citizens. Currency can be debased by increasing the money supply, lowering interest rates, or implementing other measures that encourage inflation; they’re all “good” ways of reducing the value of a currency.</p><h2>WHY IS MONEY DEBASED?</h2><p>Governments debase their currency so that they can spend without raising further taxes. Debasing money to fund wars was an effective way of increasing the money supply to engage in expensive conflicts without affecting people’s finances — or so it is believed.</p><p>Whether by traditional debasement or modern money printing, money supply increases have short-sighted benefits in boosting the economy. But in the long term, it leads to inflation and financial crises. The effects of this are felt most acutely by those in society who do not own hard assets that might counter the loss in the currency’s value.</p><p>Currency debasement could also occur by malicious actors who introduce counterfeit coins to an economy, but the consequence of being caught can in some countries lead to a death sentence.</p><p><em>“Inflation is legal counterfeiting, Counterfeiting is illegal inflation.”</em> - Robert Breedlove</p><p>Governments can take some measures to mitigate risks associated with money debasement and prevent unstable and weak economies, for example by controlling the money supply and interest rates within a specific range, managing spending, and avoiding excessive borrowing.</p><p>Any economic reform that promotes productivity and attracts foreign investments helps maintain confidence in the currency and prevent money debasement.</p><h2>REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES</h2><h3>The Roman Empire</h3><p>The first example of currency debasement dates back to the Roman Empire under emperor Nero around 60 A.D. Nero reduced the silver content in the denarius coins from 100% to 90% during his tenure.</p><p>Emperor Vespasian and his son Titus had enormous expenditures via post-civil war reconstruction projects like the building of the Colosseum, compensation to the victims of the Vesuvius eruption, and the Great Fire of Rome in 64 A.D. The chosen means to survive the financial crisis was to reduce the silver content of the “denarius” from 94% to 90%.</p><p>Titus’ brother and successor, Domitian, saw enough value in “hard money” and the stability of a credible money supply that he increased the silver content of the denarius back to 98% — a decision he had to revert when another war broke out, and inflation was looming again across the empire.</p><p>This process gradually continued until the silver content measured just 5% in the following centuries. The Empire began to experience severe financial crises and inflation as the money continued to be devalued — particularly during the 3rd century A.D., sometimes referred to as the “Crisis of the Third Century.” During this period, spanning from about A.D. 235 to A.D. 284, Romans demanded higher wages and an increase in the price of the goods they were selling to face currency depreciation. The era was marked by political instability, external pressures from barbarian invasions, and internal issues such as economic decline and plague.</p><p>It was only when Emperor Diocletian and later Constantine took various measures, including introducing new coinage and implementing price controls, that the Roman economy began to stabilize. However, these events highlighted the vulnerabilities of the once-mighty Roman economic system.</p><p>Read More >> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/hard-money-hyperinflation-roman-empire">Hard To Soft Money: The Hyperinflation Of The Roman Empire</a></p><h3>OTTOMAN EMPIRE</h3><p>During the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman official monetary unit, the akçe, was a silver coin that went through consistent debasement from 0.85 grams contained in a coin in the 15th century down to 0.048 grams in the 19th century. The measure to lower the intrinsic value of the coinage was taken to make more coins and increase the money supply. New currencies, the kuruş in 1688 and then the lira in 1844, gradually replaced the original official akçe due to its continuous debasement.</p><h3>HENRY VIII</h3><p>Under Henry VIII, England needed more money, so his chancellor started to debase the coins using cheaper metals like copper in the mix to make more coins for a more affordable cost. At the end of his reign, the silver content of the coins went down from 92.5% to only 25% as a way to make more money and fund the heavy military expenses the current European war was demanding.</p><h3>WEIMAR REPUBLIC</h3><p>During the Weimar Republic of the 1920s, the German government met its war and post-war financial obligations by printing more money. The measure reduced the mark’s value from around eight marks per dollar to 184. By 1922, the mark had depreciated to 7,350, eventually collapsing in a painful <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> when it reached 4.2 trillion marks per USD.</p><p>History offers us poignant reminders of the perils of monetary expansion. These once-powerful empires all serve as cautionary tales for the modern fiat system. As these empires expanded their money supply, devaluing their currencies, they were, in many ways, like the proverbial lobster in boiling water. The temperature — or in this case, the rate of monetary debasement — increased so gradually that they failed to recognize the impending danger until it was too late. Just as a lobster doesn't appear to realize it’s being boiled alive if the water’s temperature rises slowly, these empires didn’t grasp the full extent of their economic vulnerabilities until their systems became untenable.</p><p>The gradual erosion of their monetary value was not just an economic issue; it was a symptom of deeper systemic problems, signaling the waning strength of once-mighty empires.</p><h2>DEBASEMENT IN THE MODERN ERA</h2><p>The dissolution of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s marked a pivotal moment in global economic history. Established in the mid-20th century, the Bretton Woods system had loosely tethered major world currencies to the U.S. dollar, which itself was backed by gold, ensuring a degree of economic stability and predictability.</p><p>However, its dissolution effectively untethered money from its golden roots. This shift granted central bankers and politicians greater flexibility and discretion in monetary policy, allowing for more aggressive interventions in economies. While this newfound freedom offered tools to address short-term economic challenges, it also opened the door to misuse and a gradual weakening of the economy.<br><br>In the wake of this monumental change, the US has experienced significant alterations in its monetary policy and money supply. By 2023, the monetary base had surged to 5.6 trillion dollars, representing an approximate 69-fold growth from its level of 81.2 billion dollars in 1971.</p><p>As we reflect on the modern era and the significant changes in U.S. monetary policy, it’s crucial to heed these historical lessons. Continuous debasement and unchecked monetary expansion can only go on for so long before the system reaches a breaking point.</p><h2>EFFECTS OF DEBASEMENT</h2><p>Currency debasement can have several significant effects on an economy, varying in magnitude depending on the extent of debasement and the underlying economic conditions.</p><p>Here are some of the most impactful consequences that currency debasement can generate over the long term.</p><h3>Higher inflation rates</h3><p>Higher inflation rates are the most immediate and impactful effects of currency debasement. As the currency’s value decreases, it takes more units to purchase the same goods and services, eroding the purchasing power of money.</p><h3>Increasing Interest Rates</h3><p>Central banks may respond to currency debasement and rising inflation by increasing interest rates, which can impact borrowing costs, business investments, and consumer spending patterns.</p><h3>Deteriorating the Value of Savings</h3><p>Currency debasement can deteriorate the value of savings held in the domestic currency. This is particularly detrimental to individuals with fixed-income assets, such as retirees who rely on pensions or interest income.</p><h3>More Expensive Imports</h3><p>A debased currency can make imports more expensive, potentially leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers reliant on foreign goods. However, it may also make exports more competitive internationally, as foreign buyers can purchase domestic goods at a lower price.</p><h3>Undermining Public Confidence in the Economy</h3><p>Continuous currency debasement can undermine public confidence in the domestic currency and the government’s ability to manage the economy effectively. This loss of trust may further exacerbate economic instability and even <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a>.</p><h2>SOLUTION TO DEBASEMENT</h2><p>The solution to debasement lies in the reintroduction of sound money — money whose supply cannot be easily manipulated. While many nostalgically yearn for a return to the gold standard, which was arguably superior to contemporary systems, it is not the ultimate solution. The reason lies in the centralization of gold by central banks. Should we revert to a gold standard, history would likely repeat itself, leading to confiscation and the debasement of currencies once again. Put simply, if a currency can be debased, it will be.</p><h3>How Bitcoin Avoids Debasement</h3><p>Bitcoin offers a permanent solution to this issue. Its supply is capped at 21 million, a number that is hard-coded and safeguarded by proof-of-work mining and a decentralized network of nodes. Thanks to its decentralized nature, no single entity or government can control Bitcoin’s issuance or governance. Furthermore, its inherent scarcity makes it resilient to the inflationary pressures that are typically seen with traditional fiat currencies.</p><p>As a distributed system, Bitcoin users can ensure that the supply never deviates from the predetermined supply cap by running the software that downloads and validates the entire transactional ledger. By verifying every transaction in Bitcoin’s history, where every coin came from and where it went, users can be absolutely sure that the supply has not been debased and no coins were created that should not have been.</p><p>Full node software like this for Bitcoin is essentially a counterfeiting detection machine that anyone can run. It guarantees the supply is intact, that coins being spent were properly authorized, and no funny business is happening. Any Bitcoin wallet software can also ensure that no one can restrict your access to your own money. </p><p>In times of economic uncertainty, or when central banks engage in extensive money printing, investors often turn to assets like gold and bitcoin for their store-of-value properties. As time progresses, there’s potential for people to recognize Bitcoin not just as a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a>, but as the next evolution of money.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDEzMTQ5Nzk4MTE1MDY4/ledger-10-steps-intro---article-preview.png"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/png" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MDEzMTQ5Nzk4MTE1MDY4/ledger-10-steps-intro---article-preview.png"><media:title>ledger-10-steps-intro---article-preview</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy To Raise $500 Million To Buy More Bitcoin ]]></title><description><![CDATA[Just two days ago, MicroStrategy bought $821.7 million worth of bitcoin, and now they're going to buy more.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/michael-saylors-microstrategy-to-raise-500-million-to-buy-more-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/michael-saylors-microstrategy-to-raise-500-million-to-buy-more-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[microstrategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[michael saylor]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 20:45:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTk4MjA3MzM4NDU2ODI4/giy5m66wqaaarov.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MicroStrategy® Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR) has <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-proposed-private-offering-of-500-million-of-convertible-senior-notes_03-13-2024">revealed</a> plans to raise $500 million to buy more bitcoin through a private offering of convertible senior notes due 2031.

Using only the first four letters of the BIP39 seed words, a 12-word seed phrase can be stored in a mere 48 nucleotides of DNA. (For comparison, the average gene is several thousand nucleotides long, and the complete human genome contains over 3 billion nucleotides). Any genetics graduate student could, in just a few days, turn my seed word sequence into an actual strand of DNA and insert that DNA into <em>E. coli </em>or some other suitable host for storage (and propagation) inside a living organism. </p><p>DNA is just one modality for storing and transmitting information. There are numerous other ways to do so and once information is widely distributed it is nearly impossible to extinguish, which is why it will be impossible to stop Bitcoin on a global scale with regulation, legislation, or even violence. The mere fact that you can store a bitcoin private key in DNA demonstrates the futility of attempting to ban Bitcoin. Once unleashed, information is hard to contain. </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkzOTg2MTkwOTExMjI4/image1.png" height="800" width="909">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>But why is information so hard to contain? Perhaps because information is a fundamental entity of the universe. For centuries scientists thought the universe was made only of matter and energy. Today, we know it is made of matter, energy, and information. Information can be stored in matter and transmitted using energy, but information itself is neither. Einstein showed us that matter and energy are interchangeable (E=mc2) but <em>in toto</em> cannot be created nor destroyed. By contrast, information can be created and destroyed, but neither is easy. And once information is created and widely distributed, it is increasingly difficult to destroy. </p><h2>The Parts of Information</h2><p>Information is meant to be sent and received between two or more parties. It is done with a purpose by the sender and is meant to spur action in the receiver. There are five hierarchical components to information:</p><ol><li>Fidelity</li><li>Syntax (code or grammar)</li><li>Semantics (meaning)</li><li>Pragmatics (action)</li><li>Apobetics (purpose)</li></ol><h2>Fidelity</h2><p>Fidelity is the lowest element of information, but it is absolutely necessary for successful transmission. It was once a major issue for cell phone and internet communication. Remember the <em>“Can you hear me now?”</em> commercial? With technical advancements, low fidelity eventually became high fidelity (which weirdly became wireless fidelity, or Wi-Fi). Generally, we are not concerned with fidelity unless it is lacking. (<em>Can you hear me now?)</em></p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkzOTkxMDIyNzQ5MzE2/image2.png" height="603" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <h2>The Code and Language</h2><p>Syntax refers to the code or grammar used for transmitting information. A code is a set of symbols that represent temporally or spatially interconnectable bits of information. That is, symbols can be strung together in time or space to achieve the next level of information (semantics). The symbols used can vary tremendously. They include, among other things, the letters that make up an alphabet, hand gestures (e.g., American Sign Language), musical notes (e.g., those old modem connections and touch tone phones), or the nucleotides in DNA and RNA. The number of symbols used can vary, as well. Most alphabets use 20-35 letters, the nucleotide code uses four chemicals (abbreviated A, U, C, and G), and the binary code employed by computers has just two symbols (0 and 1) representing the on and off states. The number and type of symbols employed are not selected randomly. For instance, they may be determined by the mode of transmission or to meet a specific need (Table 1). </p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA1MTM2NDUxNTk4Mjk2NjQw/table1.jpg" height="321" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>Table 1: Symbols may be chosen for mode of transmission or to meet a specific need.</p><p>A common code is essential for information to be successfully communicated. That is, the code must be known to both the sender and the receiver. Also, because the code is not itself the information but merely the purveyor of information, any particular code can be <em>translated</em> to any other code. For example, written human languages can be translated from one to another: </p><p><em>Go tell it on the mountain…</em></p><p><em>Va le dire sur la montagne…</em></p><p><em>Ve a contario en la montaña…</em></p><p>The above phrase can also be translated, using human eyes, brain, and mouth, from symbols on a page into sound waves (acoustic symbols) in the air, which can be picked up by a microphone and converted to electrical signals in wires and then to radio waves transmitted through space to be picked up by an antenna on the space station, turned back into electrical signals, and then converted by a speaker back into sound waves to be heard by the ears of another human. In the ears of our human astronaut, the signal is converted from waves of air to waves of fluid in the cochlea and then to electrical nerve impulses carried to the brain to be interpreted by neurons. In the brain, those neurons somehow make sense of the original string of symbols, which brings us to the next level of information: semantics or meaning. </p><h2>Semantics, Pragmatics, and Apobetics</h2><p>Semantics is the meaning or intent of a message (a string of symbols). The allocation of meaning to symbols is a mental process. This doesn’t happen at the machine level but at the human level. When you read a book, you are not interested in fidelity (unless it is lacking) or syntax (unless the grammar is horrible or it’s a language you do not understand). Instead, you are interested in the <em>meaning</em> conveyed by the message, i.e., the semantics. Although computers can store and transmit information with ease, and can even perform logic operations via transistors, they cannot meaningfully interpret information the way a human can. Do raspberry pi nodes, hardware wallets, or ASICs understand Bitcoin the way a human does? I think not.</p><p>The aim of meaningful communication is to prompt some action in the recipient. This aim for action represents the pragmatic level of information. The reason the sender wishes to prompt this response is the purpose of the information, which is the apobetic level of information. These highest levels of information require genuine intelligence on both parties, even a will. Whether or not computers can ever possess a will remains to be seen. </p><p>“Go tell it on the mountain…” is a string of symbols (code) that create a meaningful message (semantics) with the sender expecting (apobetics) some response from the receiver (pragmatics). The message can only be received if transmitted adequately (good fidelity). </p><h2>Bitcoin as Information</h2><p>Bitcoin (the program) is computer code written in a particular coding language. From the software to the blockchain to the key pairs of wallets, bitcoin is information. This information can be stored, transmitted, and replicated in flash drives, printed books, or DNA molecules. Because it is now so widely dispersed, it is virtually impossible at this point to destroy. Politicians and bankers may not like it, but the genie is out of the bottle and cannot be stopped now. As they say, you cannot ban Bitcoin, you can only ban yourself from using Bitcoin. </p><p>Fidelity and syntax are the operational parts of information. Semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics are the higher levels of information concerned with the purpose and response of intelligent beings based on the meaning of the message. In Bitcoin, fidelity – or clarity of transmission – is achieved by the internet (and has even been accomplished by HAM radio) connecting a network of nodes, miners, and wallets. The syntax of Bitcoin consists of the coding languages used to write and execute Bitcoin Core and related software on those devices. The meaning, or semantics, of Bitcoin is a perfectly scarce, immutable, digital token. The highest purposes of Bitcoin – the pragmatics and apobetics – are demonstrated in the users that run miners, nodes, and wallets who are motivated and seeking to secure their wealth from theft, either by robbery or debasement. </p><p>The internet is now a mature and high-fidelity communication system. It cannot be destroyed without simultaneously destroying humanity as we know it. The computer codes and languages utilized by Bitcoin are sufficiently distributed such that eliminating them is essentially impossible. But even if you could somehow destroy the fidelity and syntax of the network, the <em>idea</em> of Bitcoin – the semantics, pragmatics, and apobetics – is too widely distributed to defeat. At this point, it has found its way into the minds of millions of people around the globe. Perhaps you could destroy the internet and every last hard drive holding the blockchain and every last computer running Bitcoin, but you would have to hunt down every last Bitcoiner to eradicate the idea of Bitcoin. And who knows, due to the ungovernable actions of some mad scientist, you might have to hunt down all the <em>E. coli</em>, too. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Daniel Howell.

                    <p>Bitcoin has had another period of intense and record-breaking success, spurred on both by positive developments in international business and by increasingly large commitments from the spheres of traditional finance. </p><p>It’s truly stunning how well Bitcoin has been performing throughout the first quarter of 2024. The year began with Bitcoin’s valuation crossing the $40k mark, and March 1 saw a persistent hover around $60k. Now, however, Bitcoin has gone up to $72k, the highest valuation in its entire history. Although we still are not quite at the level where “digital gold” is more valuable than gold itself, we have even reached a new milestone: by market cap, Bitcoin is currently a more <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/11/bitcoins-market-cap-jumps-to-14t-surpassing-silver/">valuable</a> commodity than silver. Considering the immense role that silver has played in global currency for thousands of years, this is certainly a milestone to remember. </p><p>This period of success has been especially noteworthy for the continued confidence it’s been enjoying from some of the largest financial institutions in the world. On March 10, for example, it was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-holds-more-btc-microstrategy">reported</a> that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and prominent issuer of the Bitcoin spot ETF, had finally acquired enough bitcoin that it surpassed even the holdings of MicroStrategy. Considering that its board chairman, Michael Saylor, is such a Bitcoin evangelist, this development seemed especially huge. It was an even bigger surprise, however, when Saylor announced that he was buying enough to <a href="https://decrypt.co/221151/microstrategy-205000-bitcoin-treasury">reclaim</a> its leading position the very next day. Less than 24 hours passed between this original announcement and MicroStrategy’s purchase of 12k bitcoin, and this purchase took place when Bitcoin was already enjoying a price point over $70k. This purchase put MicroStrategy at the head of nearly every other private bitcoin stockpile, from all publicly traded miners to several major exchanges and ETF issuers.</p><iframe height="320" width="480" src="https://bmpro.substack.com/embed"
            frameborder="0" scrolling="no"/></iframe><p>It’s a stunning display of confidence in Bitcoin that anyone is prepared to make such major investments at a time when it’s never been more expensive. It seems that the mood in these companies is that the all-time highs of today will seem like a paltry sum in just a few years. Analysts from ETF issuer Bitwise, for example, were confident enough in their <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/large-corporations-wirehouses-prepare-bitcoin-etf-bitwise">prediction</a> that corporate entities representing trillions of dollars would begin ramping up investments that Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer released an official <a href="https://twitter.com/BitwiseInvest/status/1766162033311973474">memo</a> on the subject. Claiming “serious due diligence” conversations with everyone from hedge funds to massive corporations, the memo predicts that Q2 will see even more massive inflows than the first three months of the year. This just leaves us with one question: Where does this kind of confidence come from?</p><figure>
                        
                        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkyMzIyOTY0ODI1NzMy/5690a0f9-6323-450a-ad26-5dbb9a0a6f7f_1600x466.jpg" height="349" width="1200">
                        
                    </figure>
                    <p>The center of the issue seems to be the runaway success of the Bitcoin ETF and, in particular, BlackRock’s dominating position over the main issuers. Initially, it struggled with Grayscale, which had several natural advantages: it was a Bitcoin-native company with a massive stockpile, it was a real leader in the legal battle to actually get SEC approval, its GBTC was a previously-existing fund that was converted into an ETF, and it had other tricks up its sleeve. Nevertheless, BlackRock is the ETF that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1bb8413e-b974-4e05-933e-7ffedec62bdb">reached</a> $10 billion faster than any other in history, shooting ahead of all other Bitcoin competitors and indeed all ETFs in general. Much of this revenue came from users fleeing GBTC’s high fees, and it seems like a confident industry leader today. Its success has even matured to the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/03/11/indian-crypto-investment-platform-mudrex-to-offer-us-bitcoin-etfs-to-indian-investors/">international</a> stage, as Mudrex, a crypto investment platform based in India, is opening up BlackRock ETF sales to institutional and private investors in a country with more than 1 billion people.</p><p>This kind of success from BlackRock in particular has also led some of its competitors to change up their tactical approach. VanEck, for example, made an <a href="https://twitter.com/vaneck_us/status/1767227350108794991">announcement</a> on March 11 that they were waiving all fees on their Bitcoin ETF for an entire year. This will only continue so long as their VanEck Bitcoin Trust is under $1.5 billion, but the fees after this window will still be some of the lowest available. Grayscale, for its part, is also seeking to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/12/grayscale-gbtc-bitcoin-etf-mini-version">address</a> the problem of high fees by spinning off a “mini-version” of its ETF, offering fractions of Bitcoin for a fraction of GBTC’s fees. It seems that BlackRock’s competitors are not yet willing to concede a market with such tremendous growth potential.</p><p>However, although the ETF market has been especially hot lately, that is not the only reason to believe that Bitcoin’s doing so well. <em>ABC News</em>, for example, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/bitcoin-soars-record-high-uk-approval-crypto-asset/story?id=108004016">credits</a> some positive developments from the United Kingdom as a major factor in Bitcoin’s price jump. Britain has previously been <a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/p/new-uk-rules-cause-consternation">considered</a> a particularly hostile regulatory environment for Bitcoin, especially the ETF, trailing behind both Western Europe and most of the Anglosphere in official Bitcoin approval. It was quite a surprise, then, when the London Stock Exchange (LSE) <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/london-stock-exchange-to-accept-bitcoin-exchange-traded-note-applications">released</a> a new factsheet on exchange-traded notes (ETNs), deciding that this type of financial instrument would be offered on their platform.</p><p>ETNs do differ substantially from ETFs, even those like the Bitcoin futures ETF, which has no direct link to Bitcoin itself. ETNs are a type of debt security and do not even include the proviso that the issuer actually holds the bitcoin in question. Still, they are directly tied to the value of Bitcoin and offer investors a way to gain exposure to the world’s leading digital asset. Considering that these ETNs are subject to the stringent rules that govern securities, it’s particularly interesting that the LSE has suddenly changed its tune on Bitcoin-related financial products. In other words, it seems that the sea change in legal Bitcoin spot ETFs in the United States has undeniably changed the calculus for businesses worldwide. With all these billions flowing into the Bitcoin ETF, even an unfriendly regulator like Great Britain must join in the bonanza if it wishes to maintain relevance as a leading hub of global finance. </p><p>These are just a few of the developments that have occurred in the world of Bitcoin, as the intersection between decentralized currency and traditional finance has become both broader and deeper. Looking forward, there are still plenty of upcoming events, like the halving predicted in April, to keep propelling the hype forward. It may be difficult to predict exactly where the next major development and price jump will come from, but right now it looks as if there is a growing faith coming from some true financial giants. Bitcoin has come an incredibly long way since the days of its total pariah status, and now there’s well over a trillion dollars in the market. With growth like that, it’s an easy win to keep betting on Bitcoin. </p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkyMjg2NzI2MDM5Mjky/rocketmoon.jpg"/><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkyMjg2NzI2MDM5Mjky/rocketmoon.jpg"><media:title>rocketmoon</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjAxMjU3OTE4Njk0MTcyMTYx/mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4.jpg"><media:title>mtg5njayntyzmtmymjm2ode4</media:title></media:content><media:content medium="image" type="image/jpeg" url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTkyMzIyOTY0ODI1NzMy/5690a0f9-6323-450a-ad26-5dbb9a0a6f7f_1600x466.jpg"><media:title>5690a0f9-6323-450a-ad26-5dbb9a0a6f7f_1600x466</media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BitGo Rolls Out RBF Integration for Faster Bitcoin Transaction Processing]]></title><description><![CDATA[BitGo users will now have the capability to replace transactions that are currently stalled with higher fees.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitgo-rolls-out-rbf-integration-for-faster-bitcoin-transaction-processing</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitgo-rolls-out-rbf-integration-for-faster-bitcoin-transaction-processing</guid><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transactions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Rbf]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitgo]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjA0OTcwNTYxMTcwODQzMzg4/b4a8fb4e-1e18-48a9-a277-6fa9d20f8b0a.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bitgo.com/">BitGo</a>, a prominent provider of Bitcoin wallets and custody solutions, has unveiled a new enhancement to its platform with the introduction of Replace-By-Fee (RBF) integration, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.

Spearheaded by Nexo, this global initiative is dedicated to securing an official Bitcoin emoji for digital keyboards everywhere, signaling a monumental step toward recognizing Bitcoin's multifaceted role in society as a revolutionary technology, a form of money, and a cultural phenomenon.</p><p>“Bitcoin's journey reflects a remarkable blend of innovation and community,” stated Kosta Kantchev, Co-founder & Executive Chairman of Nexo. “It's time its significance is recognized universally, starting with a symbol we all understand - an emoji. Join us in making history.”</p><p>The coalition comprises a diverse group of participants including prominent entities such as Bitcoin Magazine parent company BTC Inc, Bitget, Brink, Chainalysis, Hacken, Nansen, and Unstoppable Domains. Together, they aim to celebrate and advocate for Bitcoin's integration into the digital lexicon through the universal language of emojis.</p><p>“Bitcoin is universal money for the world, it needs a universal emoji for every person, young and old to use,” said BTC Inc CEO David Bailey.</p><p>The campaign kicks off with a 50-day petition hosted on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/bitcoin-deserves-an-emoji">Change.org</a>, culminating in an official submission to the Unicode Consortium within the 2024 submission window. This concerted effort marks a renewed push for recognition, building on previous attempts and highlighting the growing importance of Bitcoin in our daily lives.</p><p>Emojis have evolved from their origins in Japan in the 1990s to become foundational elements of digital communication, transcending linguistic and geographical barriers. According to <a href="https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/">Unicode</a>, 92% of internet users worldwide use emojis in their digital communications. The campaign for a Bitcoin emoji is more than symbolic—it's a movement to cement Bitcoin's status as an essential component of modern digital and financial ecosystems worldwide.</p><p>“Supporting Bitcoin's development has always been about paving the way for future innovation. An official emoji is more than a symbol; it's a nod to Bitcoin's technological impact on the world,” said Mike Schmidt, Executive Director of Brink.</p><p>The initiative invites everyone to join this community-driven effort.

                    <p>That car is the Bitcoineta European Edition, and the cheerful guy is Ariel Aguilar. Ariel is part of the European Bitcoineta team, and has previously driven another similar car in Argentina. In fact, there are currently five cars around the world that carry the name Bitcoineta (in some cases preceded with the Spanish definite article “La”).</p><h3>Argentina: the original La Bitcoineta</h3><p>The story of Bitcoinetas begins with the birth of 'La Bitcoineta' in Argentina, back in 2017. Inspired by the vibrancy of the South American Bitcoin community, the original Bitcoineta was conceived after an annual Latin American Conference (<a href="https://www.labitconf.com/">Labitconf</a>), where the visionaries behind it recognized a unique opportunity to promote Bitcoin education in remote areas. Armed with a bright orange Bitcoin-themed exterior and a mission to bridge the gap in financial literacy, La Bitcoineta embarked on a journey to bring awareness of Bitcoin's potential benefits to villages and towns that often remained untouched by mainstream financial education initiatives. Operated by a team of dedicated volunteers, it was more than just a car; it was a symbol of hope and empowerment for those living on the fringes of financial inclusion.</p><figure>

                    <p>Ariel was part of that initial Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and spent weeks on the road when the car became a reality. The original dream to bring bitcoin education even to remote areas within Argentina and other South American countries came true, and the La Bitcoineta team took part in dozens of local bitcoin meetups in the subsequent years.</p><figure>

                    <p>One major hiccup came in late 2018, when the car was crashed into while parked in Puerto Madryn. The car was pretty much destroyed, but since the team was possessed by a honey badger spirit, nothing could stop them from keeping true to their mission. It is a testament to the determination and resilience of the Argentinian team that the car was quickly restored and returned on its orange-pilling quest soon after.</p><figure>

                    <p>Over the more than 5 years that the Argentinian Bitcoineta has been running, it has traveled more than 80,000 kilometers - and as we’ll see further, it inspired multiple similar initiatives around the world.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrG20keYRm4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><blockquote><p>Follow La Bitcoineta’s journey:</p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/labitcoineta">https://twitter.com/labitcoineta</a> </p><p>Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bitcoineta/">https://www.instagram.com/bitcoineta/</a></p></blockquote><h3>El Salvador: Bitcoin Beach </h3><p>In early 2021, the president of El Salvador passed the Bitcoin Law, making bitcoin legal tender in the country. The Labitconf team decided to celebrate this major step forward in bitcoin adoption by hosting the annual conference in San Salvador, the capital city of El Salvador. And correspondingly, the Argentinian Bitcoineta team made plans for a bold 7000-kilometer road trip to visit the Bitcoin country with the iconic Bitcoin car. </p><p>However, it proved to be impossible to cross so many borders separating Argentina and Salvador, since many governments were still imposing travel restrictions due to a Covid pandemic. So two weeks before the November event, the Labitconf team decided to fund a second Bitcoineta directly in El Salvador, as part of the <a href="https://www.bitcoinbeach.com/">Bitcoin Beach</a> circular economy. Thus the second Bitcoineta was born. </p><figure>

On the other side of the planet, in South Africa, Hermann Vivier initiated the <a href="https://bitcoinekasi.com/">Bitcoin Ekasi</a> project. “Ekasi” is a colloquial term for a township, and a township in the South African context is an underdeveloped urban area with a predominantly black population, a remnant of the segregationist apartheid regime. Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as an attempt to introduce bitcoin into the economy of the JCC Camp township located in Mossel Bay, and has gained a lot of success on that front.</p><p>Bitcoin Ekasi was in large part inspired by the success of the Bitcoin Beach circular economy back in El Salvador, and the respect was mutual. The Bitcoin Beach team thus decided to pass on the favor they received from the Argentinian Bitcoineta team, and provided funds to Bitcoin Ekasi for them to build a Bitcoineta of their own. </p><figure>

                    <p>Bitcoin Ekasi emerged as a sister organization of <a href="https://www.thesurferkids.com/">Surfer Kids</a>, a non-profit organization with a mission to empower marginalized youths through surfing. The Ekasi Bitcoineta thus partially serves as a means to get the kids to visit various surfer competitions in South Africa. A major highlight in this regard was when the kids got to meet Jordy Smith, one of the most successful South African surfers worldwide.</p><p>Coincidentally, South African surfers present an intriguing demographic for understanding Bitcoin due to their unique circumstances and needs. To make it as a professional surfer, the athletes need to attend competitions abroad; but since South Africa has tight currency controls in place, it is often a headache to send money abroad for travel and competition expenses. The borderless nature of Bitcoin offers a solution to these constraints, providing surfers with an alternative means of moving funds across borders without any obstacles. </p><figure>

Reach out to one of the existing Bitcoineta teams for guidance, support, and inspiration on how to start your own initiative.
